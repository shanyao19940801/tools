"和平就是比对方的棍子大"

而让千百万人延续寿命  免受饥荒的事吗

那有自己的飞机
of having your own plane

203
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,160

-事实上  真有  -我不喜欢你有安排
- As a matter of fact, I do. - I don't like it when you have plans.

Yeah. Isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year.

226

不喝酒才不负责
It would be irresponsible not to drink.

不清楚情况我睡不着  展示得怎么样
I couldn't sleep till I found out how it went. How'd it go?

297
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,610
很好  看来圣诞节要提前了
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas.

298
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,220
好样的  伙计  明天见了
Way to go, my boy! I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

299
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,440
你怎么没穿我送你的睡衣
Why aren't you wearing those pyjamas I got you?

300
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,000
晚安  托尼
Good night, Tony.

301
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,150
-托尼  -抱歉  这辆车是"欢乐马"
- Hey, Tony. - I'm sorry, this is the "Fun-vee."

302
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,020
"悍无聊马"在后面
The "Hum-drum-vee" Is back there.

303
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,980
-好样的  -基地见
- Nice job. - See you back at base.

304
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,640
我劝你别那么做
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

305
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,440
你对我做了什么
What the hell did you do to me?

306
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,560
我做了什么
What I did?

307
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,250
我做的事是救你命
What I did is to save your life.

308
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,750
我已经尽力移除了很多弹片  但还剩不少
I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left,

309
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,100
而且它们都在往你的房隔去
and it's headed into your atrial septum.

310
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,590
想看看吗
Here, want to see?

311
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,900
我留了纪念品  看看吧
I have a souvenir. Take a look.

312
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,800
我在我的村子里见过不少这样的伤
I've seen many wounds like that in my village.

313
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,320
我们称他们为将死行尸
We call them the walking dead

314
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,490
因为大概要一周
because it takes about a week

315
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,440
弹片才会进入重要器官
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

316
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,110
-这是什么  -那是块电磁铁
- What is this? - That is an electromagnet,

317
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,270
连在了汽车电池上
hooked up to a car battery,

318
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,980
它在阻止弹片进入你的心脏
and it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart.

319
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,900
没错  笑笑
That's right. Smile.

320
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,440
我们见过一次  在伯尔尼的一场科技大会上
We met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern.

321
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,830
-我不记得了  -当然了
- I don't remember. - No, you wouldn't.

322
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,890
如果我喝得那么醉  肯定站都站不直
If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand,

323
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,340
更别说就集成电路发表讲话了
much less give a lecture on integrated circuits.

324
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,460
我们在哪
Where are we?

325
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,730
快起来  起来
Come on, stand up. Stand up!

326
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,510
学我的样子做
Just do as I do.

327
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,580
把手举起来
Come on, put your hands up.

328
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,440
那是我的枪  他们怎么弄到的
Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?

329
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,690
你听懂了没  学我的样子做
Do you understand me? Do as I do.

330
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:53,640
他说"欢迎  托尼·斯塔克  美国历史上
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer

331
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,540
最著名的大屠杀犯"
in the history of America."

332
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,920
他很荣幸
He is honoured.

333
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,880
他要你给他建导弹
He wants you to build the missile.

334
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,840
你展示的那个耶利哥导弹
The Jericho missile that you demonstrated.

335
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,970
这个
This one.

336
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,350
我拒绝
I refuse.

337
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,940
托尼
Tony!

338
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,040
{\an8}斯塔克工业

339
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,300
他问你觉得怎么样
He wants to know what you think.

340
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,230
我觉得你有好多我的武器
I think you got a lot of my weapons.

341
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,770
他说他们有你需要
He says they have everything

342
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,270
拿来建造耶利哥的一切
you need to build the Jericho missile.

343
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,060
他要你列出材料清单
He wants you to make the list of materials.

344
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,950
他说要你立刻开始动手
He says for you to start working immediately,

345
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,070
你做好了  他就放了你
and when you're done, he will set you free.

346
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,630
-不  他不会的  -是啊
- No, he won't. - No, he won't.

347
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,780
他们肯定在找你  斯塔克
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.

348
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,330
但在这些山里  他们是找不到你的
But they will never find you in these mountains.

349
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,160
你刚刚看到一切
Look, what you just saw,

350
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,980
那就是你的遗产  斯塔克
that is your legacy, Stark.

351
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,920
你一生的心血  落在那些杀人犯手里
Your life's work, in the hands of those murderers.

352
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,520
你想这样死去吗
Is that how you want to go out?

353
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,500
这就是伟大的托尼·斯塔克的
Is this the last act of defiance

354
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,950
最后反抗吗
of the great Tony Stark?

355
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,080
还是说你要想想办法
Or are you going to do something about it?

356
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,220
我何必还要做点什么
Why should I do anything?

357
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,230
他们无论如何都会杀了你  杀了我
They're going to kill me, you, either way.

358
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,590
就算不  我大概也活不过一周
And if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week.

359
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,830
那么
Well, then,

360
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,100
这一周就对你至关重要了吧
this is a very important week for you, isn't it?

361
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,620
如果这里要做我的工作站
If this is going to be my work station,

362
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,410
我要灯火通明  这个竖好
I want it well-lit. I want these up.

363
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,950
我需要焊接工具  乙炔和丙烷的都行
I need welding gear. I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.

364
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,950
我需要焊接工作台
I need a soldering station.

365
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,360
头盔  护目镜
I need helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

366
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:09,230
我还要熔炼杯  两组精密工具
I would like a smelting cup. I need two sets of precision tools.

367
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,540
{\an8}斯塔克工业

368
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,540
-你说多少种语言  -好多种
- How many languages do you speak? - A lot.

369
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,700
但看来在这里还是不够用
But apparently, not enough for this place.

370
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,520
他们说阿拉伯语  乌尔都语
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

371
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,220
达里语  帕施图语
dari, Pashto,

372
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,230
蒙古语  波斯语  俄语
Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.

373
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,400
他们是什么人
Who are these people?

374
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,930
他们是你的忠实顾客  先生
They are your loyal customers, sir.

375
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,340
他们自称"十戒组织"
They call themselves the Ten Rings.

376
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,890
如果你告诉我你的计划
You know, we might be more productive

377
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,260
我们的动作可能会更快
if you include me in the planning process.

378
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,610
好吧  我们不需要这个
Okay, we don't need this.

379
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,480
那是什么
What is that?

380
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,300
钯  0.15克
That's palladium, 0.15 grammes.

381
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,710
我们需要至少1.6
We need at least 1.6,

382
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,740
你去把另外11个拆了吧
so why don't you go break down the other 11?

383
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,150
他在干什么
What's he doing?

384
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,290
干活儿
Working.

385
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,450
小心  我们只有一次机会
Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this.

386
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,550
放心  我手很稳
Relax. I have steady hands.

387
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,940
要不你怎么会还活着
Why do you think you're still alive?

388
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,580
-怎么称呼你  -我叫殷森
- What do I call you? - My name is Yinsen.

389
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,020
殷森  认识你很高兴
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

390
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,830
我也很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you, too.

391
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,700
那看上去不像耶利哥导弹
That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.

392
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,490
因为那是个迷你方舟反应堆
That's because it's a miniaturised arc reactor.

393
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,810
我家里有个大的给我的工厂供电
I got a big one powering my factory at home.

394
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,320
这应该足以阻止弹片进入我的心脏
It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.

395
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,870
但它能产生什么
But what could it generate?

396
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,930
如果我没算错  我通常不会算错
If my math is right, and it always is,

397
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,970
每秒能产生3千兆焦耳
three gigajoules per second.

398
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,780
那足以让你的心跳50辈子
That could run your heart for 50 lifetimes.

399
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,790
或者让什么大玩意跑15分钟
Or something big for 15 minutes.

400
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,940
-这是我们逃离的方法  -是什么
- This is our ticket out of here. - What is it?

401
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,000
摊平了看
Flatten them out and look.

402
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,170
厉害
Impressive.

403
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,410
很好
Good.

404
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,350
下得好
Good roll. Good roll.

405
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,520
你还没跟我说你是哪里人
You still haven't told me where you're from.

406
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,620
我来自一个叫科米拉的小镇
I'm from a small town called Gulmira.

407
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,430
-那里其实很不错  -有家人吗
- It's actually a nice place. - Got a family?

408
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,950
有  等我离开这里  就能见到他们
Yes, and I will see them when I leave here.

409
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,780
你呢  斯塔克
And you, Stark?

410
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,870
-没有  -没有吗
- No. - No?

411
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,790
你是个拥有一切的人
So you're a man who has everything

412
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,760
却一无所有
and nothing.

413
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,870
看上去完全不像照片上的东西
It doesn't look anything like the picture.

414
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,580
或许是改装过了
Maybe it's been modified.

415
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,650
尾翼不对
The tail is wrong.

416
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,100
就是倒过来了
It's just backwards.

417
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,480
放松
Relax.

418
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,860
弓和箭
The bow and arrow

419
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,930
曾是武器科技的巅峰
once was the pinnacle of weapons technology.

420
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,460
让伟大的成吉思汗
It allowed the great Genghis Khan

421
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,780
一统从太平洋到乌克兰之间的土地
to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.

422
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,030
他的帝国是亚历山大大帝的两倍
An empire twice the size of Alexander the Great

423
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,650
是罗马帝国的四倍
and four times the size of the Roman Empire.

424
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,370
但今天
But today,

425
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:47,200
有最新的斯塔克工业武器的人
whoever holds the latest Stark weapons

426
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,790
就能统治这些土地
rules these lands.

427
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,140
很快
And soon,

428
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,960
就要轮到我了
it will be my turn.

429
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,990
你为什么让我失望了
Why have you failed me?

430
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,010
我们在工作
We're working.

431
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,980
非常努力
Diligently.

432
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,850
我留了你一命
I let you live.

433
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,250
你就如此回报我吗
This is how you repay me?

434
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,940
工作复杂
It's very complex.

435
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,550
他已经很尽力了
He's trying very hard.

436
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,680
让他跪下
On his knees.

437
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,040
你当我傻吗
You think I'm a fool?

438
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,020
我会问出真相的
I'll get the truth.

439
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,390
我们都在工作
We're both working.

440
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,450
张开嘴
Open your mouth.

441
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,920
他要什么
What does he want?

442
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,450
你当我傻吗
You think I'm a fool?

443
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,990
究竟怎么回事
What's going on?

444
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,210
告诉我实话
Tell me the truth.

445
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,800
他在给你做耶利哥
He's building your Jericho.

446
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,870
你要什么  完成日期吗

我不参加问答的
I'm not part of the press conference,

529

都已经找过我们了
by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

537
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:16,890
我们是独立部门  目标更明确专一
We're a separate division with a more specific focus.

538
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,190
我们需要询问斯塔克先生
We need to debrief Mr Stark

539
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,850
关于他逃脱的具体情况
about the circumstances of his escape.

这样你们都能看到我  我也能...
That way you can see me, and I can...

544
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,720
这样不那么正式
A little less formal and...

545
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:44,950
-怎么变成嬉皮士聚会了  -别问我
- What's up with the love-in? - Don't look at me.

546

他是否有过挣扎  有过怀疑
If he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts.

553
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,030
或许他就完全是
Or maybe he was every inch

554
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,640
新闻纪录片里的那个男人
the man we all remember from the newsreels.

555
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:19,510
我看到了年轻的美国人被杀
I saw young Americans killed

556
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:24,530
杀害他们的正是我为了维护他们而制造的武器
by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them.

557
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:27,260
我还看到

我开了眼界  我意识到我可以为

这世界做更多  而不只是制造爆炸
to offer this world than just making things that blow up.

564
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,480
因此  即刻生效  我要关闭

00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,620
一致的走向
for this country, as well.

572
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,040
我们应该记住的
What we should take away from this

573
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,370

那...挺顺利嘛
Well, that... That went well.

579
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,430
我是在脑后放了个靶子吗
Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?

580
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,850
你的脑袋  那我的脑袋呢
Your head? What about my head?

581
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,410
你觉得明天股价
What do you think the over-under on the stock

582
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,030
会跌到什么程度
drop is gonna be tomorrow?

583
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,170
-乐观估计  40点  -至少
- Optimistically, 40 points. - At minimum.

这是我们的工作
That's what we do.

588
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,670
我们是铁商  我们制造武器
We're iron mongers. We make weapons.

589

大楼上是我的名字

590
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:04,500
我们的工作让世界不会陷入混乱
And what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.

591
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:05,960
我看到的可不是这样
Not based on what I saw.

592
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,630
我们做得不够好
We're not doing a good enough job.

我们可以做得更好  我们要做别的
We can do better. We're gonna do something else.

00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:13,090
什么别的  你要我们做奶瓶吗
Like what? You want us to make baby bottles?

595
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:17,330
我认为我们该重新考虑方舟反应堆科技
I think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.

596
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:21,840
得了  方舟反应堆就是个噱头
Come on. The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

597
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:22,740
托尼  拜托
Tony, come on.

598
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,160
我们建这个是为了堵嬉皮士的嘴
We built that thing to shut the hippies up!

599
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:28,870
-成功了  -是啊  作为科学项目
- It works. - Yeah, as a science project.

600
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,300
方舟反应堆的效益性根本不好
The arc was never cost effective.

601
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,220
我们建造之前就知道了
We knew that before we built it.

602
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:35,440
方舟反应堆科技是个死胡同  是吧
Arc reactor technology, that's a dead end, right?

603
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:36,490
或许吧
Maybe.

604
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,880
是吧  我们在这方面多久没有突破了
Am I right? We haven't had a breakthrough in that in what?

605
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,660
-30年吗  -据说是的
- Thirty years. - That's what they say.

606
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:47,200
你的扑克脸能更糟点吗  告诉我  谁说的
Could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?

607
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:50,450
-别管了  给我看  -罗德还是派珀
- Never mind who told me. Show me. - It's Rhodey or Pepper.

608
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,450
-我要看  -好吧  是罗德
- I want to see it. - Okay, Rhodey.

609
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,040
-好吧  -行吗
- Okay. - Okay?

610
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:07,080
成功了
It works.

611
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,520
听我说  托尼  我们是一队的  懂吗
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team. Do you understand?

612
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:18,770
只要我们合力  没什么是做不到的
There's nothing we can't do if we stick together,

613
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,400
就像当年我和你父亲
like your father and I.

614
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:22,440
抱歉我没提前跟你商量
I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads-up, okay?

615
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:23,780
-但如果我说了  -托尼
- But if I had... - Tony.

616
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:27,200
托尼  别再干这种脱口而出的事了
Tony, no more of this "ready, fire, aim" business.

617
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:29,070
-明白吗  -那是老爸常说的话
- You understand me? - That was Dad's line.

618
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,690
你得让我来处理
You gotta let me handle this.

619
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,060
我们现在得玩另一套把戏了
We're gonna have to play a whole different kind of ball now.

620
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:37,110
我们要承受很大压力
We're going to have to take a lot of heat.

621
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,580
我要你保证  你会低调些
I want you to promise me that you're gonna lay low.

622
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:42,430
斯塔克工业
Stark lndustries!

623
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,590
我给你推荐条路  准备好了吗
I've got one recommendation! Ready? Ready?

624
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:46,730
卖卖卖
Sell, sell, sell!

625
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,980
弃船
Abandon ship!

626
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:52,450
兴登堡飞艇的事记得吗
Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?

627
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,620
我给大家看看
Let me show you

628
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:58,890
新斯塔克工业的商业计划
the new Stark lndustries business plan!

629
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:04,180
这就是一家不造武器的武器公司
Look, that's a weapons company that doesn't make weapons!

630
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,550
派珀  你的手有多大
Pepper. How big are your hands?

631
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:10,080
-什么  -你的手有多大
- What? - How big are your hands?

632
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:13,130
-我不懂这...  -下来  我需要你
- I don't understand why... - Get down here. I need you.

633
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,970
伸出来  给我看看你的手
Let's see them. Show me your hands.

634
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,120
给我看看
Let's see them.

635
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:30,040
好小  好精巧
They are small. Very petite, indeed.

636
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,870
我需要你帮个忙
I just need your help for a sec.

637
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,200
天呐  那就是维系你生命的东西吗
Oh, my God, is that the thing that's keeping you alive?

638
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:39,400
之前是  现在是古董了
It was. It is now an antique.

639
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,420
这个将在未来一段时间内维系我的生命
This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future.

640
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:43,950
我要换升级版的
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,

641
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,000
现在遭遇了点障碍
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

642
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:48,740
障碍  什么意思
Speed bump, what does that mean?

643
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:49,880
没事  就是个小问题
It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

644
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:53,560
这个装置下面有条暴露的电线
There's an exposed wire under this device.

645
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,040
接触到了槽壁
And it's contacting the socket wall

646
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:56,680
造成了短路
and causing a little bit of a short.

647
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:58,960
没事的
It's fine.

648
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,900
-你要我做什么  -放在那边桌上
- What do you want me to do? - Put that on the table over there.

649
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:03,220
-那个没用了  -天呐
- That is irrelevant. - Oh, my God!

650
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:04,680
你伸手进去
I want you to reach in,

651
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:07,050
轻轻地把电线拉出来
and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out.

652
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,360
-安全吗  -应该没事
- Is it safe? - Yeah, it should be fine.

653
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:11,770
就像手术游戏  别让电线
It's like Operation. You just don't let it

654
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:14,030
碰到槽壁就行  否则就会发出哔声
touch the socket wall or it goes "beep."

655
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:14,860
什么"手术游戏"
What do you mean, "Operation"?

656
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,200
就是个游戏  算了
It's just a game, never mind.

657
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:18,530
-轻轻地把电线拉出来  -好
- Just gently lift the wire. - Okay.

658
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:20,420
好吗  很好
Okay? Great.

659
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,690
我觉得我做这个不够格
You know, I don't think that I'm qualified to do this.

660
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:28,700
你可以的  你是我认识的最够格
No, you're fine. You're the most capable, qualified,

661
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:32,270
最值得信赖的人  你会做得很棒的
trustworthy person I've ever met. You're gonna do great.

662
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:35,510
这个要求太过分了吗  因为我
Is it too much of a problem to ask? 'Cause I'm...

663
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,570
-好吧  -我真的需要你帮忙
- Okay, okay. - I really need your help here.

664
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:39,440
好了
Okay.

665
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:45,470
有脓液
Oh, there's pus!

666
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,420
不是脓液
It's not pus.

667
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:50,090
是装置释放出的无机原生质
It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device,

668
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,290
-不是我身体分泌的  -好臭
- not from my body. - It smells!

669
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,450
是啊
Yeah, it does.

670
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:56,510
铜线  铜线  摸到了吗
The copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?

671
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,000
-好  摸到了  -摸到了吗
- Okay, I got it! I got it! - Okay, you got it?

672
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,900
拉出来时不要碰到槽壁
Now, don't let it touch the sides when you're coming out!

673
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:03,160
-我之前就是跟你强调这个  -抱歉
- That's what I was trying to tell you before. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

674
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:05,610
拉出来时  一定不要拉出...
Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, you don't...

675
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,070
最末端的磁铁
There's a magnet at the end of it!

676
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,800
就这个  你给拉出来了
That was it. You just pulled it out.

677
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:10,160
-天呐  -我没想到...
- Oh, God! - Okay, I was not expecting...

678
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:12,010
-别放回去  -我怎么办
- Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in! - Okay, what do I do?

679
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:13,280
怎么了
What's wrong?

680
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:14,850
没事  我就是要心脏骤停了
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest

681
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:15,930
-因为你像捞鱼一样  -什么
- 'cause you yanked - What?

682
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:17,660
-把它揪出来了  -你不是说挺安全的吗
- it out like a trout... - I though you said it was safe!

683
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:18,900
我们得快了  拿这个
We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

684
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:21,570
-迅速换好  -好
- You gotta switch it out really quick. - Okay. Okay.

685
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,470
-托尼  -什么
- Tony? - What?

686
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,690
-会没事的  -是吗
- It's going to be okay. - Is it?

687
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,680
不会有事的
It's gonna be okay.

688
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:26,880
-我会搞定的  -希望如此
- I'm gonna make this okay. - Let's hope.

689
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,060
把那个接到底盘上
Okay, you're gonna attach that to the base plate.

690
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,990
务必要
Make sure you...

691
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:36,860
很难吗
Was that so hard?

692
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,190
挺好玩的吧
That was fun, right?

693
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,970
好了  给我吧
Here, I got it. I got it. Here.

694
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:41,700
好样的
Nice.

695
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:44,940
-你没事吧  -嗯  我很好  你没事吧
- Are you okay? - Yeah, I feel great. You okay?

696
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,700
永远永远永远
Don't ever, ever, ever,

697
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:52,770
别再要求我做这样的事了
ever ask me to do anything like that ever again.

698
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,800
我只有你
I don't have anyone but you.

699
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,470
好了
Anyway...

700
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,660
-这个你要我怎么处理  -那个吗
- What do you want me to do with this? - That?

701
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,110
毁掉
Destroy it.

702
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,120
焚毁
Incinerate it.

703
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:16,490
你不想留着吗
You don't want to keep it?

704
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,390
派珀  人们说我有很多特点
Pepper, I've been called many things.

705
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,170
但不包括"怀旧"
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

706
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:22,950
没别的事了吧  斯塔克先生
Will that be all, Mr Stark?

707
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,550
没事了  波茨小姐
That will be all, Miss Potts.

708
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,490
笨手笨脚  过来
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

709
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,710
我桌上这堆东西怎么回事
What's all this stuff doing on top of my desk?

710
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,950
那是我的手机  那是我跟爸爸的合照
That's my phone, that's a picture of me and my dad.

711
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,880
那里  垃圾堆里
Right there. In the garbage. All that stuff.

712
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:46,790
空中战斗的未来  是有人还是无人
The future of air combat. Is it manned or unmanned?

713
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,000
以我的经验
I'll tell you, in my experience,

714
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:51,170
无人机永远
no unmanned aerial vehicle

715
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:54,130
比不过飞行员的直觉
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

716
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,580
见解
his insight,

717
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:58,350
以及看透表象
that ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious

718
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:02,270
确定结果的判断力
and discern its outcome, or a pilot's judgement.

719
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:05,290
中校  何不让飞行员摆脱飞机
Colonel? Why not a pilot without the plane?

720
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,530
看看是谁从天而降  托尼·斯塔克先生
Look who fell out of the sky. Mr Tony Stark.

721
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:09,300
-你好  先生  -说到有人无人[是不是男人]
- Hello, sir. - Speaking of manned or unmanned,

722
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:09,950
你们一定要问他
you gotta get him to tell you

723
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:11,700
有年春假猜错答案的那次
about the time he guessed wrong at spring break.

724
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,060
记住  春假  1987年
Just remember that, spring break, 1987.

725
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,320
-跟你一起醒来的那位美丽女士  -别闹
- That lovely lady you woke up with. - Don't do that!

726
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,920
-他叫什么来着  -别闹
- What was his name? - Don't do that.

727
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,070
-埃文吗  -别闹
- Was it Ivan? - Don't do that.

728
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,390
他们会信的  别闹
They'll believe it. Don't do that.

729
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:20,580
-好吧  -别闹
- Okay. - Don't do that.

730
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:23,440
-认识你们很高兴  -让我们聊会儿
- Pleasure meeting you. - Give us a couple minutes, you guys.

731
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:28,240
-我很意外  -为什么
- I'm surprised. - Why?

732
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,130
我没想到这么快就能见到你起来走动
I swear, I didn't expect to see you walking around so soon.

733
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:32,950
我可不止是走动
I'm doing a little better than walking.

734
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:34,340
-真的  -嗯
- Really? - Yeah.

735
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,930
罗德  我在研究个大项目
Rhodey, I'm working on something big.

736
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:40,920
我是来找你的  我希望你也参与进来

What? You're a humanitarian now or something?

743
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,610
-我需要你听我说  -不
- I need you to listen to me. - No.

744
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:02,710
你需要时间把思绪理清楚
What you need is time to get your mind right.

745

其实  我不知道现在能信任谁
Actually, I don't know who to trust right now.

753

我不希望这玩意落入坏人之手

00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:43,880
看看10%的推进能量能否实现上升

你不是说你不做武器了吗
I thought you said you were done making weapons.

783
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:41,780

784
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:45,810
这是飞行稳定器  完全无害
This is a flight stabiliser. It's completely harmless.

785

这我没料到
I didn't expect that.

786
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,460
怎么样
How'd it go?

787
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:01,820
那么不顺利啊
It went that bad, huh?

788
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,510
就因为我从纽约带了披萨回来
Just because I brought pizza back from New York

789
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:06,170
不代表就不顺利
doesn't mean it went bad.

00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:08,500
当然了  天呐
Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

791

如果你去了还能顺利点
It would have gone better if you were there.

792

我低调  你处理好...
I lay low, and you take care of all...

801
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,350
我们早知道会这样
We knew that was gonna happen.

802
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:34,600
-是56.5  -这无所谓

我们拥有公司的控股权
We own the controlling interest in the company.

804
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:40,340
托尼  董事会也有权利
Tony, the board has rights, too.

805
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:44,500
他们称  你和你的新方向
They're making the case that you and your new direction

806
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,840
-对公司不是最有利的  -我这是负责任
- isn't in the company's best interest. - I'm being responsible!

807
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,660
这是我和公司的新方向
That's a new direction for me, for the company.

808
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,470
我要代表公司
I mean, me on the company's behalf

809

我在努力挽回局面
I'm trying to turn this thing around,

别拿那玩意时刻指着我
Please don't follow me around with it, either,

835
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:04,290
让我觉得我随时会自燃

860
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:14,790
先生  真正飞行之前
Sir, there are still terabytes

861
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:17,570
还需要进行兆兆字节的计算
of calculations needed before an actual flight is...

862
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:21,520
贾维斯  有时候要先跑才能走

866
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:22,140
SR-71侦察机的记录是多少
What's SR-71's record?

867
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:26,050
固定翼飞行的飞行高度记录为8.5万英尺
The altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.

868
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:28,460
记录就是用来打破的  来啊
Records are made to be broken! Come on!

869
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:35,430
先生  出现了可能致命的结冰
Sir, there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring.

870
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:37,160
继续走
Come on!

871
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:40,310
再高点
Higher!

872
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,790

878
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:07,910
记录  主传感器在4万英尺以上变得迟缓

观察敏锐  先生
A very astute observation, sir.

882
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,460
或许  如果您打算造访其他星球
Perhaps, if you intend to visit other planets,

883
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:18,110
我们应该改进排气系统

我不知道能说什么
I don't know what to tell you.

1004
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,780
我真的差点相信了
I actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker.

1005
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:22,890
我出门了几个月  没听说吗
I was out of town for a couple months, in case you didn't hear.

1006

这就是你所谓的负责任吗

我曾经很天真
You know what? I was naive before,

1016
01:12:56,230 --> 01:12:57,950
他们说  "这条线  我们不要越过

01:12:57,950 --> 01:12:59,590
我们就这么做生意"

1022
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:16,140
托尼  你以为是谁排挤了你

是我提出了针对你的禁止令

Now, what am I supposed to tell the press?

1171
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,900
演练  一般不都用这套屁话吗
Training exercise. Isn't that the usual BS?

1172

it is still unclear who or what intervened,

1178

温柔点  这是我第一次

承认吧

这不是你撞见我做的最糟糕的事

1193
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:15,960
也不会把脸烧掉了

这只是首次的粗糙的尝试

1204

我们有共同的敌人

在世界的这一带一直是个致命弱点

这是你最不需要担心的事了

把装甲和其余的装箱带走

马上给我造个原型机

你忙吗  可以替我去办件事吗

1223
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,720
我需要你去我办公室
I need you to go to my office.

1224
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:43,580

1229
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:52,800
要不  就是在幽灵驱动上
If not, they put it on a ghost drive,

1230
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,420
那样的话  你就得查找标题数码最小的
in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading.

1231
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:58,170
如果我拿回了信息

1232
01:28:58,170 --> 01:28:59,040

你知道我愿帮你做任何事

但如果你又要这么胡来  我就不能帮你
but I cannot help you if you're going to start all of this again.

1239
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:19,550
除了这个  别无其他  没有艺术馆开幕

1240
01:29:19,550 --> 01:29:22,990
或是慈善晚会  或是签什么字

1241
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:27,290
只有下一项任务  没有别的

是吗
Is that so?

这么多年来  你一直在我身边
You stood by my side all these years

1245

现在我想保护那些
And now that I'm trying to protect the people

1247
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:44,920
因我而身陷危险的人  你却要走人吗
that I put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?

1248
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:46,920
你会害死自己的  托尼
You're going to kill yourself, Tony.

1249

我不要助你一臂之力

我本不该活下来的

1251
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,410

01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:20,250
托尼其实根本没有回家来  是吧
well, Tony never really did come home, did he?

1277
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:24,640
他把自己的一部分留在了那个洞里

01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:10,620
呼吸
Breathe.

1319
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:14,470
放松
Easy, easy.

1320
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,790
你记得这个吧
You remember this one, right?

1321
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:22,510
真可惜政府没批准
It's a shame the government didn't approve it.

1322
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:26,790
诱发短暂麻痹用途多广泛啊
There's so many applications for causing short-term paralysis.

1323
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,300
托尼
Tony.

1324
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:37,440
我找人杀你时
When I ordered the hit on you,

1325
01:36:39,870 --> 01:36:42,310
我还担心
I worried that I was

1326
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:47,610
我是杀了金鹅
killing the golden goose.

1327
01:36:48,790 --> 01:36:50,130
但是
But, you see,

1328
01:36:51,310 --> 01:36:52,500
那真是
it was just

1329
01:36:53,830 --> 01:36:56,350
命运  你偏偏活了下来
fate that you survived that.

1330
01:37:01,210 --> 01:37:05,560
你还要给出最后一枚金蛋
You had one last golden egg to give.

1331
01:37:09,330 --> 01:37:10,690
你真以为
Do you really think

1332
01:37:10,690 --> 01:37:14,850
你想了个点子  它就是你的了吗
that just because you have an idea, it belongs to you?

1333
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:19,510
你父亲
Your father,

1334
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:23,660
他帮忙造了原子弹
he helped give us the atomic bomb.

1335
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:25,620
如果他像你这么自私
Now, what kind of world would it be today

1336
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:27,880
现在的世界会是什么样啊
if he was as selfish as you?

1337
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,910
真是美丽
Oh, it's beautiful.

1338
01:37:42,630 --> 01:37:47,400
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}西方迷信
贝多芬创作完成第九交响乐后不久便离世
他之后的很多作曲家也都是如此

1339
01:37:42,630 --> 01:37:47,400
托尼  这是你的第九交响乐
Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony.

1340
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:51,630
真是杰作  看啊
What a masterpiece. Look at that.

1341
01:37:53,110 --> 01:37:54,630
这是你的遗产
This is your legacy.

1342
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:59,700
新一代的武器
A new generation of weapons

1343
01:38:00,850 --> 01:38:02,920
将有它作为心脏
with this at its heart.

1344
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:09,680
这些武器会把世界拉回正轨
Weapons that will help steer the world back on course,

1345
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:12,060
让权力落在我们手中
put the balance of power in our hands.

1346
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:14,910
合适的手中
The right hands.

1347
01:38:18,290 --> 01:38:23,230
真希望你能看到我的原型机
I wish you could see my prototype.

1348
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:25,490
虽然不像
It's not as...

1349
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:30,160
不像你的那个那么保守
Well, not as conservative as yours.

1350
01:38:32,050 --> 01:38:34,670
可惜你还把派珀卷了进来
Too bad you had to involve Pepper in this.

1351
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,520
我本来更想留她一命的
I would have preferred that she lived.

1352
01:38:50,950 --> 01:38:53,280
什么意思  他花钱雇人去杀托尼
What do you mean, he paid to have Tony killed?

1353
01:38:53,290 --> 01:38:55,910
派珀  慢点说  奥巴代亚为什么要
Pepper, slow down. Why would Obadiah...

1354
01:38:57,230 --> 01:38:58,530
好吧  托尼现在在哪
Okay, where's Tony now?

1355
01:38:58,530 --> 01:39:00,300
我不知道  他不接电话
I don't know. He's not answering his phone.

1356
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:02,600
请你过去一趟  确保他没事
Please go over there and make sure everything's okay.

1357
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:05,500
谢谢  罗德  我知道条近路
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.

1358

乖
Good boy.

1359
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:53,570
托尼
Tony?

1360
01:40:56,390 --> 01:40:57,410
托尼
Tony!

1361

托尼
Tony!

托尼
Tony!

托尼
Tony!

1364
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:11,830
托尼  你没事吧
Tony! You okay?

1365
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:13,260
派珀呢
Where's Pepper?

1366
01:41:14,070 --> 01:41:15,970
她没事  她身边有五个特工呢
She's fine. She's with five agents.

1367
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:17,530
他们要去逮捕奥巴代亚了
They're about to arrest Obadiah.

1368
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:19,790
那不够
That's not going to be enough.

1369
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:45,870
16区
Section 16.

1370
01:41:47,110 --> 01:41:48,720
16区
Section 16.

1371
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:50,620
在那儿呢
There it is.

1372
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:01,570
我的钥匙没用  打不开门
My key's not working. It's not opening the door.

1373
01:42:02,770 --> 01:42:04,200
那是什么  小装置吗
What's that? It's, like, a little device?

1374
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:05,980
能开锁吗
It's, like, a thing that's going to pick the lock?

1375
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:07,570
你最好退后几步
You might want to take a few steps back.

1376
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:29,790
那真是我见过的最酷的东西
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

1377
01:42:29,790 --> 01:42:30,960
不赖吧
Not bad, huh?

1378
01:42:31,970 --> 01:42:32,840
我们来吧
Let's do it.

1379
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:41,250
还需要我做什么吗
You need me to do anything else?

1380
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:43,710
别让人上天搅局
Keep the skies clear.

1381
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:50,220
我去
Damn!

1382
01:42:58,490 --> 01:42:59,920
下次吧  宝贝
Next time, baby.

1383
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:33,810
看来你是对的  他是在造战衣
Looks like you were right. He was building a suit.

1384
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:35,760
我以为会更大些呢
I thought it'd be bigger.

1385
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:22,250
干掉他
Take him out!

1386
01:44:32,970 --> 01:44:35,210
你觉得马克1号的胸膛电源能不能撑得住
How do you think the Mark I chest piece is going to hold up?

1387
01:44:35,210 --> 01:44:37,470
战衣电力为48%  还在减少  先生
The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.

1388
01:44:37,470 --> 01:44:40,470
这块胸膛电源不是设计用来飞行的
That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight.

1389
01:44:40,470 --> 01:44:41,390
随时通知我情况
Keep me posted.

1390
01:44:43,650 --> 01:44:44,530
派珀
Pepper!

1391
01:44:44,530 --> 01:44:46,400
托尼  你没事吧
Tony! Tony, are you okay?

1392
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:47,560
我没事  你怎么...
I'm fine. How are...

1393
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:49,680
-奥巴代亚  他疯了  -我知道
- Obadiah, he's gone insane! - I know.

1394
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:51,500
-你最好赶紧走  -他建了套战衣
- Listen, you'd better get out of there. - He built a suit.

1395
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:52,970
快点  马上走
Get out of there right now!

1396
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:06,590
你想去哪
Where do you think you're going?

1397
01:45:12,690 --> 01:45:15,400
我不再需要你的服务了
Your services are no longer required.

1398
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:17,560
斯坦尼
Stane!

1399
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:44,420
我爱这套战衣
I love this suit!

1400
01:45:44,420 --> 01:45:47,780
-把他们放下  -附带伤害  托尼
- Put them down! - Collateral damage, Tony.

1401
01:45:49,150 --> 01:45:50,780
向胸膛转移能量
Divert power to chest RT.

1402
01:46:00,170 --> 01:46:02,120
能量仅剩19%
Power reduced to 19%.

1403
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:10,960
女士
Lady!

1404
01:46:12,940 --> 01:46:14,730
不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1405
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:40,020
30年了  我一直捧着你
For 30 years, I've been holding you up!

1406
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:46,770
我从零建立起了这家公司
I built this company from nothing!

1407
01:46:49,090 --> 01:46:51,650
什么都别想妨碍我
Nothing is going to stand in my way.

1408
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:00,730
你更别想
Least of all you!

1409
01:47:09,890 --> 01:47:13,610
厉害  你升级了你的盔甲
Impressive! You've upgraded your armour!

1410
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:16,130
我自己也有升级
I've made some upgrades of my own!

1411
01:47:24,810 --> 01:47:26,850
先生  他的战衣似乎能飞
Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.

1412
01:47:26,850 --> 01:47:28,720
发现了  带我飞到最高高度
Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.

1413
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:30,120
现在只有15%的电力
With only 15% power,

1414
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:31,050
达到这高度的可能性
the odds of reaching that...

1415
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:33,090
我会算算数  照做
I know the math! Do it!

1416
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:43,850
长官  你不会相信的  那玩意回来了
Sir, you're not going to believe this. That thing is back.

1417
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:46,030
接艾伦少校  集结飞机
Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!

1418
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:52,260
不必了  各位  只是演练
Not necessary, people. Just a training exercise.

1419
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:53,470
是  长官
Yes, sir.

1420
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:02,850
只剩13%的电力了  先生
Thirteen percent power, sir.

1421
01:48:02,850 --> 01:48:03,670
继续爬升
Climb!

1422
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:09,490
-11%  -继续飞
- Eleven percent. - Keep going!

1423
01:48:16,220 --> 01:48:18,350
-电力为7%  -在屏幕上显示就行
- Seven percent power. - Just leave it on the screen!

1424
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:19,380
别说了
Stop telling me!

1425
01:48:29,710 --> 01:48:31,290
你的点子很棒  托尼
You had a great idea, Tony,

1426
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:34,190
但我的战衣在各方面都更先进
but my suit is more advanced in every way!

1427
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,560
你怎么解决结冰问题的
How'd you solve the icing problem?

1428
01:48:36,950 --> 01:48:38,270
什么结冰问题
Icing problem?

1429
01:48:40,690 --> 01:48:42,130
最好查看一下
Might want to look into it.

1430
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:55,780
2%
Two percent.

1431
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:00,730
现在在使用紧急备用电力
We are now running on emergency backup power.

1432
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:16,210
-波茨  -托尼  天呐  你没事吧
- Potts! - Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

1433
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:17,550
我快没电了
I'm almost out of power.

1434
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:19,860
我得脱掉战衣  我就过去
I've got to get out of this thing. I'll be right there.

1435
01:49:20,390 --> 01:49:21,650
想得美
Nice try!

1436
01:49:34,710 --> 01:49:36,270
武器状态
Weapons status?

1437
01:49:36,460 --> 01:49:39,000
冲击系统下线  导弹下线
Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.

1438
01:49:42,910 --> 01:49:43,910
燃烧弹
Flares!

1439
01:49:52,870 --> 01:49:55,090
真聪明  托尼
Very clever, Tony.

1440
01:50:00,290 --> 01:50:02,830
-波茨  -托尼
- Potts? - Tony!

1441
01:50:02,830 --> 01:50:03,410
这样不行
This isn't working.

1442
01:50:03,410 --> 01:50:06,040
我们得过载反应堆  炸碎屋顶
We're going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.

1443
01:50:06,290 --> 01:50:09,180
-你要怎么做到  -你来做
- Well, how are you going to do that? - You're going to do it.

1444
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:11,720
去中央控制台  打开所有电路
Go to the central console, open up all the circuits.

1445
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:13,020
等我撤离了屋顶  就告诉你
When I get clear of the roof, I'll let you know.

1446
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:15,420
你就按下主旁路按钮
You're going to hit the master bypass button.

1447
01:50:16,010 --> 01:50:17,670
上面的一切都会被烧毁
It's going to fry everything up here.

1448
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:21,840
好  我这就进去
Okay. I'm going in now.

1449
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:24,990
一定等我离开屋顶的  我给你争取点时间
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I'll buy you some time.

1450
01:50:34,650 --> 01:50:36,100
这个看上去挺重要
This looks important!

1451
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:59,870
我一向不怎么喜欢这种玩意
I never had a taste for this sort of thing,

1452
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:04,570
但我得承认  我非常喜欢这件战衣
but I must admit, I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

1453
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:15,120
你可算超常发挥了  托尼
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

1454
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:19,700
你会让你父亲自豪的
You'd have made your father proud!

1455
01:51:24,650 --> 01:51:26,740
准备好了  托尼  快离开屋顶
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

1456
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:48,130
托尼
Tony!

1457
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:50,950
真是讽刺  托尼
How ironic, Tony!

1458
01:51:52,730 --> 01:51:54,830
你想让世界上不再有武器
Trying to rid the world of weapons,

1459
01:51:55,430 --> 01:51:57,650
却发明了最棒的武器
you gave it its best one ever!

1460
01:51:57,650 --> 01:51:59,970
-派珀  -现在
- Pepper! - And now

1461
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:03,500
我要拿它杀了你
I'm going to kill you with it!

1462
01:52:06,730 --> 01:52:10,720
-你扯掉了我的瞄准系统  -按按钮
- You ripped out my targeting system! - Time to hit the button!

1463
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:14,730
-你叫我别按的  -别动  你个小混蛋
- You told me not to! - Hold still, you little prick!

1464
01:52:16,590 --> 01:52:19,540
-动手吧  -你会死的
- Just do it! - You'll die!

1465
01:52:22,390 --> 01:52:23,740
按吧
Push it!

1466
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:22,790
托尼
Tony!

1467
01:53:31,410 --> 01:53:33,360
各位都拿到了昨晚斯塔克工业
You've all received the official statement of

1468
01:53:31,490 --> 01:53:43,210
{\an8}詹姆斯·罗德中校  斯塔克工业事件

1469
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:35,850
事件经过的官方报告
what occurred at Stark lndustries last night.

1470
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:38,140
有未经证实的报告称
There have been unconfirmed reports

1471
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:40,960
一件机器人原型机发生故障
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned

1472
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,630
导致方舟反应堆受损
and caused damage to the arc reactor.

1473
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:46,680
幸好  托尼·斯塔克的一位私人保镖
Fortunately, a member of Tony Stark's personal security staff...

1474
01:53:44,420 --> 01:53:47,290
{\an8}钢铁侠是谁

1475
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:48,630
"钢铁侠"  挺上口  挺响亮的
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it.

1476
01:53:48,630 --> 01:53:49,980
虽然并不准确
I mean, it's not technically accurate.

1477
01:53:49,980 --> 01:53:52,360
战衣是金钛合金
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

1478
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:55,150
但这种意向呼之欲出
but it's kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway.

1479
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:56,340
这是你的不在场证明
Here's your alibi.

1480
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:58,750
好
Okay.

1481
01:53:58,830 --> 01:54:01,060
-你在你的游艇上  -嗯
- You were on your yacht. - Yeah.

1482
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:03,250
我们有港口报告证明你整晚都在阿瓦隆
We have port papers that put you in Avalon all night,

1483
01:54:03,250 --> 01:54:05,190
还有你50位宾客的宣誓证词
and sworn statements from 50 of your guests.

1484
01:54:05,190 --> 01:54:08,250
或许该说只有我和派珀
See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me

1485
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:10,130
单独在岛上
alone on the island.

1486
01:54:11,390 --> 01:54:12,740
-就是这样的  -好吧
- That's what happened. - All right.

1487
01:54:12,740 --> 01:54:14,310
照读就行
Just read it, word for word.

1488
01:54:16,790 --> 01:54:18,240
上面没提斯坦尼
There's nothing about Stane here.

1489
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:21,900
这已经处理好了  他去度假了
That's being handled. He's on vacation.

1490
01:54:22,450 --> 01:54:24,990
小型飞机的安全记录很差
Small aircraft have such a poor safety record.

1491
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,680
但关于保镖的那套掩护说辞呢
But what about the whole cover story that it's a bodyguard?

1492
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:28,930
他是我的...这...
He's my... I mean, is that...

1493
01:54:28,930 --> 01:54:30,490
这太站不住脚了吧
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

1494
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:32,690
我不是第一次做这种事了  斯塔克先生
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr Stark.

1495
01:54:33,010 --> 01:54:34,170
按官方说辞念就行
Just stick to the official statement,

1496
01:54:34,170 --> 01:54:36,190
很快  这一切都会过去了
and soon, this will all be behind you.

1497
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:39,590
你有90秒
You've got 90 seconds.

1498
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:43,330
科尔森特工
Agent Coulson?

1499
01:54:44,590 --> 01:54:48,830
我想说  非常感谢你的一切帮助
I just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help.

1500
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:52,170
这是我们的职责  我们还会再联系的
That's what we do. You'll be hearing from us.

1501
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:55,560
-你们叫国土战略  -喊我们神盾局就行
- From the Strategic Homeland... - Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1502
01:54:56,170 --> 01:54:57,130
好
Right.

1503
01:54:58,270 --> 01:54:59,890
我们开始吧
Let's get this show on the road.

1504
01:54:59,890 --> 01:55:02,110
其实也没那么糟
You know, it's actually not that bad.

1505
01:55:02,110 --> 01:55:03,810
就连我都不觉得自己像钢铁侠
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

1506
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:06,240
-你不是钢铁侠  -我是
- You're not Iron Man. - Am so.

1507
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:08,270
-你不是  -好吧  随你
- You're not. - All right, suit yourself.

1508
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:10,260
如果我是钢铁侠
You know, if I were Iron Man,

1509
01:55:10,260 --> 01:55:12,700
我会有个知道我真实身份的女友
I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

1510
01:55:12,700 --> 01:55:13,540
而且她会很崩溃
She'd be a wreck,

1511
01:55:13,540 --> 01:55:15,280
因为她会非常担心我会不会送命
'cause she'd always be worrying that I was going to die,

1512
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:17,870
但又为我的成就感到骄傲
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

1513
01:55:17,870 --> 01:55:22,390
她会非常矛盾  而这又让她更加
She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more

1514
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,450
为我疯狂了
crazy about me.

1515
01:55:24,450 --> 01:55:26,230
你难道就没想过那晚的事吗
Tell me you never think about that night.

1516
01:55:26,250 --> 01:55:27,790
-哪一晚  -你知道的
- What night? - You know.

1517
01:55:31,070 --> 01:55:32,240
你是说
Are you talking about

1518
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:34,270
我们一起跳舞的那晚吗
the night that we danced

1519
01:55:34,270 --> 01:55:36,750
然后我们上了屋顶
and went up on the roof,

1520
01:55:38,430 --> 01:55:39,650
然后
and then

1521
01:55:40,870 --> 01:55:44,120
你去楼下拿酒
you went downstairs to get me a drink,

1522
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:47,840
然后就撇下了我一人
and you left me there, by myself?

1523
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:50,340
你是说那晚吗
Is that the night you're talking about?

1524
01:55:53,390 --> 01:55:54,520
我猜也是
Thought so.

1525
01:55:57,110 --> 01:55:58,010
没有别的事了吧  斯塔克先生
Will that be all, Mr Stark?

1526
01:55:58,010 --> 01:56:00,970
是的  没别的事了  波茨小姐
Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1527
01:56:00,970 --> 01:56:04,570
现在  斯塔克先生准备了一份声明
And now, Mr Stark has prepared a statement.

1528
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:07,700
他不会接受提问的  谢谢
He will not be taking any questions. Thank you.

1529
01:56:11,820 --> 01:56:14,020
自我上次见大家过去好一阵了
Been a while since I was in front of you.

1530
01:56:14,020 --> 01:56:15,950
我这次还是照稿读吧
I figure I'll stick to the cards this time.

1531
01:56:18,890 --> 01:56:19,830
有人猜测
There's been speculation

1532
01:56:19,830 --> 01:56:21,910
我卷入了之前发生在
that I was involved in the events that occurred

1533
01:56:21,910 --> 01:56:23,180
高速和屋顶上的事件
on the freeway and the rooftop...

1534
01:56:23,180 --> 01:56:24,290
抱歉  斯塔克先生
I'm sorry, Mr Stark,

1535
01:56:24,290 --> 01:56:26,150
你真的指望我们相信
but do you honestly expect us to believe that

1536
01:56:26,150 --> 01:56:30,040
那是一个穿战衣的保镖  碰巧出现
that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared,

1537
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:32,820
-尽管你...  -我知道情况让人糊涂
- despite the fact that you... - I know that it's confusing.

1538
01:56:33,260 --> 01:56:35,900
质疑官方说辞是一回事
It is one thing to question the official story,

1539
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:38,240
但提出疯狂指控  或暗示说
and another thing entirely to make wild accusations,

1540
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:40,400
我是个超级英雄可是另一码事了
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

1541
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:42,080
我可没说你是超级英雄
I never said you were a superhero.

1542
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:43,640
是吗  那很好
Didn't? Well, good,

1543
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:47,800
因为那是不着边际  异想天开的
because that would be outlandish and fantastic.

1544
01:56:49,390 --> 01:56:53,040
我显然不是做英雄的料
I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.

1545
01:56:53,210 --> 01:56:56,310
我有一堆性格缺陷
With this laundry list of character defects,

1546
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:57,760
犯过那么多错误
all the mistakes I've made,

1547
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:01,240
-还很公开  -照稿读就行
- largely public. - Just stick to the cards, man.

1548
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:03,150
好  好
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1549
01:57:05,010 --> 01:57:06,090
事实就是
The truth is

1550
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:14,060
我就是钢铁侠
I am Iron Man.

1551
02:05:17,380 --> 02:05:18,470
贾维斯
Jarvis!

1552
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:20,680
欢迎回家  先生
Welcome home, sir.

1553
02:05:23,900 --> 02:05:25,990
"我就是钢铁侠"
"I am Iron Man."

1554
02:05:26,830 --> 02:05:29,560
你以为你是这世上唯一的超级英雄吗
You think you're the only superhero in the world?

1555
02:05:29,790 --> 02:05:30,500
斯塔克先生
Mr Stark,

1556
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:32,920
你已经成为了更大的宇宙的一部分
you've become part of a bigger universe.

1557
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:35,250
你只是现在还不知道
You just don't know it yet.

1558
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,540
你是谁
Who the hell are you?

1559
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:40,200
尼克·弗瑞  神盾局局长
Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1560
02:05:42,170 --> 02:05:44,800
我来跟你谈谈复仇者联盟
I'm here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative.
