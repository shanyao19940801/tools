00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,310
然后就完了
and that'll be it.

171
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,170
小派  我知道我说过再不制造意外了
Pep, I know I said no more surprises...

172
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,510
但我得说  我真的希望能完成这最后一个
but I gotta say I was really hoping to pull off one last one.

173
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,230
但是现在看来...
But it looks like...

174
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,570
你知道看起来如何
Well, you know what it looks like.

175
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,160
别为此而难过
Don't feel bad about this.

176
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,660
其实  如果你痛心难过个几周
I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks...

177
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,460
然后带着巨大的罪恶感继续生活下去...
and then move on with enormous guilt...

178
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,190
也许我应该躺会儿
I should probably lie down for a minute.

179
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,460
让眼睛休息一下
Go rest my eyes.

180
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,300
请知道
Please know...

181
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,220
当我渐渐睡去  会和近来的每晚一样
when I drift off, it'll be like every night lately.

182
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,230
我很好  真的很好
I'm fine. Totally fine.

183
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,770
我会梦到你
I dream about you.

184
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,690
因为一直都是你
Because it's always you.

185
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,740
没能阻止他
Couldn't stop him.

186
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,740
我也一样
Neither could I.

187
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,690
等等
Hang on.

188
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,820
我没救下那孩子
I lost the kid.

189
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,990
托尼  我们都输了
Tony, we lost.

190
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,320
派珀她...
Is, uh...?

191
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,200
-太好了  -天呐
- Oh, good. - Oh, my God!

192
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,160
天呐
Oh, my God!

193
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,630
没事了
It's okay.

194
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,260
距灭霸来到地球  已经过了23天
It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth.

195
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,100
世界各国政府分崩离析
World governments are in pieces.

196
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,190
仍在运转的部门
The parts that are still working...

197
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,730
在进行人口普查  看来他是成功了
...are trying to take a census and it looks like he did...

198
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,290
他做到了他声称要做的事
He did exactly what he said he was gonna do.

199
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,200
灭霸消灭了...
Thanos wiped out...

200
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,080
一半的生命
...50% of all living creatures.

201
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,460
他现在在哪
Where is he now? Where?

202
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,420
我们不知道
We don't know.

203
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,050
他开了个传送门  穿过去了
He just opened a portal and walked through.

204
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,010
他是哪根筋不对
What's wrong with him?

205
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,090
他很愤怒
Oh, he's pissed.

206
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,470
他觉得自己失败了
He thinks he failed.

207
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,030
没错  他是失败了
Which, of course, he did...

208
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,370
但我们都失败了  不是吗
but you know, there's a lot of that going around, ain't there?

209
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,200
说真的  要不是你开口说话
Honestly, until this exact second

210
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,490
我还以为你是小熊玩偶
I thought you were a Build-A-Bear.

211
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,160
没准我就是
Maybe I am.

212
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,290
我们已经找了灭霸三周
We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now.

213
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,370
扫描外太空
Deep space scans...

214
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,570
卫星搜索  然而毫无发现
and satellites, and we got nothing.

215
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,820
托尼  你和他交手过
Tony, you fought him.

216
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,820
谁跟你说的
Who told you that?

217
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,050
我没跟他"交手"
I didn't fight him.

218
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,090
他用一颗星球暴揍了我
No, he wiped my face with a planet...

219
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,590
然后那个布里克街魔术师把宝石交出去了
while the Bleecker Street magician gave away the store.

220
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,820
实情就是这样  根本谈不上交手
That's what happened. There was no fight,

221
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,010
-好吧  -他根本不可战胜
- Ok.  - 'cause he's not beatable.

222
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,290
他有没有透露过任何线索或坐标
Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?

223
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,480
我几年前就预料到了
I saw this coming a few years back.

224
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,380
我看到了幻象  我本来不想相信
I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it.

225
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,010
以为自己是做梦
Thought I was dreaming.

226
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,110
托尼  我需要你集中精神
Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.

227
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,970
我曾经也需要你
And I needed you.

228
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,450
我是指过去
As in, past tense.

229
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,850
那比你现在的需求重要  太迟了  哥们
That trumps what you need. It's too late, buddy.

230
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,180
抱歉
Sorry.

231
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,850
知道我需要什么吗  我需要刮胡子
You know what I need? I need a shave.

232
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,500
而且我记得我告诉过你们所有人
And I believe I remember telling all youse...

233
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,040
托尼  托尼
Tony, Tony!

234
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,480
还在和不在的  我们需要的
...alive and otherwise, that what we needed

235
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,760
是一套保护世界的战衣
was a suit of armor around the world.

236
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,420
记得吗
Remember that?

237
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,430
不管那是否会影响到我们宝贵的自由
Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not.

238
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,760
那才是我们曾需要的
That's what we needed.

239
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,890
但那并没成功  不是吗
Well, that didn't work out, did it?

240
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,460
我说过我们会输的
I said we'd lose.

241
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,290
而你说  "那就一起输"
You said, "We'll do that together, too."

242
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,540
你猜怎么着  队长
And guess what, Cap?

243
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,090
我们输了
We lost.

244
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,000
而你不在场
And you weren't there.

245
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,150
不过我们就是干这个的  不是吗
But that's what we do, right?

246
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,400
总是在事后行动  我们是"复仇者"
Our best work after the fact? We're the "Avengers."

247
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,320
"复仇者"  而不是"预防者"
We're the "Avengers," Not the "Pre-vengers."

248
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,200
-好了  -对吗
- Okay. - Right?

249
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,910
-你说得很明白了  先坐下吧  -好
- You made your point. Just sit down, okay? - Okay.

250
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,070
-不  我还没说完  -托尼
- No, no, here's my point. You know what? - Tony,

251
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,280
-对了  她可真棒  -你身体不好  坐下
- She's great by the way. - you're sick. Sit down.

252
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,080
我们需要你  你是新生力量
We need you. You're new blood.

253
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,160
一群身心疲惫的老家伙
Bunch of tired old mules.

254
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,460
我没什么可给你的  队长
I got nothing for you, Cap.

255
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,110
没坐标
I got no coordinates...

256
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,770
没线索  没战略  没选择
no clues, no strategies, no options.

257
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,360
屁都没有
Zero. Zip. Nada.

258
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,990
也没有信任  骗子
No trust, liar.

259
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,080
给你  拿着
Here, take this.

260
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,080
你找到他  戴上它
You find him, you put that on...

261
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,960
躲起来
you hide.

262
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,000
-托尼  -我没事
- Tony! - I'm fine.

263
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,460
让我...
Let me...

264
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,110
布鲁斯给他注射了镇静剂
Bruce gave him a sedative.

265
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,600
估计他今天之内都不会醒了
He's gonna probably be out for the rest of the day.

266
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,450
你们照顾好他
You guys take care of him...

267
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,520
我回来时给他捎点克佐利亚的神药
and I'll bring him a Xorrian elixir when I come back.

268
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,160
你要去哪
Where are you going?

269
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,770
去杀灭霸
To kill Thanos.

270
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,380
我们通常一起行动
You know, we usually work as a team here and, uh,

271
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,340
私下里说一句  现在士气有点低落
between you and I, morale's a little fragile.

272
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,420
我们知道太空是你的领域
We realize up there is more your territory,

273
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,990
但这也是我们的战斗
but this is our fight, too.

274
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,090
你知道他在哪吗
You even know where he is?

275
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,380
我认识可能知道的人
I know people who might.

276
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,500
不必麻烦了
Don't bother.

277
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,830
我可以告诉你灭霸在哪
I can tell you where Thanos is.

278
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,880
灭霸花了很长时间来完善我
Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me.

279
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,420
他改造我时  总爱说他的伟大计划
And when he worked, he talked about his Great Plan.

280
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,550
就算被拆解了  我仍然想讨好他
Even disassembled, I wanted to please him.

281
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,390
我会问
I'd ask...

282
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,520
等计划完成后  我们去哪
where would we go once his plan was complete?

283
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,100
他每次的回答都一样
And his answer was always the same.

284
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,730
"去花园"
"To the Garden."

285
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,920
真有爱  灭霸还有退休计划
That's cute. Thanos has a retirement plan.

286
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,070
那他在哪
So, where is he?

287
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,760
灭霸打响指时
When Thanos snapped his fingers...

288
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,170
地球成了宇宙级能量涌的
Earth became ground zero for a power surge

289
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,220
爆发点
of ridiculously cosmic proportions.

290
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,160
可谓前无古人
No one's ever seen anything like it.

291
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,410
直到两天前...
Until two days ago...

292
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,130
这个星球上又发生了一次
on this planet.

293
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,460
灭霸在那儿
Thanos is there.

294
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,050
他又用了一次宝石
He used the stones again.

295
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,280
我们去的话  人手不足
We'd be going in shorthanded, you know?

296
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,740
宝石还在他手里  所以...
Look, he's still got the stones, so...

297
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,810
那我们就去夺回来
So, let's get 'em.

298
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,030
用宝石把大家救回来
Use them to bring everyone back.

299
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,120
就这样
Just like that?

300
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,030
对  就这样
Yeah. Just like that.

301
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,410
哪怕有一丝挽回一切的希望
Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this...

302
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,000
我们也必须为不在这里的每个人一试
I mean, we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try.

303
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,710
就算我们去  我们怎么知道
If we do this, how do we know

304
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,250
结局会跟上次不一样
it's gonna end any differently than it did before?

305
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,160
因为上次你们没有我
Because before you didn't have me.

306
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,780
新来的妹子
Hey, new girl?

307
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,290
这里每个人都是干超级英雄的
Everybody in this room is about that superhero life.

308
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,510
要是你不介意我问问
And if you don't mind my asking,

309
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,890
这么久以来你都去哪了
where the hell have you been all this time?

310
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,210
宇宙里还有很多星球
There are a lot of other planets in the universe.

311
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,960
可惜那些地方没有你们
And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys.

312
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,110
我喜欢她
I like this one.

313
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,740
我们去干掉那个王八蛋
Let's go get this son of a bitch.

314
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,890
好了
Okay.

315
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,770
这里谁没上过太空
Who here hasn't been to space?

316
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,030
怎么了
Why?

317
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,980
你们最好别吐在我飞船里
You better not throw up on my ship.

318
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,850
接近跳跃点  三
Approaching jump in three...

319
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,770
二  一
two, one.

320
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,000
我下去侦查
I'll head down for recon.

321
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,930
这次会成功的  史蒂夫
This is gonna work, Steve.

322
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,310
我知道
I know it will.

323
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,690
因为如果不成功  我不知道该怎么办
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

324
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,920
没有卫星  没有战舰  没有军队
No satellites. No ships. No armies.

325
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,030
没有任何地面防御
No ground defenses of any kind.

326
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,780
只有他
It's just him.

327
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,290
那就够了
And that's enough.

328
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,130
不
Oh, no.

329
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,050
宝石在哪
Where are they?

330
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,600
回答问题
Answer the question.

331
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,060
宇宙需要修正
The universe required correction.

332
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,020
之后  宝石就没有用了
After that, the stones served no purpose...

333
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,830
只是诱惑
beyond temptation.

334
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,490
你杀了数万亿生灵
You murdered trillions!

335
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,610
你应该感激
You should be grateful.

336
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,240
宝石在哪
Where are the stones?

337
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,540
没了
Gone.

338
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,970
化成原子了
Reduced to atoms.

339
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,680
你两天前还用过的
You used them two days ago!

340
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,960
我用宝石摧毁了宝石
I used the stones to destroy the stones.

341
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,710
差点要了我的命
It nearly killed me.

342
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,380
但大业已成
But the work is done.

343
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,970
注定会完成的
It always will be.

344
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,680
我是宿命
I am inevitable.

345
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,250
我们得把这里翻个底朝天  他肯定在撒谎
We have to tear this place apart. He has to be lying!

346
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,860
我父亲有很多特点
My father is many things.

347
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,190
但他不撒谎
A liar is not one of them.

348
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,950
谢谢你  女儿
Thank you, daughter.

349
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,160
也许我过去对你太残酷了
Perhaps I treated you too harshly.

350
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,290
什么
What?

351
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,170
你干了什么
What did you do?

352
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,720
我砍脑袋了
I went for the head.

353
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,330
那个...我...
So, I...

354
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,870
前两天去约会了
went on a date the other day.

355
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,810
这是五年来第一次
It's the first time in five years.

356
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,590
我坐在餐桌前
You know? I'm sitting there at dinner.

357
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,300
都不知道该谈些什么
I didn't even know what to talk about.

358
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,220
你们谈了什么
What did you talk about?

359
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,720
还是老一套  时过境迁了
Same old crap. You know, how things have changed.

360
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,230
我的工作  他的工作
My job, his job.

361
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,770
我们多想念纽约大都会队
How much we miss the Mets.

362
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,320
然后就陷入了沉默
And then things got quiet...

363
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,490
侍者上沙拉时  他哭了
then he cried as they were serving the salads.

364
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,110
那你呢
What about you?

365
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,660
我上甜点之前哭的
I cried just before dessert.

366
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,040
但我明天还要再见他  所以...
But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so...

367
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,080
很棒
That's great.

368
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,140
你已经完成了最难的部分  你鼓起勇气行动了
You did the hardest part. You took the jump.

369
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,000
尽管你不知道结果会如何
You didn't know where you were gonna come down.

370
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,770
就是这样
And that's it.

371
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:27,590
我们得这样勇敢地迈出一个个小步
That's those little brave baby steps we gotta take...

372
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:31,060
努力再次让自己完整  寻找意义
to try and become whole again, try and find purpose.

373
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,530
我1945年落入冰层中
I went in the ice in '45,

374
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,560
那时我才刚遇见自己的一生挚爱
right after I met the love of my life.

375
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,810
再醒来已是七十年后
Woke up 70 years later.

376
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,150
人得向前看
You gotta move on.

377
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,660
必须向前看
Gotta move on.

378
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,750
世界在我们手中
The world is in our hands.

379
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,080
就交给我们了  各位
It's left to us, guys.

380
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,750
我们得做点什么
And we gotta do something with it.

381
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,210
不然...
Otherwise...

382
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,470
灭霸就等于杀了所有人
Thanos should've killed all of us.

383
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,820
什么鬼
What the hell?

384
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,250
霍普
Hope?

385
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:57,970
孩子
Kid!

386
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,160
孩子
Hey, kid!

387
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,130
这里发生什么了
What the hell happened here?

388
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,950
天呐
Oh, my God!

389
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,510
拜托
Oh, please!

390
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,870
拜托
Please, please!

391
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,340
不不不不
No, no, no. No.

392
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:49,800
不
No.

393
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,770
不好意思  抱歉
Excuse me. Sorry.

394
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,930
凯西  不
Oh, Cassie, no.

395
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,680
不不不
No, no, no.

396
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,100
不不
No, no.

397
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,310
千万不要有凯西
Please, please, please. No, Cassie.

398
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,820
什么
What?

399
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,060
凯西
Cassie?

400
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,430
爸
Dad?

401
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,210
你长大了好多
You're so big!

402
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,080
我们登上了那艘
Yeah. We boarded that

403
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,160
丹弗斯说十分可疑的战舰
highly-suspect warship Danvers pinged.

404
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,080
那是一艘有传染病的垃圾驳船
It was an infectious garbage scow.

405
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,670
谢谢你的可靠情报
So, thanks for the hot tip.

406
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,000
你们更近嘛
Well, you were closer.

407
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,590
现在我们全身都是垃圾味
Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.

408
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,260
你采集到震动读数了吗
You get a reading on those tremors?

409
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,050
是非洲板块下的轻微下冲
'Twas a mild subduction under the African plate.

410
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,180
能看到吗  要怎么处理
Do we have a visual? How are we handling it?

411
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,250
小娜
Nat.

412
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,710
只是海底地震
It's an earthquake under the ocean.

413
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,920
处理方式  就是不处理
We handle it by not handling it.

414
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,000
卡罗尔  下个月你会回来吗
Carol, are we seeing you here next month?

415
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,940
不太可能
Not likely.

416
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,900
怎么  你要再去剪一次头发吗
What? You gonna get another haircut?

417
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,380
听着  毛脸
Listen, fur face.

418
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,530
我要负责的地域很广
I'm covering a lot of territory.

419
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,200
发生在地球上的这些事
The things that are happening on Earth

420
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,850
到处都在发生
are happening everywhere.

421
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,620
在成千上万个星球上
On thousands of planets.

422
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,450
好吧  说得也是
All right, all right. That's a good point.

423
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,600
说得也是
That's a good point.

424
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,690
所以你们可能很长一段时间见不到我了
So, you might not see me for a long time.

425
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,520
好吧  那...
All right. Uh, well...

426
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,830
这个频道会一直开启
This channel's always active.

427
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,200
所以如果发生任何事
So, if anything goes sideways...

428
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,610
任何人在不该惹麻烦的地方制造麻烦
anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't...

429
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,660
都先通知我
comes through me.

430
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,180
-好  -好
- Okay.  - Okay.

431
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,200
那好
All right.

432
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,620
祝你好运
Good luck.

433
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,210
你在哪
Where are you?

434
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,310
墨西哥
Mexico.

435
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,220
联邦调查局发现了一房间的尸体
The Federales found a room full of bodies.

436
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,320
似乎是一群贩毒集团的人
Looks like a bunch of cartel guys...

437
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,150
甚至都没机会掏枪
never even had a chance to get their guns off.

438
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,970
八成是敌对帮派干的
I mean, it's probably a rival gang.

439
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,600
但不是
Except it isn't.

440
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,190
肯定是巴顿
It's definitely Barton.

441
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,690
他在这里做的事
What he's done here...

442
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,820
他过去几年里做的事
what he's been doing for the last few years...

443
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,990
他所留下的场面
I mean, the scene that he left...

444
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,590
我得说
I gotta tell you,

445
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,820
我心里都有点不想找到他
there's a part of me that doesn't even wanna find him.

446
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,830
你能查出他接下来要去哪吗
Will you find out where he's going next?

447
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,000
小娜
Nat?

448
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,760
拜托了
Please?

449
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,380
好
Okay.

450
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,440
我倒想提出亲自给你下厨
You know, I'd offer to cook you dinner, but...

451
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,560
但你似乎已经很痛苦了
you seem pretty miserable already.

452
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,790
你是来洗衣服的吗
You here to do your laundry?

453
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,990
也来看看朋友
And to see a friend.

454
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,160
显然  你的朋友很好
Clearly, your friend is fine.

455
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,260
我过桥的时候
You know, I saw a pod of whales

456
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,510
看到了一群鲸鱼
when I was coming over the bridge.

457
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,510
在哈德逊河里吗
In the Hudson?

458
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,640
船只少了  水就清了
There's fewer ships... cleaner water.

459
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,750
如果你要跟我说
You know, if you're about to tell me

460
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,710
去看好的一面
to look on the bright side...

461
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,050
我就用花生酱三明治砸你的头
I'm about to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich.

462
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,890
抱歉
Sorry.

463
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,310
旧习难改
Force of habit.

464
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,800
我一直告诉大家要放下过去
You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on...

465
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,030
继续生活
and grow.

466
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:31,950
有些人这么做了
Some do.

467
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,790
但是我们不行
But not us.

468
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,790
如果我放下过去  谁来做这些事
If I move on, who does this?

469
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,050
也许这些事不需要做
Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

470
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,300
以前我一无所有
I used to have nothing.

471
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,640
然后我拥有了这些
And then I got this.

472
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,390
这份工作
This job.

473
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,650
这个家庭
This family.

474
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,190
我因此
And I was

475
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,660
变得更好
I was better because of it.

476
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:17,790
虽然他们都不在了
And even though they're gone...

477
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,500
我还是在尽量变得更好
I'm still trying to be better.

478
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,220
我觉得我们俩都需要有点私生活
I think we both need to get a life.

479
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,180
你先来
You first.

480
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,200
有人在吗
Is anyone home?

481
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,110
我是斯科特·朗
This is, uh, Scott Lang.

482
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,360
我们几年前在机场见过
We met a few years ago at the airport...

483
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,530
德国的机场
in Germany?

484
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,510
我是那个变大的人  我当时戴了面具
I was the guy that got really big. I had a mask on.

485
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,170
-你们大概认不出我  -这是以前的信息吗
- You wouldn't recognize me. - Is this an old message?

486
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,470
蚁人  我知道你们知道我
Ant-Man? I know you know... I know you know that.

487
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,210
-那是前门  -我真的需要和你们谈谈
- It's the front gate.  - I really need to talk to you guys.

488
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,130
斯科特
Scott.

489
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,360
你没事吧
Are you okay?

490
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,260
我没事
Yeah.

491
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,550
你们俩学过量子物理学吗
Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics?

492
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,680
只有一点点了解
Only to make conversation.

493
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,810
好吧  是这样...
All right, so...

494
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,520
五年前  就在...
five years ago, right before...

495
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,310
灭霸的事发生前...
Thanos...

496
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,610
我进入了一个叫量子域的地方
I was in a place called the quantum realm.

497
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,550
量子域有它自己的微观宇宙
The quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe.

498
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,700
要想进去  你得变得非常非常小
To get in there, you have to be incredibly small.

499
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,200
霍普  她是我的...
Hope. She's my, um...

500
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,740
她本是我的...
She was my...

501
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,930
她本应该把我拉出来的
She was supposed to pull me out.

502
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,640
然后灭霸的事发生了...
And then Thanos happened...

503
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,750
我就被困在里面了
and I got stuck in there.

504
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,770
很遗憾  这五年一定很漫长
I'm sorry, that must have been a very long five years.

505
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,040
是啊  问题就在这里
Yeah, but that's just it.

506
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,630
并不漫长
It wasn't.

507
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,310
对我来说  只有五个小时
For me, it was five hours.

508
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,690
量子域的法则
See, the rules of the quantum realm

509
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:50,900
跟这个世界不一样
aren't like they are up here.

510
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,570
一切都不可预测
Everything is unpredictable.

511
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,940
那个三明治有人要吗
Is that anybody's sandwich?

512
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,220
我饿死了
I'm starving.

513
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,680
斯科特
Scott.

514
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,430
你说的是什么意思
What are you talking about?

515
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,060
所以...
So...

516
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,940
我想说的是...
what I'm saying is...

517
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,440
在量子域里  时间有不同的运行方式
time works differently in the quantum realm.

518
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,030
唯一的问题是  现在
The only problem is right now

519
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,090
我们没法在其中定位
we don't have a way to navigate it.

520
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,240
但如果有办法呢
But what if we did?

521
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,630
我一直在思考这个
I can't stop thinking about it.

522
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,130
如果我们能想办法控制这种混沌
What if we could somehow control the chaos...

523
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,130
并在其中定位呢
and we could navigate it?

524
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,880
如果我们有办法
What if there was a way...

525
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,550
在某个特定时间点
that we could enter the quantum realm

526
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,800
进入量子域
at a certain point in time...

527
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,310
然后在另一个特定时间点
but then exit the quantum realm

528
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,890
离开量子域呢
at another point in time?

529
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:24,750
比如说
Like...

530
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,960
-在灭霸打响指之前  -等等
- Like before Thanos. - Wait.

531
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,840
你指的是时间机器吗
Are you talking about a time machine?

532
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,770
不  不  当然不是  不是时间机器
No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine.

533
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,090
这更像是...
This is more like a...

534
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,700
没错  就是时间机器
Yeah. Like a time machine.

535
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,720
我知道  这很疯狂  非常疯狂
I know, it's crazy. It's crazy.

536
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,780
但我就一直在思考这个
But I can't stop thinking about it.

537
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,060
肯定有...
There's gotta be...

538
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,270
办法的...
some way...

539
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,080
-是很疯狂  -斯科特
- It's crazy. - Scott.

540
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,790
我能收到一只浣熊发的邮件
I get emails from a raccoon...

541
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,150
所以  再没什么算是"疯狂"了
so nothing sounds crazy anymore.

542
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,700
那么  我们要跟谁讨论这个
So, who do we talk to about this?

543
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:12,800
开饭咯
Chow time!

544
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,550
摩古娜
Maguna.

545
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,600
摩根·H·斯塔克  你想吃午饭吗
Morgan H. Stark, you want some lunch?

546
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,870
定义一下"午饭"  不然
Define "lunch" or be

547
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,230
-就等着被灭吧  -好吧
- disintegrated. - Okay.

548
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,330
你不应该戴这个  好吗
You should not be wearing that, okay?

549
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,080
这是我给妈妈做的周年纪念
That is part of a special anniversary gift

550
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,360
特别礼物里的
I'm making for Mom.

551
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,240
好了  想吃午饭吗
There you go. You thinking about lunch?

552
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,720
我可以拿莴苣包一把蟋蟀给你
I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.

553
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,540
-不  -你不是想吃那个吗
- No. - That's what you want.

554
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,050
你怎么找到这个的
How did you find this?

555
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,810
-在车库里  -真的吗
- Garage. - Really?

556
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,040
-你是有意去找它的吗  -没有
- Were you looking for it? - No.

557
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,340
反正我找到了
I found it, though.

558
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,520
你喜欢进车库是吗
You like going in the garage, huh?

559
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,170
爸爸也是
So does Daddy.

560
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,760
其实没关系  我给妈妈买的礼物她从来不穿
It's fine, actually. Mom never wears anything I buy her.

561
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,430
那么  我要...
So, I'm gonna...

562
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,670
不  我们知道这听上去多疯狂
No. We know what it sounds like.

563
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,010
托尼  在经历过这一切之后
Tony, after everything you've seen,

564
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,890
-难道还真有不可能的事吗  -量子波动
- is anything really impossible? - Quantum fluctuation

565
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,220
达到普朗克尺度
messes with the Planck scale...

566
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,930
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}大卫·德将量子理论与多重宇宙理论结合
提出回到过去只是进入另一个平行宇宙

567
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,930
并引出德氏观点
which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition.

568
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:29,250
我们能认同这一点吗
Can we agree on that?

569
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,350
谢谢
Thank you.

570
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:33,040
通俗地讲  就是你无法回到这里了
In layman's terms, it means you're not coming home.

571
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,150
-我回来了  -不对
- I did. - No.

572
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,710
你是碰巧幸存了
You accidentally survived.

573
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,300
这是十亿分之一的宇宙侥幸
It's a billion-to-one cosmic fluke.

574
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,050
现在你想进行...
And now you wanna pull a...

575
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,930
你怎么说的来着
What do you call it?

576
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,120
时间盗窃
A time heist?

577
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,530
没错  时间盗窃  当然了
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.

578
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,980
我们之前怎么没想到呢
Why didn't we think of this before?

579
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,580
因为这太好笑了  简直是白日梦
Because it's laughable. Because it's a pipe dream.

580
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,320
无限宝石都在过去
The stones are in the past.

581
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,040
我们可以回去拿到它们
We could go back, we could get them.

582
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,380
我们可以自己打响指  把所有人带回来
We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everybody back.

583
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,630
或者让事情变得更糟  对吗
Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?

584
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,170
我觉得我们不会的
I don't believe we would.

585
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,330
不得不说  有时我还挺怀念你的乐观
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss that giddy optimism.

586
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,260
然而  如果没有合理可行的方法
However, high hopes won't help

587
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,390
来安全地进行所谓的时间盗窃
if there's no logical, tangible way

588
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:12,350
寄予厚望也没用
for me to safely execute said time heist.

589
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,020
我认为最可能的后果
I believe the most likely outcome

590
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,060
就是我们共同灭亡
will be our collective demise.

591
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,090
只要我们严格遵守时间旅行的规则就不会
Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel.

592
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:21,030
就是说  不可以跟过去的自己交谈
All right? It means no talking to our past selves...

593
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,400
不可以给体育比赛下注
no betting on sporting events.

594
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,810
我得让你打住了  斯科特
I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott.

595
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,870
你真要跟我说
Are you seriously telling me

596
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,450
你拯救宇宙的计划
that your plan to save the universe...

597
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,600
是基于《回到未来》的吗
is based on Back to the Future?

598
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,480
-是吗  -不是
- Is it? - No.

599
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,580
很好  你刚刚害我有点担忧
Good. You had me worried there.

600
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,730
因为那就扯淡了
'Cause that would be horseshit.

601
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,210
量子物理的原理不是那样的
That's not how quantum physics works.

602
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,110
托尼
Tony.

603
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,120
我们必须奋起抗争
We have to take a stand.

604
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,030
我们抗争了  但还是落得这个地步
We did stand. And yet, here we are.

605
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,600
我知道你有很多顾虑
I know you got a lot on the line.

606
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,540
你有妻子  女儿
You got a wife, a daughter.

607
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,380
但我也失去了对我非常重要的人
But I lost someone very important to me.

608
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,460
很多人都是
A lotta people did.

609
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,690
而现在  我们有机会让她回来
And now, now we have a chance to bring her back...

610
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,070
让所有人回来
to bring everyone back,

611
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,400
而你却告诉我  你甚至都不...
and you're telling me that you won't even...

612
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,510
是的  斯科特  我甚至都不
That's right, Scott. I won't even.

613
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,390
我做不到
I can't.

614
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,890
妈妈让我来救你
Mommy told me to come and save you.

615
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,610
干得好  你救下我了
Good job. I'm saved.

616
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,420
我真希望你们是来问我其他事的
I wish you were coming here to ask me something else.

617
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,610
什么都行
Anything else.

618
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,420
我真的很高兴见到你们  我只是...
I'm honestly happy to see you guys, I just...

619
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,710
对了  我们准备了六人份的午餐
Oh, look, the table's set for six.

620
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,530
托尼  我懂
Tony. I get it.

621
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,820
我为你高兴  真的
And I'm happy for you. I really am.

622
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,620
但这是我们的第二次机会
But this is a second chance.

623
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,080
我的第二次机会就在这儿呢  队长
I got my second chance right here, Cap.

624
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,830
我不能拿她冒险
Can't roll the dice on it.

625
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,250
只要不谈工作  你们可以留下来用午餐
If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch.

626
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,590
他害怕了
Well, he's scared.

627
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,180
他没有错
He's not wrong.

628
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,400
是啊  但是  我们该怎么办
Yeah, but, I mean, what are we, what are we, what are we gonna do?

629
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,140
我们需要他  我们就这么放弃吗
We need him. What, are we gonna stop?

630
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,510
不  我想把这事做好
No, I wanna do it right.

631
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,730
我们需要一个大大脑
We're gonna need a really big brain.

632
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,690
比他的还大吗
Bigger than his?

633
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,290
别这样  怎么好像就我一个人在吃
Come on, I feel like I'm the only one eating here.

634
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,360
尝尝那个
Try some of that.

635
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,820
来点炒蛋
Have some eggs.

636
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,380
我好困惑
I'm so confused.

637
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,910
现在就是令人困惑的年代
These are confusing times.

638
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,090
是啊  不  不  我不是那个意思
Right, no, no. That's not what I meant.

639
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:10,200
我懂啦  我开玩笑的
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

640
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,120
我知道  这很疯狂
I know, it's crazy.

641
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,720
我都开始穿衬衫了
I'm wearing shirts now.

642
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,960
是啊  什么  怎么会  为什么
Yeah. What? How? Why?

643
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,460
五年前  我们惨败
Five years ago, we got our asses beat.

644
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,520
只不过我更惨
Except it was worse for me...

645
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,020
因为我输了两次
'cause I lost twice.

646
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,340
先是绿巨人输了  后来班纳又输了
First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost...

647
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,190
再后来  我们都输了
and then, we all lost.

648
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,740
没人怪你  布鲁斯
No one blamed you, Bruce.

649
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,640
我怪
I did.

650
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,120
这么多年来  我一直把绿巨人
For years, I've been treating the Hulk

651
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,450
当成一种疾病
like he's some kind of disease...

652
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,640
一种需要摆脱的东西
something to get rid of.

653
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,400
但后来  我开始视他为出路
But then, I start looking at him as the cure.

654
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,040
我在伽马实验室待了18个月
Eighteen months in the gamma lab.

655
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,740
把思想和力量融为了一体
I put the brains and the brawn together...

656
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,490
现在看看我
and now, look at me.

657
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,990
两个自我的最佳状态
Best of both worlds.

658
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,840
-打扰一下  绿巨人先生  -什么事
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk? - Yes.

659
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,330
我们能跟你合影吗
Can we get a photo?

660
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,550
当然可以  小朋友
100%, little person.

661
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,790
来  站过来  能帮个忙吗
Come on, step on up. Do you mind?

662
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,830
-当然  -谢谢
- Oh, yeah, yeah. - Thanks.

663
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,540
说"绿"
Say "Green."

664
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,560
-绿  -绿
- Green. - Green.

665
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,480
拍到了吗
Did you get that?

666
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,590
拍得很好
That's a good one.

667
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,140
你们也想跟我合个影吗  我是蚁人
Did you want to grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man.

668
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,110
他们是绿巨人的粉丝
They're Hulk fans.

669
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,280
-他们不知道蚁人  -等等  不  不
- They don't know Ant-Man. - Wait. No, no.

670
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,580
-他难过了  -没人知道
- He feel bad. - Nobody...nobody does.

671
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,780
-他想跟你们...  -我不想合影
- No, he wants you...  - I don't want a picture.

672
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,330
-他想跟你们合影  -陌生人很危险
- He wants you to take a picture with him. - Stranger danger.

673
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,200
你看  他都说不要了
Yeah, look, he's even saying no, he doesn't.

674
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,580
-我懂  我也不想  -别这样  那孩子
- I get it. I don't want it, either. - But come on, the kid, but...

675
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,880
-我不想跟他们合影  -可你...
- I don't want a picture with them. - But you...

676
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,080
-他会难过的  -抱歉
- He's gonna feel bad. - Sorry.

677
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,210
他们乐意的  他们说愿意了
They're happy to do it. They said they'll do it.

678
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,500
-我不想合影  -我们可以拍的
- I don't want to do it. - We can do it.

679
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,170
-不  你难过了  -把手机拿走
- No, you...you feel bad. - Take the goddamn phone.

680

688
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,590
关于我们刚刚谈到的
About what we were saying.

689
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,170
好吧
Right.

690
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,720
时间旅行重来一次的事
The whole time travel do-over?

691
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,770
各位  这不是我专长的领域
Guys, it's outside of my area of expertise.

692
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,390
这事你都搞定了
Well, you pulled this off.

693
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,980
我记得这曾经也看似不可能
I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible, too.

694
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,410
我有个小灵感
I've got a mild inspiration.

695
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,720
我想看看行不行得通
I'd like to see if it checks out.

696
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,080
所以  今晚收工前
So, I'd like to run one last sim

697
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,810
我想再做一次模拟
before we pack it in for the night.

698
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:45,000
这一次  以莫比乌斯环的形态
This time, in the shape of a Mobius strip,

699
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,370
请逆转

正在处理

好吧  把那个粒子的特征值
Right, give me the eigenvalue of that particle

702
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,760
进行光谱分解
factoring in spectral decomp.

703
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,160
-这会需要点时间  -请稍等
- That'll take a second. - Just a moment.

704
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,750
不成功也没事  我只是...
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda...

705

模型渲染完毕

你怎么起来了  小丫头
What are you doing up, little miss?

709
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,040
-该死  -不  我们不能说那种话
- Shit. - Nope. We don't say that.

710
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,250
只有妈妈可以说那个词
Only Mommy says that word.

711
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,080
那是她创造的  是她的专属词
She coined it. It belongs to her.

712
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,090
你怎么还不睡
Why are you up?

713
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,090
因为我还有大事要做
'Cause I've got some important shit going on here!

714
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:33,840
要不然呢
Why do you think?

715
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,550
不  我有心事
No, I got something on my mind.

00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,290
是的
Sure was.

719
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,680
这是敲诈  敲诈是个词
That's extortion. That's a word.

720
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,670
你想要什么味的
What kind you want?

00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,020
英雄所见略同
Great minds think alike.

722

给我讲个故事
Tell me a story.

736
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:34,300
快睡觉  不然我把你玩具全卖了
Go to bed or I'll sell all your toys.

737
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,300
晚安
Night night.

738
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,440
虽然这不是竞争
Not that it's a competition...

你大概也就在六百到九百之间吧

时间旅行

这...
That's...

太惊人了
amazing and

752
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,600
也很可怕
terrifying.

00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,640
是啊
That's right.

很多人可没这么幸运
A lot of people didn't.

758
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,780
对  我也不可能帮助所有人
Nope. And I can't help everybody.

759
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,170
看来你可以
Sorta seems like you can.

760
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,160
除非我停手
Not if I stop.

761
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:47,620
我可以马上收手不干
I can put a pin in it right now and stop.

762
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,290
托尼
Tony...

763
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,880
劝你收手
trying to get you to stop...

764
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,750
是我这辈子少数做不到的事之一
has been one of the few failures of my entire life.

765
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,800
我有几分觉得  我该把它
Something tells me I should put it in a

766
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,220
锁进盒子里  沉进湖底
lockbox and drop it to the bottom of the lake...

767
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,850
然后上床睡觉
and go to bed.

768
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,320
但你能安心睡着吗
But would you be able to rest?

769
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,990
好  准备好  时间旅行测试1
Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one.

770
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:25,950
斯科特  启动
Scott, fire up...the, uh,

771
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,040

紧急发电机已就绪
Emergency generators are on standby.

00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:34,890
很好  因为如果我们烧断了电网
Good, because if we blow the grid,

775
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,520
我可不想把小不点丢在上世纪五十年代
I don't want to lose, uh, Tiny here in the 1950s.

776
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,260
-你说什么  -他在开玩笑呢
- Excuse me? - He's kidding.

777
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,860
你不能说这种话
You can't say things like that.

778
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,470
就是个冷笑话而已
It was a bad joke.

779
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,370
你是在开玩笑  对吧
You were kidding, right?

780
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:51,540
我不知道  这可是时间旅行
I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here.

781
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,860
要么就是玩笑  要么就是玩完
Either it's all a joke, or none of it is.

782
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:55,190
我们准备好了

斯科特  我要把你送回一周之前

785
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,420
让你待一个小时

786
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,450
然后10秒后带你回来
then bring you back in 10 seconds.

787
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,660
懂吗
Make sense?

788
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,300

祝你好运  斯科特  你能行的
Good luck, Scott. You got this.

790

00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,210
我能行的  美国队长
I do, Captain America.

792
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,310
三秒倒计时
On a count of three...

793
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:20,550
三  二  一
Three, two, one.

794
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,720
各位
Guys?

795
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,160
这感觉不对劲
This doesn't feel right.

796
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,740
怎么回事
What is this?

797
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,820
-这是怎么了  -那是谁
- What's going on? - Who is that?

798
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:30,660
-等等  -那是斯科特吗
- Hold on. - Is that Scott?

799
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,940
当然是了
Yes, it's Scott.

800
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:37,080
-怎么回事  布鲁斯  -我的背
- What's going on, Bruce? - Oh, my back!

801
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,290
-这又怎么回事  -等等的
- What is this? - Hold on a second.

802
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:39,540
-能让让吗  -当然
- Could I get a little space here? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

803
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,630
你能把他变回来吗
Can you bring him back?

804
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:41,780
我在努力呢
I'm working on it.

805
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:49,720
是个婴儿
It's a baby.

806
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,550
-是斯科特  -婴儿的斯科特
- It's Scott. - As a baby.

807
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,140
-他会长大的  -把斯科特变回来
- He'll grow. - Bring Scott back.

808
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,810
我说断电时  就断电
When I say kill the power, kill the power.

809
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:55,790
天呐
Oh, my God.

810
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,420
准备...断电
And... kill it!

811
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,340
有人尿在我裤子里了
Somebody peed my pants.

812
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,480
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

813
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:08,890
但我不确定是婴儿的我  还是老年的我
But I don't know if it was baby me or old me.

814
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,330
还是就是我
Or just me me.

815
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:15,810
时间旅行啊
Time travel!

816
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,400
怎么了
What?

817
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,490
我觉得这绝对是成功啊
I see this as an absolute win.

818
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,280
干吗拉个脸
Why the long face?

819
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,200
我猜猜  他变成婴儿了
Let me guess, he turned into a baby.

820
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,510
还不止  对  你怎么来了
Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?

821
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,370
是爱波罗悖论
It's the EPR Paradox.

822
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,060
你们没能让朗在时间里移动
Instead of pushing Lang through time,

823
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,390
而是让时间在朗身上流动了
you might've wound up pushing time through Lang.

824
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,270
这很不好弄  很危险
It's tricky, dangerous.

825
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:25,260
真该有人提醒你注意的
Somebody could have cautioned you against it.

826
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,380
你提醒了
You did.

827
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:27,800
是吗
Oh, did I?

828
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,970
幸好我来了
Well, thank God I'm here.

829
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,350
不管怎样  我解决了
Regardless, I fixed it.

830
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:35,600
完全好用的时间空间定位仪
A fully functioning time-space GPS.

831
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:38,850
我只想要和平
I just want peace.

832
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:43,230
原来怨恨会腐蚀心灵  我讨厌它
Turns out resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.

833
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,860
我也是
Me, too.

834
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:47,880
我们有机会拿到宝石
We got a shot at getting these stones,

835
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,070
但我得告诉你我最看重什么
but I gotta tell you my priorities.

836
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:52,620
找回我们失去的  希望可以
Bring back what we lost, I hope, yes.

837
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,540
留住我得到的  我必须  不惜一切
Keep what I found, I have to, at all costs.

838
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:59,330
或许  不用杀身成仁
And maybe not die trying.

839
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,750
那样最好了
Would be nice.

840
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,300
听上去不错
Sounds like a deal.

841
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:28,920
托尼  这好吗
Tony, I don't know.

842
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,820
怎么了
Why?

843
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:31,740
这是他为你造的
He made it for you.

844
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,590
而且  说实在的  我得赶紧从车库里取出来
Plus, honestly, I have to get it out of the garage

845
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,490
不然要被摩根拿去滑着玩了
before Morgan takes it sledding.

846
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:42,960
谢谢  托尼
Thank you, Tony.

847
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:45,500
你能别声张吗
Will you keep that a little quiet?

848
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,880
我可没给全队都带礼物来
Didn't bring one for the whole team.

849
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,550
是全队都来吧
We are getting the whole team, yeah?

850
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:54,600
我们正在集结人手呢
We're working on that right now.

851
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:13,990
人类
Hey, Humie.

852
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,870
大绿呢
Where's Big Green?

853
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,450
在厨房里吧
The kitchen, I think.

854
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,790
好赞啊
That's awesome.

855
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,330
罗德  降落时小心
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.

856
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:26,290
降落区有个白痴
There's an idiot in the landing zone.

857
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,500
天呐
Oh, God.

858
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,920
好啊  普通大小的哥们
What's up, Regular-Sized Man?

859
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:23,990
跟金宫殿  魔法锤比
Kind of a step down from the golden palaces

860
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:26,160
差远了啊
and the magic hammers and whatnot.

861
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,790
有点同情心嘛  伙计
Hey, have a little compassion, pal.

862
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:30,000
他们先失去了阿斯加德  然后又失去了半数人民
First, they lost Asgard, then half their people.

863
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,630
他们大概有个家就很开心了
They're probably just happy to have a home.

864
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:33,280
你们不该来的
You shouldn't have come.

865
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,590
女武神
Valkyrie!

866
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:39,370
见到你真高兴  生气姑娘
Great to see you, angry girl!

867
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:42,410
我觉得你另外两个形态哪个都比这样好
I think I liked you better either of the other ways.

868
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:43,800
这是火箭
This is Rocket.

869
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:44,660
你好
How ya doing?

870
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:48,500
他不会见你们的
He won't see you.

871
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,850
那么糟吗
It's that bad, huh?

872
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,150
我们每月只能见到他一次
We only see him once a month

873
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:54,880
在他来取"补给"时
when he comes in for "supplies."

874
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,400
那么糟啊
It's that bad.

875
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,300
是啊
Yeah.

876
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:11,480
搞什么
What the...?

877
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:16,570
这里面一股腐臭
Something died in here!

878
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,740
有人吗  托尔
Hello? Thor!

879
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,030
你是来修电视的吗
Are you here about the cable?

880
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:24,950
电影频道两周前就收不到了
The Cinemax went out two weeks ago and...

881
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,170
体育频道也都模模糊糊的
the sports are all kinda fuzzy and whatnot.

882
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:29,710
托尔
Thor?

883
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:40,600

Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.

887
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,830
真没必要
That's not necessary.

888
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,580
绿巨人  你认识我的朋友米克和寇格吧
Hulk, you know my friends Miek and Korg, right?

889
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,040

电视上那小子刚刚又喊我蠢货了
That kid on the TV just called me a dickhead again.

896
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,040
新手大师

00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,930
对  新手大师69

898
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:11,630
-喊我蠢货  -我受够了

899
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:14,140
新手大师  还是托尔
Noobmaster, hey, it's Thor again.

900
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:15,520

我就飞去你家
I am gonna fly over to your house,

903

冲进你正躲在的地下室里
come down to that basement you're hiding in,

904
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,970
扯掉你的胳膊  塞进你屁眼里
rip off your arms, and shove them up your butt!

905
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,070
没错
Oh, that's right, yes!

906
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:27,390
去你爸那儿哭吧  小混蛋
Go cry to your father, you little weasel.

907
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:28,740
谢谢  托尔
Thank you, Thor.

908
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,410
他再敢欺负你就告诉我  好吗

非常感谢  我会的

我有啤酒  龙舌兰  什么都有

我看上去不好吗
Why, don't I look all right?

915
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,830
你看上去像融化的冰淇淋
You look like melted ice cream.

916
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,920
怎么  你就是来玩的吗
So, what's up? You just here for a hang, or what?

917
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,250
我们需要你帮忙
We need your help.

918

920
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:59,400
因为这事折磨我几周了
'Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks.

921
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,630
是灭霸
Like Thanos.

922
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:22,740
别提那个名字
Don't say that name.

923
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:26,370
是啊  我们这里不提那个名字的
Yeah, we don't actually say that name in here.

924
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,210
请把你的手拿开
Please take your hand off me.

925
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:39,630
我知道那...家伙
Now, I know that guy...

926
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,630
可能让你害怕
might scare you.

927
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:42,930
怎么会呢
Why would I be...?

928
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,180
我怎么会怕那家伙
Why would I be scared of that guy?

929
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,760
是我杀了那家伙  记得吗
I'm the one who killed that guy, remember?

930

这里有别人杀他了吗
Anyone else here kill that guy?

931
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:55,940
没有
Nope.

932
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:58,150
我猜也是
Didn't think so.

933
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,740
寇格  你跟大家说说
Korg, why don't you, uh, tell everybody

934
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,200
是谁砍掉了灭霸的大脑袋
who chopped Thanos' big head off?

935
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,460
风暴斧吗
Stormbreaker?

936
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,570
那是谁挥的风暴斧
Who was swinging Stormbreaker?

937
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:12,850
我懂的  你心里很难过
I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay?

938
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,060
我也经历过
I've been there myself.

939
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,880
知道是谁帮我走出来的吗
And you want to know who helped me out of it?

940
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:18,880
是娜塔莎吗
Was it Natasha?

941
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:20,590
是你
It was you.

942
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,720
是你帮了我
You helped me.

943
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,390
那你怎么不去问问
So, why don't you ask...

944
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:29,220
下面的阿斯加德人
the Asgardians down there...

945
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,310
我的帮助有多少价值
how much my help is worth?

946
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:38,770
至少是还剩下的那些
The ones that are left, anyway.

947
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,610
我觉得我们能把他们找回来
I think we could bring them back.

948
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,320
住口
Stop.

949
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:44,700
别说了  好吗
Stop, okay?

950
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,420
我知道你觉得我是待在这里
I know you think I'm down here

951
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,380
沉湎于自怨自艾之中
wallowing in my own self-pity...

952
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:51,010
等着有人来拯救
waiting to be rescued and saved...

953
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:53,390
但我没事  好吗  我们都没事  是吧
but I'm fine, okay. We're fine, aren't we?

954
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:54,390
我们很好  伙计
Oh, we're good here, mate.

955
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:57,060
所以  不管你有什么提议  我们不感兴趣
So, whatever it is that you're offering, we're not into it.

956
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,790
不在乎  完全不在乎
Don't care. Couldn't care less.

957
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:59,840
再见
Goodbye.

958
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:04,550
我们需要你  伙计
We need you, pal.

959
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:15,940
船上有啤酒
There's beer on the ship.

960
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,610
哪种的
What kind?

961
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,380
我想要的
What I want

962
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:11,840
你给不了
you can't give me.

963
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:36,740
你不该来的
You shouldn't be here.

964
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,410
你也不该
Neither should you.

965
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:48,590
我有工作要做
I've got a job to do.

966
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:51,720
你管这叫工作吗
Is that what you're calling this?

967
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:55,220
杀这些人也不能让你的家人回来
Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back.

968
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,390
我们有发现
We found something.

969
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:05,860
或许是一线希望
A chance, maybe.

970
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,190
别
Don't.

971
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,490
别什么
Don't what?

972
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,070
别给我希望
Don't give me hope.

973
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:22,870
很抱歉我没能早点给你
I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.

974
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:46,060
你左偏了
You're drifting left.

975
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,310
小心点  督爷
One side there, Lebowski.

976
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:52,860
火贱  干得怎么样了
Ratchet, how's it going?

977
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,000
是火箭
It's Rocket.

978
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,160
你放尊敬点  你只在地球上是天才  伙计
Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal.

979
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:03,450
时间旅行服  不赖啊
Time travel suit, not bad.

980
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,260
小心点
Easy! Easy!

981
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:07,390
我很小心了
I'm being very careful.

982
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:09,020
不  你很绿巨人
No, you're being very Hulky.

983
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:09,810
我很小心了
I'm being careful.

984
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:11,480
这可是皮姆粒子
These are Pym Particles, all right?

985
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,690
因为汉克·皮姆已被响指打消失了
And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence,

986
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,310
我们只剩这些了
this is it.

987
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,400
我们只有这么多  我们再造不出更多了
This is what we have. We're not making any more.

988
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,430
-斯科特  冷静  -抱歉
- Scott, calm down. - Sorry.

989
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:21,530
我们只够每人往返一次  再就没了
We've got enough for one round-trip each. That's it.

990
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:22,530
不能重来
No do-overs.

991
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:24,770
还能做两次测试
Plus two test runs.

992
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:30,480
一次测试
One test run.

993
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:33,210
好吧  我没准备好呢
All right. I'm not ready for this.

994
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:34,030
我愿意
I'm game.

995
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:37,570
我去吧
I'll do it.

996
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,290
克林特  你会因时移
Clint, now you're gonna feel a little

997
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:41,930
而感到有些混乱
discombobulated from the chronoshift.

998
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:42,590
不用担心的
Don't worry about that.

999
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,220
等等  我问你件事
Wait, wait, wait a second. Let me ask you something.

1000
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,620
如果我们能做到
If we can do this, you know...

1001
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:48,390
回到过去  何不去找到婴儿灭霸
go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos?

1002
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:49,210
然后...
You know, and...

1003
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,060
首先  这太黑暗了
First of all, that's horrible.

1004
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:55,770
那是灭霸啊
It's Thanos.

1005
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:58,110
其次  时间不是那样的
And secondly, time doesn't work that way.

1006
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:00,530
改变过去不能改变未来
Changing the past doesn't change the future.

1007
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:02,030
我们回到过去  赶在灭霸之前
Look, we go back, we get the stones

1008
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:03,410
拿到宝石
before Thanos gets them...

1009
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:06,120
灭霸就拿不到宝石了  问题解决
Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved.

1010
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,120
-是啊  -原理不是这样的
- Bingo. - That's not how it works.

1011
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,160
我听说是这样的
Well, that's what I heard.

1012
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,500
谁  谁说的
Wait, but who? Who told you that?

1013
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,710
《星际迷航》《终结者》《时间警察》
Star Trek, Terminator, Timecop...

1014
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:14,210
-《两世奇人》  -《量子跳跃》
- Time After Time. - Quantum Leap.

1015
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:15,460
《时间的皱折》《时光倒流七十年》
Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time.

1016
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,290
《热浴盆时光机》
Hot Tub Time Machine.

1017
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:17,590
《热浴盆时光机》
Hot Tub Time Machine.

1018
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:19,000
《比尔和泰德历险记》
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.

1019
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:21,590
基本上所有讲时间旅行的电影都是这样的
Basically, any movie that deals with time travel.

1020
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:23,340
《虎胆龙威》  不对  那个不是
Die Hard. No, that's not one.

1021
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:24,380
这是已知定律
This is known.

1022
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:25,890
我不知道为什么大家都相信那个
I don't know why everyone believes that,

1023
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:26,930
但那不是真的
but that isn't true.

1024
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,220
想想看  如果你回到过去
Think about it. If you travel to the past...

1025
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:31,390
那过去就是你的未来了
that past becomes your future...

1026
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,770
你之前的现在  就成了过去
and your former present becomes the past...

1027
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:37,400
它是不能被你的新未来改变的
which can't now be changed by your new future.

1028
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,470
没错
Exactly.

1029
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,720
所以《回到未来》就是胡扯吗
So Back to the Future is a bunch of bullshit?

1030
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:47,730
好  克林特
All right, Clint.

1031
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,190
准备  三  二
We're going in three, two...

1032
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:52,400
一
one.

1033
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,100
库珀
Cooper?

1034
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:09,060
-我的耳机呢  -莱拉
- Where are my headphones? - Lila?

1035
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,660
-我没拿  -莱拉
- I never had them. - Lila?

1036
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,770
你昨天拿了
Yeah, you had them yesterday!

1037
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:16,060
莱拉  莱拉
Lila! Lila!

1038
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:22,400
怎么了  爸爸
Yeah, Dad?

1039
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,030
爸爸
Dad?

1040
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:30,870
莱拉
Lila!

1041
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:39,480
看着我
Look at me.

1042
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:40,300
你没事吧
You okay?

1043
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,170
没事
Yeah.

1044
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:43,630
没事
Yeah.

1045
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:45,970
成功了
It worked.

1046
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:48,930
成功了
It worked.

1047
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:54,440
好  办法可行
Okay, so the how works.

1048
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:58,440
现在我们得确定时间和地点
Now, we gotta figure out the when and the where.

1049
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,120
这房间里几乎每个人都曾遭遇过
Almost everyone in this room has had an encounter

1050
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:02,710
六颗无限宝石中的至少一颗
with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.

1051
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:04,380
也可以把"遭遇"
Or substitute the word "encounter"

1052
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:05,590
换成"差点被六颗
for "damn near been killed"

1053
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:07,300
无限宝石中的一颗害死"
by one of the six Infinity Stones.

1054
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,370
我没有
Well, I haven't...

1055
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:10,780
但我根本不知道你们在说什么
but I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about.

1056
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:12,240
不管怎样
Regardless,

1057
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:13,970
我们剩的皮姆粒子
we only have enough Pym Particles

1058
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:16,060
只够每人往返一次
for one round-trip each.

1059
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,100
而这些宝石曾在
And these stones have been

1060
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,350
历史上很多不同的地方出现过
in a lot of different places throughout history.

1061
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:20,380
我们的历史
Our history.

1062
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:23,940
所以  我们刚好能去的地方不多  是吧
So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in, yeah?

1063
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,130
所以我们得选好目标
Which means we have to pick our targets.

1064
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,220
没错
Correct.

1065
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,050
那么
So,

1066
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:30,350
先从以太粒子说起
let's start with the Aether.

1067
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:31,930
托尔  你知道些什么
Thor, what do you know?

1068
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:38,560
他睡着了吗
Is he asleep?

1069
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:39,870
不不
No, no.

1070
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:41,400
我肯定他是死了
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

1071
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:45,690
从何说起呢
Where to start?

1072
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:50,740
以太粒子  首先  它不是宝石
The Aether, firstly, is not a stone.

1073
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,780
之前有人把它称为宝石
Someone called it a stone before.

1074
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:58,080
它更像是团愤怒的烂泥
It's more of an angry sludge sort of a thing, so

1075
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,970
得有人纠正一下
someone's gonna need to amend that

1076
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,380
别再那么喊它了
and stop saying that.

1077
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,350
关于以太粒子  有个有趣的故事
Here's an interesting story, though, about the Aether.

1078
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,360
我祖父  很多年前
My grandfather, many years ago...

1079
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:10,140
不得不把宝石藏在了黑暗精灵找不到的地方
had to hide the stone from the Dark Elves.

1080
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:12,900
他们可吓人了
Scary beings.

1081
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:14,970
简呢  其实
So, Jane, actually...

1082
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:16,680
她在这儿呢
There she is.

1083
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:20,560
是啊  简是我的老情人
Yeah, so Jane was an old flame of mine.

1084
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:24,940
她有次把手伸进了一块石头里
You know, she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time...

1085
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,070
以太粒子就进入了她体内
and then the Aether stuck itself inside her...

1086
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:30,130
她就病得很重
and she became very, very sick.

1087
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:32,090
我不得不把她带回阿斯加德
And so I had to take her to Asgard,

1088
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:33,340
我的家乡
which is where I'm from...

1089
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,140
我们只能想办法治好她
and we had to try and fix her.

1090
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:36,640
我们当时在约会
We were dating at the time, you see...

1091
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,120
我还把她介绍给了我妈妈
and I got to introduce her to my mother...

1092
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:43,630
她死了
who's dead and, um...

1093
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,730
然后简和我也分手了
Oh, you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, so...

1094
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:51,400
这种事难免嘛
Yes, these things happen, though. You know?

1095

没什么能天长地久  唯一...
Nothing lasts forever. The only thing that...

1096
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:54,200
-你过来坐下吧  -我没说完呢

1097
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,280
人生中唯一永久不变的

说得太好了  鸡蛋  吃早饭吗
Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?

1100
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,950
不了  我想喝杯血腥玛丽

1101
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,980
奎尔说他是在莫拉格偷走了力量宝石
Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.

1102
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:09,400
-那是个人吗  -不  莫拉格是个星球
- Is that a person? - No, Morag's a planet.

1103
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,450
奎尔才是人
Quill was a person.

1104
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:14,550
星球  是在外太空吗
Like a planet? Like in outer space?

01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:15,910
看啊
Oh, look.

1106
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:18,830
它就像只小狗  乐哈哈的
It's like a little puppy, all happy and everything.

1107

你想去太空吗  想去吗  狗狗
Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy?

1108
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,540
我可以带你去
I'll take you to space.

1109
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:27,020
灭霸在沃密尔星球上找到了灵魂宝石
Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.

1110
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:28,420
沃密尔星球是什么
What is Vormir?

死亡之域
A dominion of death...

1112

六颗宝石

1129
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:19,510
三支队伍

1130
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:21,520
一次机会
one shot.

1131
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:33,030
五年前  我们输了
Five years ago, we lost.

1132
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:35,410

All of us.

我们大部分人是要去熟悉的地方

01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:05,940
但那不代表我们知道会遭遇什么

01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,610

01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:18,620

01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:26,640
大家听到了
You heard the man.

1155
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,330
按键盘吧  绿色快递
Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.

1156
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:30,880

知道啦

1159
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,840

1160
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:39,220
作为保证  这可不怎么样
As promises go, that was pretty lame.

1161
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:43,180
一分钟后见
See ya in a minute.

1162
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,960
好了  我们各有各的任务
All right, we all have our assignments.

1163
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,860
两颗宝石在上城区  一颗在下城区
Two stones uptown, one stone down.

1164
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:43,120
低调点  注意时间
Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock.

1165
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:01,130
随手砸点东西吧
Maybe smash a few things along the way.

1166
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:03,850
我觉得没必要  但随便了
I think it's gratuitous, but whatever.

1167
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:32,850
往那边走可要小心脚下
I'd be careful going that way.

1168
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:34,750
我们刚给地板打了蜡
We just had the floors waxed.

1169
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:42,090
我找斯特兰奇博士
Yeah, I'm looking for Doctor Strange.

1170
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,100
你来早了大概五年
You're about five years too early.

1171
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:48,870
斯蒂芬·斯特兰奇现在正在那边大概
Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery

1172
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:50,680
20个街区处做手术呢
about 20 blocks that way.

1173
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,600
你找他要干什么
What do you want from him?

1174
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:55,730
要那个
That, actually.

1175
01:08:58,750 --> 01:08:59,790
恐怕不行
I'm afraid not.

1176
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:01,610
抱歉  但这不是请求
Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

1177
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:03,050
你不想这么做的
You don't want to do this.

1178
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:05,210
我是不想  但我需要那颗宝石
You're right, I don't. But I need that stone...

1179
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:06,740
我没时间跟你争了
and I don't have time to debate it.

1180
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,290
我们重新开始吧
Let's start over, shall we?

1181
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:29,850
给您的  简女士
For you, Lady Jane.

1182
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:32,930
你们有...裤装吗
Do you have anything with pants?

1183
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:33,850
裤装
Pants?

1184
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,330
算了  这个就行  谢谢
Never mind. These will be fine. Thank you.

1185
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:38,110
-是  女士  -简在那儿
- Yes, milady. - Oh, there's Jane.

1186
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:40,610
好了
All right.

1187
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:43,710
听好了  胖胖
Here's the deal, tubby.

1188
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:44,710
你来迷倒她
You're gonna charm her,

1189
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:46,050
我拿这个戳倒她
and I'm gonna poke her with this thing

1190
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:48,910
抽走现实宝石  然后就麻溜走人
and extract the Reality Stone, and get gone lickety-split.

1191
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:51,390
我马上回来  好吗
I'll be right back, okay?

1192
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:53,510
酒窖就在这边
The wine cellar is just down here.

1193
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:56,390
我父亲以前藏了几大桶的俄科尼麦芽酒
My father used to have this huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

1194
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:58,540
我去碗碟室看看有没有外带杯
I'll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cups.

1195
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:00,550
你不是已经喝醉了吗
Aren't you drunk enough already?

1196
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:08,610
麻烦你给洛基送点汤过去
If you could send Loki some soup.

1197
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:09,240
是  陛下
Yes, milady.

1198
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,450
叫我们的图书管理员
And ask our librarians

1199
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:13,390
去天文区拿几卷书来
to pull some volumes from the astronomy shelf.

1200
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:21,020
那个贵气的女人是谁
Who's the fancy broad?

1201
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:23,530
我妈妈
That's my mother.

1202
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:25,740
她今天会死
She dies today.

1203
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:28,620
是今天吗
That is today?

1204
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:37,870
我做不到
I can't do this. I can't do this.

1205
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,630
我不该来的
I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.

1206
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:41,250
这是个坏主意
It's a bad idea!

1207
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:42,520
-过来  -不不
- Come here. - No, no, no.

1208
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,190
我觉得我恐慌发作了
I think I'm having a panic attack.

1209
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:46,570
-过来  -我不该来的
- Come here. - I shouldn't be here.

1210
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:47,510
-这里  -这不妙
- Right here. - This is bad.

1211
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,860
你以为只有你失去了人吗
You think you're the only one who lost people?

1212
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:51,550
你以为我们在干什么
What do you think we're doing here?

1213
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:53,860
我失去了我唯一曾拥有过的家庭
I lost the only family I ever had.

1214
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:56,830
奎尔  格鲁特  德拉克斯  触角妹
Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna...

1215
01:10:56,830 --> 01:10:57,940
都没了
all gone.

1216
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:00,450
我理解你想你妈妈
I get you miss your mom...

1217
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:01,960
但她死了
but she's gone.

1218
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,120
真死了
Really gone.

1219
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:06,320
但还有很多人只是不在了
And there are plenty of people who are only kind of gone...

1220
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:07,900
你可以帮他们
and you can help them.

1221
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:10,130
所以这个要求过分吗
So, is it too much to ask

1222
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:12,120
把你胡子里的食物渣子掸掉
that you brush the crumbs out of your beard...

1223
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:14,510
去哄那个漂亮妞
make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants...

1224
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:17,930
趁她不备  吸走无限宝石
and when she's not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone...

1225
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:20,040
然后帮我找回家人
and help me get my family back?

1226
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:21,960
好
Okay.

1227
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,750
你哭了吗
Are you crying?

1228
01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:25,210
没有
No.

1229
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:28,300
对
Yes.

1230
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,860
我觉得我要不行了
I feel like I'm losing it.

1231
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:30,860
振作起来
Get it together!

1232
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:32,050
你可以的
You can do this.

1233
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:34,560
你可以的
You can do this.

1234
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:38,640
好吗
All right?

01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:40,060
我可以的
Yes, I can.

1236
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:40,980
很好
Good.

1237
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,610
我可以的
I can do this. I can do this.

1238
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:47,820
我做不到
I can't do this.

1239
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,840
好了  女人杀手  她现在就一个人
All right, heartbreaker, she's alone.

1240
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,070
我们的机会来了
This is our shot.

1241
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:52,320
托尔
Thor?

1242
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,200
托尔
Thor!

1243
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,130
好  降下来  小蓝
All right, bring it down, Blue.

1244
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:08,300
对准那条线  没错  再往下
Right on that line. That's it. Down, down.

1245

沃密尔星球的坐标已输入

他们只要不跌出来就行
All they have to do is not fall out.

1257

1258

好吧
Okay, so, uh...

1259
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:07,290
我们就等着这个奎尔出现
we just wait around for this Quill guy to show up...

1260
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:09,400
然后他就会带我们找到力量宝石  是吗
and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?

1261
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:11,650
我们找掩护吧
Let's take cover.

1262
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:15,760
2014年时  我们不是唯一在找宝石的人
We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.

1263
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:17,380
等等  你在说什么呢
Wait a minute. What are you talking about right now?

1264
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:18,990
还有谁在找宝石
Who else is looking for these stones?

1265
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:23,290
我父亲
My father...

1266
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:24,920
我姐姐
my sister...

1267
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:26,840
和我

还有你
And you?

1269
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:31,420
你现在在哪
Where are you right now?

1270
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:01,540
不客气
You're welcome.

1271
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,040
我没叫你帮忙
I didn't ask for your help.

1272
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,830
但你总需要我帮
And yet, you always need it.

1273
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:12,730
起来  父亲要我们回飞船上
Get up. Father wants us back on the ship.

1274
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:13,460
为什么
Why?

1275
01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:15,720
他找到了一颗无限宝石
He's found an Infinity Stone.

1276
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:20,930
在哪
Where?

1277
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:23,770
在一颗叫莫格拉的星球上

1278
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,270
父亲的计划总算开始运作了
Father's plan is finally in motion.

1279
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:29,250
一颗宝石可不比六颗  星云
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

1280
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:30,480
这是个开始
It's a start.

1281
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,780
如果他能拿到全部...
If he gets all of them...

1282
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:47,390
罗南已找到了力量宝石

1283
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:49,270
我要派你们去他的飞船上
I'm dispatching you to his ship.

1284
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:50,710
他不会高兴的
He won't like that.

1285
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:52,840
他不配合就得死
His alternative is death.

1286
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:56,010
罗南的执迷
Ronan's obsession...

1287
01:14:57,070 --> 01:14:59,010
影响了他的判断力
clouds his judgment.

1288
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,430
我们不会让你失望的  父亲
We will not fail you, Father.

1289
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:08,020
是啊  你不会的
No, you won't.

1290
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,480
我发誓
I swear...

1291
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,740
我会让你骄傲的
I will make you proud.

1292
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:27,470
我们就等着这个奎尔出现
...we just wait around for this Quill guy to show up...

1293
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:29,540
然后他就会带我们找到力量宝石  是吗
and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?

1294
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:31,710
我们找掩护吧
Let's take cover.

1295
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:36,210
2014年时  我们不是唯一在找宝石的人
We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.

1296
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:39,300
那是谁
Who was that?

1297
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:40,530
我不知道
I don't know.

1298
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:42,890
我头痛欲裂  我不知道
My head is splitting. I don't know.

1299
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:47,560
她的突触驱动可能在打斗中损伤了
Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle.

1300
01:15:57,790 --> 01:15:59,490
把她带上我的飞船
Bring her to my ship.

1301
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:08,300
快点吧  队长
Better hustle, Cap.

1302
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:10,220
这边看上去像是快要完事了
Things look like they're just about wrapped up here.

1303
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:12,380
收到  我正在往电梯去
Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now.

1304
01:16:18,690 --> 01:16:20,430
如果你们不介意
If it's all the same to you...

1305
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:24,430
我现在想来一杯
I'll have that drink now.

1306
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,220
好  把他拉起来
All right, get him on his feet.

1307
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:29,060
我们稍后再傻站着摆姿势吧
We can all stand around posing up a storm later.

1308
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:31,270
对了  你们可以收拾一下
By the way, feel free to clean up.

1309
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:34,120
罗杰斯先生  我差点忘了  那身战衣
Mr. Rogers, I almost forgot that that suit...

1310
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,920
太不衬你的屁股了
did nothing for your ass.

1311
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,370
你非得看吗  托尼
No one asked you to look, Tony.

1312
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:37,960
真荒唐
It's ridiculous.

1313
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,440
我觉得你很帅  队长
I think you look great, Cap.

1314
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:42,460
在我看来  那就是美国屁股
As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass.

1315
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:44,300
魔杖归谁
Who gets the, uh, magic wand?

1316
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,030
突击队正在赶来收走它
S.T.R.I.K.E. Team's coming to secure it.

1317
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,000
那个交给我们吧
We can take that off your hands.

1318
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,710
请吧
By all means.

1319
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,010
小心哦
Careful with that thing.

1320
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:05,150
是啊  除非你想被抹除思想
Yeah, unless you want your mind erased.

1321
01:17:05,150 --> 01:17:06,280
而且可不好玩
And not in a fun way.

1322
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,490
我们一定小心
We promise to be careful.

1323
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:08,490
他们是谁
Who are these guys?

1324
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:10,060
他们是神盾局的
They are S.H.I.E.L.D.

1325
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:13,290
但其实是九头蛇的  但我们当时不知道
Well, actually Hydra, but we didn't know that yet.

1326
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:15,100
真的吗  你们不知道
Seriously? You didn't? I mean,

1327
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:17,210
他们一看就不像好人啊
they look like bad guys.

1328
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:18,960
你虽然个头小  但好聒噪
You're small, but you're talking loud.

1329
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,880
这就下去协调搜救工作

这就下去协调搜救工作

1332
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,160
闭嘴
Shut up.

1333
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:29,340
好  该你上了  小伙计

让开

1338
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:50,910
伙计
Buddy!

1339
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:53,280
你怎么想的  已达到承载上限了
What do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached.

1340
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:53,950
走楼梯吧

1341
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:56,060
是啊  别别
Yeah. Stop, stop.

1342
01:17:58,830 --> 01:18:01,690
"走楼梯"  讨厌楼梯
"Take the stairs." Hate the stairs.

1343

好了  队长  权杖在电梯里

1351
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:27,610

我以为你去协调搜救行动了

1358
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:54,080
长官  我不懂

1359
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:58,350
我们收到消息  可能有人会企图偷它
We got word there may be an attempt to steal it.

1360
01:18:58,350 --> 01:18:59,380
抱歉  队长
Sorry, Cap.

1361
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:01,630
我们不能把权杖给你
We can't give you the scepter.

那是AXE香氛吗

对  我桌子里常备一罐应急的  放松啦

1377
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:11,550
亚历山大·皮尔斯

1378
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:13,920
他是尼克·弗瑞背后老大的老大
He's the man above the folks behind Nick Fury.

1379
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:15,510
我的朋友喊我部长先生
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.

1380
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:18,120
我得请你把那位犯人交给我
I'm gonna have to ask you to turn that prisoner over to me.

1381
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:20,140
洛基会去向奥丁做个交待的
Loki will be answering to Odin himself.

1382
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:21,310
不  他得向我们做交待

1383
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:22,520
我们审过了再给奥丁
Odin can have what's left.

1384

我还要拿走那个箱子

1385
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:26,020
那七十多年来都是神盾局的财产
That's been S.H.I.E.L.D. property for over 70 years.

1386
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:27,340
交出箱子  斯塔克

这边情况有点麻烦了  快点的

我不打算争论这里谁的权力更高

你保证你不会死吗
You promise me you won't die?

1391
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:36,780
我们只是要让我稍稍心律失常
We're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

1392
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:38,350
那听上去很暴力啊
That doesn't sound mild.

1393
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:39,280
我需要那个箱子
I need the case.

1394
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,830
我知道你权力挺大的  我只是说
I know you got a lot of pull, I'm just saying,

1395
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:42,080
-管辖权...  -好吧  那给我箱子
- jurisdiction... - Okay, then give me the case.

1396
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,120
管辖权...
Well, jurisdiction...

1397
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,560
交出来
Hand it over.

1398
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:45,660
动手  朗
Do it, Lang!

1399
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:46,460
手拿开
Get your hands off me.

1400
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:48,360
快没时间了  拔线
Window's closing. Pull my pin.

1401
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:49,780
来了
Here goes!

1402
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,320
-斯塔克  -斯塔克
- Stark? - Stark?

1403
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:56,970
他在抽搐  给他点空间
He's convulsing. Give him air!

1404
01:20:56,970 --> 01:20:58,700
-医务人员  -医务人员
- Medic! - Medic!

1405
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:00,500
他们需要帮助
Give these guys some help.

1406
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:01,910
说话啊
Speak to me.

1407
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:04,420
斯塔克  是你的胸口机器吗
Stark, is it your chest machine?

1408
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:08,380
呼吸
Breathe, breathe.

1409
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:14,780
好样的  巷子里见
Good job. Meet me in the alley.

1410
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:16,180
我去找点吃的
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

1411
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:23,940
不走楼梯
No stairs!

1412
01:21:31,210 --> 01:21:32,790
拜托  斯塔克  保持清醒
Come on, Stark, stay with us.

1413
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,710
我要试个办法  好吗
I'm going to try something. Okay?

1414
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:35,070
我也不知道行不行
I have no idea if it's going to work.

1415
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:38,260
好啊
Yes!

1416
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,490
非常行啊
That worked a treat.

1417
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,640
哥们  真疯狂
Dude, that was so crazy.

1418
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,160
我完全不知道那行不行
I had no idea if that was gonna work.

1419
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:44,080
-箱子呢  -箱子
- The case. - The case is, uh...

1420
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:46,580
箱子呢  洛基呢
Where's the case? Where's Loki?

1421
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:48,250
洛基
Loki!

1422
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:49,690
那不符合计划  是吧
That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?

1423
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:50,920
我们搞砸了
Oh, we blew it.

1424
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,550
洛基
Loki?

1425
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:56,300
托尼  怎么回事
Tony, what's going on?

1426
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:58,550
告诉我你找到魔方了
Tell me you found that Cube.

1427
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,560
开什么玩笑
You gotta be shitting me.

1428
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,480
看到洛基了  14楼
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.

1429
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:10,780
我不是洛基
I'm not Loki...

1430
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:16,030
我也不想伤害你
and I don't wanna hurt you.

1431
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:26,100
我可以和你耗一整天
I can do this all day.

1432
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:27,250
我知道
Yeah, I know.

1433
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,580
我知道
I know.

1434
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:02,870
你从哪拿到的
Where did you get this?

1435
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:14,600
巴基
Bucky

1436
01:23:14,610 --> 01:23:15,420
还
is

1437
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,590
活着
alive.

1438
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:20,970
什么
What?

1439
01:23:36,130 --> 01:23:37,780
确实是美国屁股
That is America's ass.

1440
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:43,610
-拜托了  -对不起
- Please, please. - I'm sorry,

1441
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:45,240
我帮不了你  布鲁斯
I can't help you, Bruce.

1442
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:47,430
如果我交出时间宝石
If I give up the Time Stone

1443
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:49,640
帮助你的现实  就是毁了我的现实
to help your reality, I'm dooming my own.

1444
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,180
恕我直言
With all due respect, all right...

1445
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:54,550
我觉得科学并不支持你这个说法
I'm not sure the science really supports that.

1446
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:01,570
无限宝石
The Infinity Stones

1447
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:04,430
创造了你所感知的时间流
create what you experience as the flow of time.

1448
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:06,220
如果拿走一颗宝石
Remove one of the stones...

1449
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:08,140
就会产生支流
and that flow splits.

1450
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:10,980
这或许对你的现实有好处
Now, this may benefit your reality...

1451
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:13,690
但对我新的这个  就不好了
but my new one, not so much.

1452
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:15,790
在这个新的支流现实里
In this new branch reality...

1453
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:17,330
没有了我们对抗
without our chief weapon

1454
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:19,070
黑暗力量的首要武器
against the forces of darkness...

1455
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:21,130
我们的世界会被颠覆
our world would be overrun.

1456
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:22,870
数百万人会蒙受灾难
Millions will suffer.

1457
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:24,620
告诉我  博士
So, tell me, Doctor.

1458
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,300
你的科学能阻止这一切吗
Can your science prevent all that?

1459
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:28,200
不能
No...

1460
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:30,560
但我们可以抹除它
but we can erase it.

1461
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,350
因为我们用完宝石后
Because once we're done with the stones...

1462
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:34,600
我们可以把每一颗拿回原来的时间点
we can return each one to its own timeline...

1463
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,230
放回被拿走的那一刻
at the moment it was taken.

1464
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:38,630
这样  从时间上讲
So, chronologically...

1465
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,680
在那个现实里
in that reality...

1466
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:44,800
它就根本没被拿走过
it never left.

1467
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:50,350
是啊  但你漏掉了最重要的部分
Yes, but you're leaving out the most important part.

1468
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:56,870
要还回宝石  你们得能幸存下来
In order to return the stones, you have to survive.

1469
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:59,820
我们会的  我会的  我保证
We will. I will. I promise.

1470
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:02,780
我不能为了一句承诺拿这个现实冒险
I can't risk this reality on a promise.

1471
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:06,720
至尊法师有责任
It's the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme

1472
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,740
保护时间宝石
to protect the Time Stone.

1473
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:11,330
那斯特兰奇为什么把它交了出去
Then why the hell did Strange give it away?

1474
01:25:12,890 --> 01:25:13,930
你说什么
What did you say?

1475
01:25:13,930 --> 01:25:16,880
斯特兰奇  他把宝石交给了灭霸
Strange. He gave it away. He gave it to Thanos.

1476
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:18,840
-自愿的吗  -是的
- Willingly? - Yes.

1477
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:24,280
-为什么  -我不知道
- Why? - I have no idea.

1478
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,840
或许他错了
Maybe he made a mistake.

1479
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:37,610
或是我错了
Or I did.

1480
01:25:57,770 --> 01:26:00,300
斯特兰奇将成为我们中最优秀的
Strange is meant to be the best of us.

1481
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:03,170
所以他那么做肯定是有原因的
So, he must've done it for a reason.

1482
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:05,590
你恐怕是对的
I fear you might be right.

1483
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:11,310
谢谢
Thank you.

1484
01:26:17,790 --> 01:26:19,650
我指望你了  布鲁斯
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1485
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:22,690
我们都指望你了
We all are.

1486
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:44,800
运行诊断
Run diagnostics.

1487
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,090
给我看她的记忆文件
Show me her memory file.

1488
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:51,640
大人  文件似乎凌乱了
Sire, the file appears entangled.

1489
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:54,810
虽然有段记忆  但不属于她
It was a memory, but not hers.

1490
01:26:55,870 --> 01:26:58,560
还有另一个意识在与她共享网络
There's another consciousness sharing her network.

1491
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:00,650
另一个星云
Another Nebula.

1492
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:04,030
不可能
Impossible.

1493
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:06,860
这个二重身有时间戳
This duplicate carries a time stamp...

1494
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,870
是九年后的
from nine years in the future.

1495
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:16,960
另一个星云在哪
Where is this other Nebula?

1496
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:20,500
在我们太阳系里的莫格拉上
In our solar system on Morag.

1497
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,730
你能读取她吗
Can you access her?

1498
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:24,550
能  她俩是相连的
Yes, the two are linked.

1499
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:27,130
搜索那个二重身的记忆
Search the duplicate's memories...

1500
01:27:27,530 --> 01:27:29,470
找无限宝石
for Infinity Stones.

1501
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:34,200
而这些宝石曾在
And these stones have been

1502
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,410
历史上很多不同的地方出现过
in a lot of different places throughout history.

1503
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:37,770
我们的历史  所以
Our history. So,

1504
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:40,370
我们刚好能去的地方不多  是吧
not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in, yeah?

1505
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:42,580
所以我们得选好目标
Which means we have to pick our targets.

1506
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:44,230
-没错  -定格
- Correct. - Freeze image.

1507
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:47,570
地球人
Terrans.

1508
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:50,030
复仇者
Avengers.

1509
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:52,780
无法无天的讨厌鬼
Unruly wretches.

1510
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:54,660
那个倒影是什么
What's that reflection?

1511
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:57,660
放大它  乌木喉
Amplify this, Maw.

1512
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:01,920
我不懂
I don't understand.

1513
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:08,320
两个星云
Two Nebulas.

1514
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:11,050
不  是一个星云
No. The same Nebula...

1515
01:28:11,610 --> 01:28:13,390
来自两个时间
from two different times.

1516
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:16,320
设置航向去莫格拉
Set course for Morag.

1517
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,350
并扫描那个二重身的记忆
And scan the duplicate's memories.

1518
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:21,850
我想看到一切
I wanna see everything.

1519
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:33,590
女士们  稍后见
My ladies, I'll see you after.

1520
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:35,370
你们先去吧
I'll see you after. Go on ahead.

1521
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:50,720
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1522
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:53,570
天呐
Oh, God!

1523
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:56,200
偷偷摸摸这种事最好还是交给你弟弟
You're better off leaving the sneaking to your brother.

1524
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,700
我没偷偷摸摸  我就是出来走走
No, I wasn't sneaking. I was just going for a walk.

1525
01:28:58,700 --> 01:28:59,570
你穿的是什么啊
What are you wearing?

1526
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:02,270
我总穿这件的  我最喜欢了
I always wear this. It's one of my favorites.

1527
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:07,830
你的眼睛怎么了
What's wrong with your eye?

1528
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:08,670
我的眼睛
Oh, my eye.

1529
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:10,960
记得海拉根战役吗
Remember the, uh, Battle of Harokin...

1530
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,740
我被大刀击中了脸
when I got hit in the face with the broadsword?

1531
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:20,250
你根本不是我认识的托尔  是吧
You're not the Thor I know at all, are you?

1532
01:29:20,510 --> 01:29:21,710
我是的
Yes, I am.

1533
01:29:22,850 --> 01:29:25,500
看来未来对你很不好  是吧
The future hasn't been kind to you, has it?

1534
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,670
我没说我是未来来的
I didn't say I was from the future.

1535
01:29:28,150 --> 01:29:30,300
我是被女巫养大的  孩子
I was raised by witches, boy.

1536
01:29:31,610 --> 01:29:34,300
我看东西不光靠眼睛  你知道的
I see with more than eyes, you know that.

1537
01:29:35,990 --> 01:29:38,490
是啊  我就是从未来来的
Yeah, I'm totally from the future.

1538
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:40,490
是啊  亲爱的
Yes, you are, honey.

1539
01:29:40,490 --> 01:29:42,180
我真的需要跟你谈谈
I really need to talk to you.

1540
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:43,230
我们可以谈谈
We can talk.

1541
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,170
他的脑袋在这边
His head was over there...

1542
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,510
他的身体在另一边
and his body over there...

1543
01:30:13,570 --> 01:30:15,930
有什么意义呢  我太迟了
I mean, what was the point? I was too late.

1544
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:18,350
我就傻站在那里
I was just standing there.

1545
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:21,070
一个拿着斧头的白痴
Some idiot with an axe.

1546
01:30:21,070 --> 01:30:23,230
你才不是白痴
Now, you're no idiot.

1547
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:25,480
你不是来这儿了吗

向阿斯加德最睿智的人寻求建议

1549

01:30:29,870 --> 01:30:31,230

1553
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:35,750
这有点残忍了吧
That's a little bit harsh.

1554

1555
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,660
跟其他人一样
Just like everyone else.

1556
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:43,410
我不是该与众不同的吗
I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, am I?

1557
01:30:44,430 --> 01:30:47,750
每个人都会辜负他人的期待  托尔
Everyone fails at who they're supposed to be, Thor.

1558
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:51,090
衡量一个人  一个英雄的标准

是他们能把真实的自己做得多好

我真的好想你  妈妈

1564
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,160
不  儿子  你不用说

1565
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:21,260
你是来修复你的未来的  不是我的

1566
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:24,580
-这就是关于你的未来  -那我管不着
- This is about your future.  - It's none of my business.

1567

我拿到了  我们得走了

1570
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:37,340
不  这已是恩赐
No, this was a gift.

1571
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:40,180
你去做你该成为的那个人吧
Now you go and be the man you're meant to be.

1572
01:31:41,150 --> 01:31:42,240
我爱你  妈妈
I love you, Mom.

1573
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:43,560
我爱你
I love you.

1574
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:49,600
吃点蔬菜吧
And eat a salad.

1575
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:52,020
好了  我们得走了
Come on, we gotta go.

1576
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:53,320
-再见  -三
- Goodbye. - Three...

1577
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:54,980
-二  -不  等等
- Two... - No, wait!

1578
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,300
什么情况啊
What am I looking at?

1579
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:01,490
有时得需要点时间
Sometimes it takes a second.

1580
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:11,960
我还有资格
I'm still worthy.

1581
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:14,840
天呐
Oh, boy.

1582
01:32:16,610 --> 01:32:18,670
-再见  妈妈  -再见
- Goodbye, Mom. - Goodbye.

1583
01:32:57,730 --> 01:32:59,010
所以  他是个白痴吗
So, he's an idiot?

1584
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:01,840
对
Yeah.

1585
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:11,690
那是什么
What's that?

1586
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:13,350
贼的工具
The tool of a thief.

1587
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:25,510
按说这时候就会有尖刺冒出来
This is the part where you know, spikes come out...

1588
01:33:25,510 --> 01:33:27,130
上面还插着骷髅
with skeletons on the end of them and everything.

1589
01:33:27,130 --> 01:33:27,930
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

1590
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:29,300
当你闯入什么
When you break into a place called

1591
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:30,850
"力量宝石神殿"时
"The Temple of the Power Stone"...

1592
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:32,310
肯定会有一堆陷阱的
there's gonna be a bunch of booby traps.

1593
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:34,170
-天呐  -好吧  行啊  你去吧
- Oh, my God. - Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1594
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,620
我并不一直是如此的
I wasn't always like this.

1595
01:34:10,510 --> 01:34:11,410
我也一样
Me either.

1596
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:14,870
但我们只能尽力而为了  是吧
But we work with what we got, right?

1597
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:19,540
我们同步吧
Let's sync up.

1598
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:23,970
三  二  一
Three, two, one.

1599
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:38,710
你杀了数万亿生灵
You murdered trillions!

1600
01:34:38,710 --> 01:34:40,320
你应该感激

1601
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:43,860
宝石在哪

没了
Gone.

1603
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,260
化成原子了
Reduced to atoms.

1604
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:49,160
你两天前还用过的
You used them two days ago!

1605
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:52,180
我用宝石摧毁了宝石
I used the stones to destroy the stones.

1606
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:54,390
差点要了我的命
It nearly killed me.

1607
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:56,210
但大业已成
But the work is done.

1608
01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:58,670
注定会完成的
It always will be.

1609
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:03,130
我是宿命
I am inevitable.

1610
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,010
你对他们做了什么
What did you do to them?

1611
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:07,510
没什么
Nothing.

1612
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:09,800
还没做呢

他们不是想阻止我要在

1614
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:15,310
我们的时间里做的事

1615
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:17,620
他们是想撤销我已在
They're trying to undo something

1616
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:19,540
他们的时间里做了的事
I've already done in theirs.

1617
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:20,770
宝石
The stones.

1618

1626
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:52,550
也许我过去对你太残酷了
Perhaps I treated you too harshly.

1627
01:35:56,870 --> 01:35:59,600
那就是实现了命运
And that is destiny fulfilled.

1628
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,150
大人
Sire...

1629
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:02,770

1650
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:14,530
饶了我吧  史蒂夫
You know what? Give me a break, Steve.

1651

我刚被绿巨人砸了脑袋

你说我们只有一次机会的
You said that we had one shot.

1653
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:19,450
这就是我们的机会
This was our shot.

1654
01:37:19,450 --> 01:37:20,700
我们试了  没机会了
We shot it. It's shot.

1655
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:21,530
六颗宝石  不然就不行
Six stones or nothing.

1656

六颗宝石  不然就不行
It was six stones or nothing.

1658
01:37:23,410 --> 01:37:24,000
你在重复自己的话

01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,710
你才在重复自己的话
You're repeating yourself. You're repeating yourself.

1660
01:37:25,710 --> 01:37:26,710
-不  -哥们

1661
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:28,290
-行了  -你当初就不想进行时间盗窃

1665
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:33,550

1666
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:35,550
没了  没有其他选择

1667
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:36,550
没法重来
There's no do-overs.

1668
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:39,090
我们别想去别的地方了  我们只剩一剂粒子了
We're not going anywhere else. We have one particle left.

1669
01:37:39,090 --> 01:37:40,050

Each.

1670
01:37:40,050 --> 01:37:42,500
就这些了  好吗  我们用了

再见了  别想回家了
bye-bye, you're not going home.

1672
01:37:43,850 --> 01:37:45,540
如果我们不试试
Yeah, well, if we don't try...

1673
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:47,850
那别人也都别想回家了
then no one else is going home, either.

1674
01:37:47,850 --> 01:37:48,750
我知道了
I got it.

1675
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:51,610
还有别的办法能拿到宇宙魔方
There's another way to retake the Tesseract

1676
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:54,010
并拿到更多粒子

1677
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:56,180
回忆一下

它们都在...我大致知道是什么时候

1681
01:38:06,620 --> 01:38:08,000
-多大致  -你们在说什么
- How vague? - What are you talking about?

1682
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,710
我们去哪
Where are we going?

1683
01:38:08,710 --> 01:38:10,420
-我确定它们在那里  -什么它们

1684
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:11,860
-我们要干什么  -我也知道我怎么知道的
- What are we doing? - And I know how I know.

1685
01:38:14,050 --> 01:38:15,410
伙计们  怎么回事
Guys, what is it?

1686
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:17,880
看来我们得即兴发挥了
Looks like we're improvising.

1687
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:19,300
-好  -什么即兴发挥

1693
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:27,960
-喂喂  -1970

1694
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:29,590

1699
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,930
但不成功  你们就回不来了

01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:45,980
相信
I do.

1703
01:38:47,290 --> 01:38:48,360
你决定
Your call.

1704
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:50,480
走吧
Here we go.

1705
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:10,750
伙计  做爱  不作战
Hey, man! Make love, not war.

1706
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:19,650
你显然不是真在这里出生的吧
Clearly you weren't actually born here, right?

1707
01:39:19,650 --> 01:39:21,100
是我的概念的诞生地
The idea of me was.

1708
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:23,700
好吧  如果你是神盾局
Right. Well, imagine you're S.H.I.E.L.D...

1709
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:27,390
运作一个准法西斯情报机构
running a quasi-fascistic intelligence organization...

1710
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:29,730
你会把它藏在哪
where do you hide it?

1711
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:31,440
藏在眼皮下
In plain sight.

1712
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:01,690
祝你任务顺利  队长
Good luck on your mission, Captain.

1713

祝你项目顺利  博士

1714
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:08,890
你新来的吗
You new here?

1715
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:12,730
并不是
Not exactly.

1716
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:21,200
快点
Come on, you bastard.

1717
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:29,040
找到了
Gotcha.

1718
01:40:47,030 --> 01:40:48,140
又有戏了
Back in the game.

1719
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:52,810
阿尼姆  是你吗
Arnim, you in there?

1720
01:40:53,370 --> 01:40:54,230
阿尼姆
Arnim?

1721
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:03,200
门在这边  伙计
The door is this way, pal.

1722
01:41:04,340 --> 01:41:05,700
是啊
Oh, yeah.

1723
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:07,430
找佐拉博士呢  看到他了吗
Looking for Doctor Zola, have you seen him?

1724
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:10,870
嗯  佐拉博士  我谁都没看见
Yeah, Doctor Zola. No, I haven't seen a soul.

1725
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:13,540
请原谅
Pardon me.

1726
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:15,630
我认识你吗
Do I know you?

1727
01:41:17,730 --> 01:41:18,920
不  先生

Shake that, don't pull it.

1736
01:41:35,390 --> 01:41:36,390
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}拉手指放屁

1737
01:41:36,330 --> 01:41:37,440
嗯
Yeah.

1738
01:41:39,330 --> 01:41:41,630
你脸色不太好啊  波茨
You look a little green around the gills, there, Potts.

1739
01:41:41,630 --> 01:41:43,530
我没事  就是干活儿累了
I'm fine. Just long hours.

1740
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:45,280
想去呼吸下新鲜空气吗
You wanna get some air?

1741

要拿上你的箱子吗
Need your briefcase?

1745
01:41:58,690 --> 01:42:00,760
你不是那种垮掉的一代吧  波茨
You're not one of those beatniks, are you, Potts?

1746
01:42:07,110 --> 01:42:08,890
-喂  -皮姆博士
- Hello? - Doctor Pym?

1747
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:11,530
你打的是这个号码  没错
That would be the number that you called, yes.

1748
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:13,870
我是运输部的史蒂文斯上尉
This is Captain Stevens from shipping.

1749
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:15,100
这里有个给你的包裹
We have a package for you.

1750
01:42:15,450 --> 01:42:16,500
拿上来吧
Bring it up.

1751
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:18,400
问题就在这里  先生  我们没法拿
That's the thing, sir, we can't.

1752
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:22,240
我不懂  那不是你的工作吗
I'm confused. I thought that was your job.

1753
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:23,610
就是...
Well, it's just...

1754
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,170
先生  这盒子在发光
Sir, the box is glowing...

1755
01:42:25,170 --> 01:42:26,340
老实说
and to be honest,

1756
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:28,580
几个邮递员也不太舒服
some of our mail guys aren't feeling that great.

1757
01:42:28,630 --> 01:42:30,220
他们没打开它吧
They didn't open it, did they?

1758
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:32,370
他们开了  您最好赶紧来
Yeah, they did. You better get down here.

1759
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:35,160
借过  让开
Excuse me! Out of the way!

1760
01:43:02,670 --> 01:43:05,650
鲜花和德国泡菜  今晚有重要约会吗
So, flowers and sauerkraut. You got a big date tonight?

1761
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:08,360
我妻子要生了
My wife's expecting.

1762
01:43:08,590 --> 01:43:11,080
平时我又老泡办公室
And too much time at the office.

1763
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:14,390
恭喜
Congratulations.

1764
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:16,330
-谢谢  替我拿下  -好
- Thanks. Hold this, will ya? - Yeah, sure.

1765
01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:19,790
-她怀多久了  -不知道
- How far along is she? - I don't know.

1766
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:22,770
反正她现在
She's at the point

1767
01:43:22,770 --> 01:43:24,630
受不了我嚼东西的声音
where she can't stand the sound of my chewing.

1768
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:27,720
看来我又得去餐具室吃晚饭了
I guess I'll be eating dinner in the pantry again.

1769
01:43:29,150 --> 01:43:30,220
我有个女儿
I have a little girl.

1770
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:31,600
是女儿就好了
A girl would be nice.

1771
01:43:31,860 --> 01:43:34,180
那样她比较不太可能变成我这样
Less of a chance she'd turn out exactly like me.

1772
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:36,080
那有什么不好的
What'd be so awful about that?

1773
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:37,870
这么说吧  我很少能
Let's just say that the greater good

1774
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:41,980
把大局放在自利之上
has rarely outweighed my own self-interest.

1775
01:43:45,540 --> 01:43:46,750
你从未见过这两人吗
And you've never seen these two men before?

1776
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:49,050
没  我眼神很刁的  他俩看上去很可疑
No, I've got an eye for this. The two of them looked fishy.

1777
01:43:49,050 --> 01:43:49,800
可以描述一下吗
Can you describe them?

1778
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:51,550
其中一个留了嬉皮士胡子
One of them had a hippie beard.

1779
01:43:51,550 --> 01:43:53,090
嬉皮士  是比吉斯乐队还是蒙格·杰里那种
Hippie. Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

1780
01:43:53,090 --> 01:43:54,340
绝对是蒙格·杰里
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1781
01:43:54,340 --> 01:43:55,090
我是切斯特
Yeah, this is Chesler.

1782
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:57,180
所有可调动宪兵前往地下六层
I need every available MP to sublevel six.

1783
01:43:57,180 --> 01:43:58,670
可能有人闯入
We have a potential breach.

1784
01:44:16,410 --> 01:44:17,450
我说了叫他们回来
I said bring them in.

1785
01:44:17,450 --> 01:44:18,620
他们在试了  长官
They're trying, ma'am,

1786
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:20,290
但布拉多克的小队被雷击阻拦了
but Braddock's unit has been stopped by lightning strikes.

1787
01:44:20,290 --> 01:44:21,500
老天爷啊
Oh, for the love of...

1788
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:22,980
我会看看天气预报的
I'll look at the weather projections.

1789
01:44:47,110 --> 01:44:49,220
这可不是雷击
It's not lightning strikes we're looking at.

1790
01:45:00,490 --> 01:45:02,200
名字想得怎么样了
So, where you at with names?

1791
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:05,440
如果是男孩  我妻子想叫埃蒙泽
Well, if it's a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo.

1792
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:08,480
还是再考虑考虑吧  还有时间呢
Might wanna let that stew awhile. You got time.

1793
01:45:10,590 --> 01:45:11,780
我问问你
Let me ask you a question.

1794
01:45:13,010 --> 01:45:14,280
你孩子出生时
When your kid was born,

1795
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:16,380
你紧张吗
were you nervous?

1796
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:17,240
可紧张了
Wildly.

1797
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:19,800
-是啊  -你觉得自己够格吗
- Yeah. - Did you feel qualified?

1798
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:21,680
你知道
Like you had any idea

1799
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:23,720
要怎么成功操作那玩意吗
how to successfully operate that thing?

1800
01:45:23,730 --> 01:45:26,770
我真的是一边干一边学的
I literally pieced it together as I went along.

1801
01:45:26,770 --> 01:45:29,010
我回想了我爸爸是怎么做的
I thought about what my dad did.

1802
01:45:29,610 --> 01:45:32,430
我老爸  他什么问题都用皮带解决
My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt.

1803
01:45:32,530 --> 01:45:34,530
我以前觉得我爸爸对我很严厉
I thought my dad was tough on me.

1804
01:45:34,530 --> 01:45:35,820
而如今回想起来
And now, looking back on it,

1805
01:45:35,820 --> 01:45:37,220
我只记得那些美好的回忆
I just remember the good stuff.

1806
01:45:37,490 --> 01:45:39,270
他偶尔也说过些金句
You know? He did drop the odd pearl.

1807
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:40,810
是吗  比如呢
Yeah? Like what?

1808
01:45:41,790 --> 01:45:44,310
"千金难买寸光阴"
"No amount of money ever bought a second of time."

1809
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:46,810
他很睿智
Smart guy.

1810
01:45:47,210 --> 01:45:48,320
他尽力了
He did his best.

1811
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:51,490
我跟你说  那孩子还没出生
I'll tell you, that kid's not even here yet

1812
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:53,570
我已经愿意为他付出一切了
and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him.

1813
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:03,540
很高兴认识你  波茨
Good to meet you, Potts.

1814
01:46:04,770 --> 01:46:05,790
我也是
Yeah.

1815

霍华德
Howard...

1816
01:46:07,810 --> 01:46:09,250
一切都会没事的
everything's gonna be all right.

1817
01:46:12,230 --> 01:46:13,130
谢谢你
Thank you...

1818
01:46:14,650 --> 01:46:15,680
做的一切
for everything...

1819
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:17,970
为这个国家做的一切
you've done for this country.

1820
01:46:21,450 --> 01:46:22,310
贾维斯
Jarvis.

1821
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:27,400
我们见过那个人吗
Have we ever met that guy?

1822
01:46:29,830 --> 01:46:31,400
您每天会见到很多人  先生
You meet a lot of people, sir.

1823
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:35,150
看着很眼熟
Seems very familiar.

1824
01:46:36,510 --> 01:46:37,660
胡子挺怪的
Weird beard.

1825
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:47,330
你好弱
You're weak.

1826
01:46:47,770 --> 01:46:49,040
我就是你
I'm you.

1827
01:47:06,410 --> 01:47:08,020
你可以阻止这一切
You could stop this.

1828
01:47:08,830 --> 01:47:10,820
你知道你想的
You know you want to.

1829
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,690
你看到未来发生了什么吗
Did you see what happens in the future?

1830
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:17,360
灭霸拿到了灵魂宝石
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1831
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:20,580
你想知道他是怎么拿到的吗
You wanna know how he does that?

1832
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:26,580
你想知道他对你做了什么吗
You wanna know what he does to you?

1833
01:47:26,890 --> 01:47:27,920
够了
That's enough.

1834
01:47:40,610 --> 01:47:42,220
你让我恶心
You disgust me.

1835
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:47,770
但这不代表你毫无用处
But that doesn't mean you're useless.

1836
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:11,380
我看起来怎么样
How do I look?

1837
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:22,050
要不是在这种情况下
Under different circumstances...

1838
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:25,350
这本会很赞的
this would be totally awesome.

1839
01:48:37,630 --> 01:48:39,780
我敢说那浣熊不用爬山
I bet the raccoon didn't have to climb a mountain.

1840
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:42,630
严格说  他也不是浣熊
Technically he's not a raccoon, you know?

1841
01:48:42,630 --> 01:48:44,370
随便  反正他吃垃圾
Whatever. He eats garbage.

If only it were that easy.

1855
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:35,080
你所寻找的就在你面前
What you seek lies in front of you.

1856
01:49:36,850 --> 01:49:39,050
你所害怕的也在那里
As does what you fear.

1857
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:45,760
宝石就在下面
The stone's down there.

1858
01:49:46,820 --> 01:49:48,010
只能给一个人
For one of you.

1859
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:50,390
而另一个
For the other...

1860
01:49:53,410 --> 01:49:55,370
要得到灵魂宝石
In order to take the stone...

1861
01:49:55,370 --> 01:49:57,980
你必须失去自己的珍爱之物
you must lose that which you love.

1862
01:49:59,830 --> 01:50:02,490
永恒的交换
An everlasting exchange.

1863
01:50:04,090 --> 01:50:07,490
以一个灵魂  换一个灵魂
A soul for a soul.

1864
01:50:10,760 --> 01:50:11,750
你好啊
How's it going?

1865
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:16,710
老天
Jesus.

1866
01:50:17,270 --> 01:50:19,300
这可能都是他编的
Maybe he's making this shit up.

1867
01:50:19,850 --> 01:50:20,760
不
No.

1868
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:23,170
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

1869
01:50:23,690 --> 01:50:25,470
为什么  就因为他知道你爸爸的名字吗
Why? 'Cause he knows your daddy's name?

1870
01:50:27,530 --> 01:50:28,550
连我都不知道
I didn't.

1871
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:31,720
灭霸带着灵魂宝石离开了这里
Thanos left here with the stone...

1872
01:50:32,950 --> 01:50:34,600
却没带走他女儿
without his daughter.

1873
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:36,440
那不是巧合
That's not a coincidence.

1874
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:38,860
的确
Yeah.

1875
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:42,780
不惜一切
Whatever it takes.

1876
01:50:47,670 --> 01:50:48,740
不惜一切
Whatever it takes.

1877
01:50:53,510 --> 01:50:55,000
如果我们拿不到宝石
If we don't get that stone...

1878
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:57,170
几十亿人就不能复生
billions of people stay dead.

1879
01:50:58,140 --> 01:50:58,880
是啊
Yeah.

1880
01:51:01,270 --> 01:51:03,130
我想我们都知道该牺牲的是谁了
Then I guess we both know who it's gotta be.

1881
01:51:04,070 --> 01:51:05,220
我想是的
I guess we do.

1882
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:14,980
我开始觉得
I'm starting to think

1883
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:17,980
我们想的不是一个人  娜塔莎
we mean different people here, Natasha.

1884
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:20,870
过去五年来  我一直在为一件事努力
For the last five years, I've been trying to do one thing.

1885
01:51:20,870 --> 01:51:21,980
就是此刻
Get to right here.

1886
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,170
一切都是为了此刻  让所有人复生
That's all it's been about. Bringing everybody back.

1887
01:51:24,170 --> 01:51:26,750
不  你别在这时候跟我装伟大
No, don't you get all decent on me now.

1888
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:28,320
怎么  你以为我想这么做吗
What, you think I wanna do it?

1889
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:31,170
我是在救你的命  傻瓜
I'm trying to save your life, you idiot.

1890
01:51:31,180 --> 01:51:33,330
可我不想让你救  行吗
Yeah, well, I don't want you to. How's that?

1891
01:51:34,550 --> 01:51:36,370
娜塔莎  你知道我都做了什么
Natasha, you know what I've done.

1892
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:39,920
你知道我已变成了什么样的人
You know what I've become.

1893
01:51:42,230 --> 01:51:44,880
我不会以一个人最糟糕的错误来评判他
I don't judge people on their worst mistakes.

1894
01:51:49,110 --> 01:51:50,220
或许你应该这样
Maybe you should.

1895
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:52,300
你当年就没有
You didn't.

1896
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:00,730
你真是太烦人了  你知道吗
You're a pain in my ass, you know that?

1897
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:12,990
好
Okay.

1898
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:16,200
你赢了
You win.

1899
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:24,500
跟我家人说我爱他们
Tell my family I love 'em.

1900
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:29,130
你自己告诉他们
You tell 'em yourself.

1901
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:03,420
该死的
Damn you.

1902
01:53:10,650 --> 01:53:11,470
等等
Wait.

1903
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:20,810
放手吧
Let me go.

1904
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:23,650
不
No.

1905
01:53:25,710 --> 01:53:26,730
不要啊
No. Please, no.

1906
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:31,070
没事的
It's okay.

1907
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:34,950
别
Please.

1908
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:37,660
不要
No!

1909
01:55:19,490 --> 01:55:20,600
我们都拿到了吗
Did we get 'em all?

1910
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:23,560
你是说真成功了吗
Are you telling me this actually worked?

1911
01:55:28,410 --> 01:55:29,610
克林特  小娜呢
Clint, where's Nat?

1912
01:55:58,990 --> 01:56:00,430
她有家人吗
Do we know if she had family?

1913
01:56:00,990 --> 01:56:01,800
有
Yeah.

1914
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:03,350
我们
Us.

1915
01:56:04,820 --> 01:56:05,520
什么
What?

1916
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:09,080
-你干什么  -就是问他个问题
- What are you doing? - Just asked him a question.

1917
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:10,450
不  你一副她已经死了的样子
Yeah, no, you're acting like she's dead.

1918
01:56:10,450 --> 01:56:11,540
我们为什么一副她已经死了的样子
Why are we acting like she's dead?

1919
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:12,980
我们有宝石啊
We have the stones, right?

1920
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:14,710
只要我们有宝石  队长
As long as we have the stones, Cap,

1921
01:56:14,710 --> 01:56:15,830
我们能复活她的  是吧
we can bring her back. Isn't that right?

1922
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:18,340
别垂头丧气的了  我们是复仇者  振作起来
So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers. Get it together.

1923
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:19,570
不能复活她
Can't get her back.

1924
01:56:22,510 --> 01:56:23,970
他说什么...什么
What's he...? What?

1925
01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:25,290
不能撤销
It can't be undone.

1926
01:56:25,930 --> 01:56:26,790
不能
It can't.

1927
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:31,390
对不起  别介意
Look, I'm sorry, no offense, but

1928
01:56:31,390 --> 01:56:33,180
但你就是个地球人  好吗
you're a very earthly being, okay?

1929
01:56:33,190 --> 01:56:34,770
这可是太空魔法
And we're talking about space magic.

1930
01:56:34,770 --> 01:56:36,780
"不能"也太绝对了  不是吗
And "can't" seems very definitive. Don't you think?

1931
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:39,820
我知道这远超我的水平
Yeah, look, I know that I'm way outside my pay grade here.

1932
01:56:39,820 --> 01:56:41,470
但她还是不在  是吧
But she still isn't here, is she?

1933
01:56:41,570 --> 01:56:42,690
我就是这意思
No, that's my point.

1934
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:45,350
是不能撤销的
It can't be undone.

1935
01:56:45,820 --> 01:56:46,740
至少
Or that's at least

1936
01:56:46,740 --> 01:56:49,200
那个飘着的红人是这么说的
what the red, floating guy had to say.

1937
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:50,870
或许你该去跟他谈谈
Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay?

1938
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:54,270
你去拿上锤子  飞过去  跟他谈谈
Go grab your hammer and you go fly and you talk to him.

1939
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:03,740
本该是我的
It was supposed to be me.

1940
01:57:06,890 --> 01:57:09,260
她为了那颗宝石牺牲了生命
She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone.

1941
01:57:09,260 --> 01:57:10,750
她赌上了性命
She bet her life on it.

1942
01:57:15,730 --> 01:57:17,340
她回不来了
She's not coming back.

1943
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:21,590
我们不能让她白死
We have to make it worth it.

1944
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:22,970
绝对不能
We have to.

1945
01:57:24,820 --> 01:57:25,680
不会的
We will.

1946
01:57:57,810 --> 01:57:59,300
好  手套准备好了
All right, the glove's ready.

1947
01:58:00,230 --> 01:58:02,840
问题是  谁来打指响
Question is, who's gonna snap their freakin' fingers?

1948
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:04,260
我来
I'll do it.

1949
01:58:04,690 --> 01:58:05,530
-什么  -没事
- Excuse me? - It's okay.

1950
01:58:05,530 --> 01:58:07,180
-不不  -打住  别急
- No, no, no. - Stop, stop. Slow down.

1951
01:58:07,570 --> 01:58:08,660
托尔  等等
Thor. Just wait.

1952
01:58:08,660 --> 01:58:10,720
我们还没决定由谁来戴
We haven't decided who's gonna put that on yet.

1953
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:12,870
不好意思  难道我们还要干坐着
I'm sorry. What, we're all just sitting around

1954
01:58:12,870 --> 01:58:14,330
等待合适时机吗
waiting for the right opportunity?

1955
01:58:14,330 --> 01:58:15,620
我们至少该谈谈
We should at least discuss it.

1956
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:17,460
坐在这里盯着它看
Look, sitting here staring at the thing

1957
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:19,320
是不会让大家复活的
is not gonna bring everybody back.

1958
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:21,880
我是最强的复仇者  好吗
I'm the strongest Avenger, okay?

1959
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:23,630
所以这责任该由我来担
So, this responsibility falls upon me.

1960
01:58:23,630 --> 01:58:24,840
-一般来说  你是对的  -这是我的责任
- Normally, you're right. - It's my duty.

1961
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:25,920
-但那不是重点  -不是那个
- It's not about that. - It's not that.

1962
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:28,660
-伙计  -住口  让我来吧
- Hey, buddy... - Stop it! Just let me.

1963
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:33,120
让我来吧
Just let me do it.

1964
01:58:33,510 --> 01:58:35,470
让我做件好事  做件对的事
Just let me do something good. Something right.

1965
01:58:35,470 --> 01:58:37,020
这不光是因为
Look, it's not just the fact that

1966
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:38,690
那只手套所承载的能量
that glove is channeling enough energy

1967
01:58:38,690 --> 01:58:39,600
足以点亮一个大陆
to light up a continent.

1968
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:41,730
相信我  你的状态不行
I'm telling you. You're in no condition.

1969
01:58:41,730 --> 01:58:45,070
你以为我现在血管里流的是什么
What do you think is coursing through my veins right now?

1970
01:58:45,070 --> 01:58:46,130
奶酪吗
Cheez Whiz?

1971
01:58:48,780 --> 01:58:49,530
雷电
Lightning.

1972
01:58:49,530 --> 01:58:50,860
-是啊  -雷电
- Yeah. - Lightning.

1973
01:58:50,870 --> 01:58:52,560
雷电也帮不了你  伙计
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1974
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:53,930
得由我来
It's gotta be me.

1975
01:58:55,700 --> 01:58:58,020
你们看到宝石对灭霸的伤害了
You saw what those stones did to Thanos.

1976
01:58:58,080 --> 01:58:59,360
他差点没命
They almost killed him.

1977
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:03,110
你们都撑不住的
None of you could survive.

1978
01:59:03,590 --> 01:59:04,990
我们怎么知道你撑得住
How do we know you will?

1979
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:06,530
我们不知道
We don't.

1980
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:09,120
但辐射主要就是伽马射线
But the radiation's mostly gamma.

1981
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:14,160
就好像
It's like...

1982
01:59:16,350 --> 01:59:17,960
我是为此而诞生的
I was made for this.

1983
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:38,560
可以了吗
Good to go, yeah?

1984
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:41,770
开始吧
Let's do it.

1985
01:59:42,210 --> 01:59:43,120
好  记住
Okay, remember,

1986
01:59:43,130 --> 01:59:44,920
五年前被灭霸的指响打没的人
everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago

1987
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:47,320
你把他们带回来  回到现在  今天来
you're just bringing them back to now, today.

1988
01:59:47,710 --> 01:59:49,740
别改变过去五年里的任何事
Don't change anything from the last five years.

1989
01:59:50,420 --> 01:59:51,450
好的
Got it.

1990
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:09,230
星期五  帮个忙
Friday, do me a favor

1991
02:00:09,240 --> 02:00:11,030
启动谷仓门协议  好吗
and activate Barn Door Protocol, will ya?

1992
02:00:11,030 --> 02:00:12,050
是  老板
Yes, boss.

1993
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:22,480
大家回家吧
Everybody comes home.

1994
02:00:46,150 --> 02:00:47,600
摘掉
Take it off! Take it off!

1995
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:49,260
不  等等  布鲁斯  你没事吧
No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?

1996
02:00:50,030 --> 02:00:51,180
说话  班纳
Talk to me, Banner.

1997
02:00:54,700 --> 02:00:55,720
我没事
I'm okay.

1998
02:00:56,070 --> 02:00:56,930
我没事
I'm okay.

1999
02:01:28,690 --> 02:01:29,460
布鲁斯
Bruce!

2000
02:01:31,480 --> 02:01:32,430
别碰他
Don't move him.

2001
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:42,600
-成功了吗  -我们不确定  没事的
- Did it work? - We're not sure. It's okay.

2002
02:02:28,620 --> 02:02:29,440
亲爱的
Honey.

2003
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:30,360
克林特
Clint?

2004
02:02:30,670 --> 02:02:31,490
亲爱的
Honey.

2005
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:33,780
各位
Guys...

2006
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:38,280
好像成功了
I think it worked.

2007
02:03:20,050 --> 02:03:22,540
我无法呼吸了
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

2008
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:25,660
脱罩
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

2014
02:03:59,470 --> 02:04:00,840

We're on the lower level. It's flooding!

2015
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:02,490
什么

2016
02:04:02,550 --> 02:04:05,010
我们要淹死了  有人收到吗  求救

我在  收到了吗
I'm here. Can you hear me?

2019
02:04:28,660 --> 02:04:29,690
队长

2020
02:04:56,100 --> 02:04:57,130

2021
02:05:14,370 --> 02:05:15,320
女儿

是  父亲

好样的
Well done.

2025
02:05:22,710 --> 02:05:24,030
谢谢  父亲
Thank you, Father.

2026
02:05:24,260 --> 02:05:25,870
他们毫未怀疑
They suspected nothing.

2027
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:29,700
自大者总是如此
The arrogant never do.

2028
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:33,330
去
Go.

2029
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:37,050
找到宝石  拿给我
Find the stones, bring them to me.

2030
02:05:37,190 --> 02:05:38,510
你要做什么
What will you do?

2031
02:05:40,230 --> 02:05:41,420
等着
Wait.

2032
02:06:07,220 --> 02:06:08,450
告诉我
Tell me something.

2033
02:06:09,890 --> 02:06:11,200
在未来
In the future...

2034
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:14,210
你和我怎么样了
what happens to you and me?

2035
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:18,040
我企图杀你
I try to kill you.

2036
02:06:20,060 --> 02:06:21,420
好几次
Several times.

2037
02:06:22,650 --> 02:06:23,800
但最终
But eventually...

2038
02:06:24,740 --> 02:06:25,970
我们成了朋友
we become friends.

2039
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:29,720
我们成了姐妹
We become sisters.

2040
02:06:37,540 --> 02:06:38,480
来吧
Come on.

2041
02:06:40,750 --> 02:06:41,990
我们可以阻止他
We can stop him.

2042
02:06:50,840 --> 02:06:51,910
拜托  伙计  醒醒
Come on, buddy, wake up!

2043
02:06:52,510 --> 02:06:53,580
这就对了
That's my man.

2044
02:06:54,970 --> 02:06:57,420
你再弄丢  我可就不还你了
You lose this again, I'm keeping it.

2045
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:01,590
怎么回事
What happened?

2046
02:07:01,900 --> 02:07:03,920
你扰乱时间  时间就给你捣乱
You mess with time, it tends to mess back.

2047
02:07:04,110 --> 02:07:05,090
你会明白的
You'll see.

2048
02:07:27,170 --> 02:07:28,240
他都干什么了
What's he been doing?

2049
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:31,700
什么都没干
Absolutely nothing.

2050
02:07:33,550 --> 02:07:35,080
宝石呢
Where are the stones?

2051
02:07:35,720 --> 02:07:37,370
在这堆东西下面
Somewhere under all this.

2052
02:07:39,020 --> 02:07:40,630
我只知道他没拿到
All I know is he doesn't have 'em.

2053
02:07:41,480 --> 02:07:42,980
那就别让他拿到
So, we keep it that way.

2054
02:07:42,980 --> 02:07:44,710
你们知道这是陷阱吧
You know it's a trap, right?

2055
02:07:44,900 --> 02:07:45,840
知道
Yeah.

2056
02:07:46,230 --> 02:07:47,510
我不怎么在乎
I don't much care.

2057
02:07:48,490 --> 02:07:49,260
很好
Good.

2058
02:07:50,490 --> 02:07:53,010
只要我们都达成一致就行
Just as long as we're all in agreement.

2059
02:08:02,870 --> 02:08:04,690
我们这次要好好杀了他
Let's kill him properly this time.

2060
02:08:14,090 --> 02:08:16,700
你们无法承受自己的失败
You could not live with your own failure.

2061
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:19,920
结果如何呢
Where did that bring you?

2062
02:08:23,310 --> 02:08:24,340
又跟我碰面了
Back to me.

2063
02:08:28,650 --> 02:08:31,300
我本以为抹除了一半的生命
I thought by eliminating half of life...

2064
02:08:32,030 --> 02:08:34,180
另一半就能兴旺
the other half would thrive.

2065
02:08:34,870 --> 02:08:36,310
但你们让我知道
But you've shown me...

2066
02:08:37,330 --> 02:08:38,850
那是不可能的
that's impossible.

2067
02:08:40,950 --> 02:08:44,190
只要还有人记得曾经
And as long as there are those that remember what was...

2068
02:08:44,290 --> 02:08:45,790
就总会有人
there will always be those

2069
02:08:45,790 --> 02:08:49,400
无法接受可能的未来
that are unable to accept what can be.

2070
02:08:50,420 --> 02:08:51,780
他们会抵抗
They will resist.

2071
02:08:52,050 --> 02:08:53,950
对  我们就那么固执
Yep, we're all kinds of stubborn.

2072
02:08:54,930 --> 02:08:56,200
我很感激
I'm thankful.

2073
02:08:58,600 --> 02:08:59,960
因为现在
Because now...

2074
02:09:00,680 --> 02:09:02,380
我知道我该怎么办了
I know what I must do.

2075
02:09:03,270 --> 02:09:08,300
我要粉碎全宇宙  化为原子
I will shred this universe down to its last atom.

2076
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:10,470
然后
And then...

2077
02:09:11,110 --> 02:09:13,600
再用你们替我收集的宝石
with the stones you've collected for me...

2078
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:15,640
创造个新宇宙
create a new one...

2079
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:18,140
充满生机
teeming with life...

2080
02:09:18,830 --> 02:09:20,660
它不会知道自己失去了什么
that knows not what it has lost...

2081
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:22,770
只知道它被赋予了什么
but only what it has been given.

2082
02:09:26,330 --> 02:09:28,110
一个感恩的宇宙
A grateful universe.

2083
02:09:28,340 --> 02:09:29,790
从鲜血中诞生
Born out of blood.

2084
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:31,200
他们不会知道的
They'll never know it.

2085
02:09:32,510 --> 02:09:34,990
因为你们活不到那时告诉他们
Because you won't be alive to tell them.

2086
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:51,930
另一边见了  伙计
See you on the other side, man.

2087
02:09:53,990 --> 02:09:55,850
撑着  我来了
Hang on! I'm coming!

2088
02:10:26,170 --> 02:10:27,060
好啊
Yeah!

2089
02:10:43,650 --> 02:10:44,620
我认识你
I know you.

2090
02:10:48,420 --> 02:10:49,300
父亲
Father...

2091
02:10:50,150 --> 02:10:51,380
我拿到宝石了
I have the stones.

2092
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:52,440
什么
What?

2093
02:10:53,980 --> 02:10:54,920
住手
Stop.

2094
02:11:00,170 --> 02:11:01,420
你要背叛我们
You're betraying us?

2095
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:08,930
你不用这么做的
You don't have to do this.

2096
02:11:11,590 --> 02:11:14,250
我就是这样
I am this.

2097
02:11:14,350 --> 02:11:16,200
不  你不是
No, you're not.

2098
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:18,110
你看到我们变成什么样了
You've seen what we become.

2099
02:11:24,640 --> 02:11:26,130
星云  听她的
Nebula, listen to her.

2100
02:11:28,460 --> 02:11:29,520
你可以改变的
You can change.

2101
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:37,080
他不会允许的
He won't let me.

2102
02:11:39,130 --> 02:11:40,070
不要
No!

2103
02:11:59,350 --> 02:12:01,090
好  托尔  来吧
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

2104
02:12:17,450 --> 02:12:18,570
老板  醒醒
Boss, wake up!

2105
02:13:10,060 --> 02:13:11,050
我就知道
I knew it!

2106
02:14:33,950 --> 02:14:35,950
我南征北战这么多年
In all my years of conquest...

2107
02:14:37,790 --> 02:14:38,820
暴力
violence...

2108
02:14:40,660 --> 02:14:41,690
屠戮
slaughter...

2109
02:14:43,700 --> 02:14:45,040
从来不是出于私怨
it was never personal.

2110
02:14:48,860 --> 02:14:50,120
但告诉你们
But I'll tell you now...

2111
02:14:52,940 --> 02:14:55,530
我马上要对你们顽固讨厌的
what I'm about to do to your stubborn,

2112
02:14:56,440 --> 02:14:58,180
小星球做的事
annoying little planet...

2113
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:02,010
我会非常
I'm gonna enjoy it...

2114
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:05,250
享受其中的
very, very much.

2115
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:11,080
队长  收到吗
Hey, Cap, you read me?

2116
02:16:17,330 --> 02:16:18,980
队长  我是山姆  收到吗
Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me?

2117
02:16:23,670 --> 02:16:24,710
在你左边
On your left.

2118
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:51,800
就这些人了吗
Is that everyone?

2119
02:17:52,260 --> 02:17:53,540
什么  你还嫌不够吗
What? You wanted more?

2120
02:18:20,930 --> 02:18:22,160
复仇者
Avengers...

2121
02:18:27,860 --> 02:18:28,810
集结
assemble.

2122
02:19:04,140 --> 02:19:05,220
死吧
Die!

2123
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:27,320
不  那个给我
No, no, give me that.

2124
02:19:27,440 --> 02:19:28,540
你拿那个小的
You have the little one.

2125
02:19:44,610 --> 02:19:45,590
我去
Holy cow!

2126
02:19:45,590 --> 02:19:46,840
你不会相信都发生了什么的
You will not believe what's been going on.

2127
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:48,480
还记得我们在太空里时吗
Do you remember when we were in space?

2128
02:19:48,620 --> 02:19:49,870
我化成灰了
And I got all dusty?

2129
02:19:49,870 --> 02:19:50,880
我肯定是昏了过去
And I must've passed out,

2130
02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:52,460
因为我醒来时  你不在了
because I woke up and you were gone.

2131
02:19:52,460 --> 02:19:54,450
但斯特兰奇博士在  他说
But Doctor Strange was there, right? And he was like...

2132
02:19:54,450 --> 02:19:56,040
"已经过去五年了  快走  他们需要我们"
"It's been five years. Come on, they need us."

2133
02:19:56,040 --> 02:19:57,740
然后他就开始画那个亮亮的黄圈
And then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing

2134
02:19:57,740 --> 02:19:59,000
-就他老做的那个  -是吗
- that he does all the time. - He did? Oh, no.

2135
02:19:59,000 --> 02:19:59,940
你干什么
What are you doing?

2136
02:20:05,440 --> 02:20:06,450
感觉好棒
Oh, this is nice.

2137
02:20:28,940 --> 02:20:29,840
卡魔拉
Gamora?

2138
02:20:39,230 --> 02:20:40,330
我以为我失去了你
I thought I lost you.

2139
02:20:45,420 --> 02:20:47,880
别  碰  我
Don't touch me!

2140
02:20:51,350 --> 02:20:52,650
你第一次没打中
You missed the first time.

2141
02:20:53,400 --> 02:20:55,470
然后第二次你一下踢中了俩
Then you got 'em both the second time.

2142
02:20:57,480 --> 02:20:58,460
就是他吗
This is the one?

2143
02:20:58,540 --> 02:20:59,580
不是吧
Seriously?

2144
02:20:59,850 --> 02:21:02,070
你只能在他和一棵树之间选择
Your choices were him or a tree.

2145
02:21:12,740 --> 02:21:13,610
队长
Cap!

2146
02:21:13,780 --> 02:21:15,410
你要我怎么处理这玩意啊
What do you want me to do with this damn thing?

2147
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:20,230
把那些宝石拿得越远越好
Get those stones as far away as possible!

2148
02:21:20,400 --> 02:21:21,310
不
No!

2149
02:21:22,620 --> 02:21:24,800
我们还得把它们送回原处
We need to get 'em back where they came from.

2150
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:25,590
没法送回去了
No way to get 'em back.

2151
02:21:25,590 --> 02:21:27,230
灭霸毁了量子隧道
Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.

2152
02:21:27,450 --> 02:21:28,370
等等
Hold on!

2153
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:31,900
那不是唯一的时间机器
That wasn't our only time machine.

2154
02:21:38,350 --> 02:21:40,420
有人看到一辆丑爆了的棕色货车了吗
Anyone see an ugly brown van out there?

2155
02:21:40,790 --> 02:21:41,690
看到了
Yes!

2156
02:21:41,800 --> 02:21:43,690
但你不会喜欢它停车的地方的
But you're not gonna like where it's parked!

2157
02:21:43,820 --> 02:21:46,290
斯科特  你启动它需要多久
Scott, how long you need to get that thing working?

2158
02:21:47,540 --> 02:21:48,560
大概10分钟
Maybe 10 minutes.

2159
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:50,360
去启动机器  我们把宝石送去给你
Get it started. We'll get the stones to you.

2160
02:21:50,400 --> 02:21:51,410
好的  队长
We're on it, Cap.

2161
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:05,170
你说是一千四百万之一的概率能赢  是吧
You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah?

2162
02:22:07,090 --> 02:22:08,150
就是这次吧
Tell me this is it.

2163
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:09,860
如果我告诉你会发生什么
If I tell you what happens...

2164
02:22:10,550 --> 02:22:11,590
就不会发生了
it won't happen.

2165
02:22:15,430 --> 02:22:16,400
你最好是对的
You better be right.

2166
02:22:24,750 --> 02:22:26,070
后面好乱
It's a mess back here.

2167
02:22:27,490 --> 02:22:28,490
没反应
It's dead.

2168
02:22:29,130 --> 02:22:30,390
-什么  -没反应
- What? - It's dead.

2169
02:22:30,970 --> 02:22:32,170
我得热启动试试
I have to hot-wire it.

2170
02:22:35,370 --> 02:22:36,450
星云呢
Where's Nebula?

2171
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:39,000
她没回应
She's not responding.

2172
02:22:39,460 --> 02:22:40,430
大人
Sire...

2173
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:51,370

给我
Give it to me.

2175
02:23:17,240 --> 02:23:20,530
你夺走了我的一切
You took everything from me.

2176
02:23:20,940 --> 02:23:22,840
我都不知道你是谁
I don't even know who you are.

2177
02:23:23,570 --> 02:23:24,540
你会知道的
You will.

2178
02:23:47,370 --> 02:23:48,340
交给我
I got it!

但大人  我们的部队
But, sire, our troops!

2182
02:24:19,700 --> 02:24:21,120
照办
Just do it!

2183
02:24:42,350 --> 02:24:43,710
有人看到了吗
Is anyone else seeing this?

2184
02:24:57,930 --> 02:24:58,890
我行的
I got this!

2185
02:24:59,180 --> 02:25:00,110
我行的

2186
02:25:00,110 --> 02:25:01,310
好吧  我不行了
Okay, I don't got this.

2187
02:25:01,450 --> 02:25:02,670
救命  谁救救我
Help, somebody help!

2188
02:25:02,670 --> 02:25:04,680
皇后区  看上面
Hey, Queens, heads up!

2189
02:25:14,610 --> 02:25:16,160
抓住  有我呢  孩子
Hang on. I got you, kid.

2190
02:25:19,820 --> 02:25:20,580
认识你很高兴
Nice to meet you...

2191
02:25:20,580 --> 02:25:21,900
老天爷啊
Oh, my God!

2192
02:25:58,980 --> 02:26:00,130
怎么回事
What the hell is this?

2193
02:26:01,070 --> 02:26:02,140
星期五  他们在冲什么开火
Friday, what are they firing at?

2194
02:26:02,140 --> 02:26:04,190
有什么刚进入了上层大气
Something just entered the upper atmosphere.

2195
02:26:18,280 --> 02:26:19,390
好样的
Oh, yeah!

2196
02:26:39,610 --> 02:26:41,990
丹弗斯  我们这里需要帮助
Danvers, we need an assist here.

2197
02:26:51,020 --> 02:26:53,210
我是彼得·帕克

02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:55,080
彼得·帕克
Hey, Peter Parker.

你有什么要给我吗
You got something for me?

2200
02:27:02,870 --> 02:27:04,670
我不知道你要怎么通过那一关
I don't know how you're gonna get it through all of that.

2201
02:27:06,490 --> 02:27:07,500
别担心
Don't worry.

2202
02:27:08,790 --> 02:27:09,980
她不是一个人
She's got help.

2203
02:29:58,230 --> 02:30:00,940
我是宿命
I am inevitable.

2204
02:30:21,950 --> 02:30:23,180
我
And I...

2205
02:30:25,110 --> 02:30:26,060
是

2206
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:31,040
钢铁侠
Iron Man.

2207
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:31,110
斯塔克先生
Mr. Stark?

2208
02:32:34,570 --> 02:32:36,600
斯塔克先生  你能听到我吗
Mr. Stark. Can you hear me?

2209
02:32:37,750 --> 02:32:38,710
我是彼得
It's Peter.

2210
02:32:43,180 --> 02:32:45,510
我们赢了  斯塔克先生
We won, Mr. Stark.

2211
02:32:48,010 --> 02:32:49,320
我们赢了  斯塔克先生
We won, Mr. Stark.

2212
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:53,780
我们赢了  你做到了  先生  你做到了

2213
02:32:55,760 --> 02:32:56,760
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

2214
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:57,960
托尼
Tony.

2215
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:13,930
小派
Hey, Pep.

2216
02:33:19,020 --> 02:33:19,960
星期五
Friday?

2217
02:33:20,340 --> 02:33:21,960
生命机能情况危急
Life functions critical.

2218
02:33:31,660 --> 02:33:32,550
托尼
Tony?

2219
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:34,980
看着我
Look at me.

2220
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:38,880
我们会没事的
We're gonna be okay.

2221
02:33:44,290 --> 02:33:45,430
你可以休息了
You can rest now.

2222
02:35:31,610 --> 02:35:33,950
大家都想要一个快乐的结局  对吗
Everybody wants a happy ending, right?

2223
02:35:34,650 --> 02:35:36,410
但世事难料
But it doesn't always roll that way.

2224
02:35:38,960 --> 02:35:40,050
也许这次的结局会是快乐的
Maybe this time.

2225
02:35:42,110 --> 02:35:44,300
我希望你们回放这个的时候
I'm hoping if you play this back...

2226
02:35:46,470 --> 02:35:47,770
是在庆祝
it's in celebration.

2227
02:35:49,050 --> 02:35:52,960
我希望家人能够团圆  我希望我们能挽回
I hope families are reunited. I hope we get it back.

2228
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:54,310
这个星球能够回归
And something like a normal version

2229
02:35:54,310 --> 02:35:55,890
还算正常的版本
of the planet has been restored.

2230
02:35:56,830 --> 02:35:58,910
如果真有这种东西的话
If there ever was such a thing.

2231
02:35:59,550 --> 02:36:02,540
天呐  世界真奇妙  宇宙真奇妙
God, what a world. Universe, now.

2232
02:36:03,470 --> 02:36:05,550
如果你十年前跟我说我们并不孤单
If you told me 10 years ago that we weren't alone...

2233
02:36:05,560 --> 02:36:07,840
而且还热闹到这种程度
let alone to this extent, I mean,

2234
02:36:07,840 --> 02:36:09,280
我倒不会觉得惊讶
I wouldn't have been surprised...

2235
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:10,790
但谁能想到呢
but come on, who knew?

2236
02:36:11,270 --> 02:36:14,200
轮番登场的史诗般的
The epic forces of darkness and light

2237
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:15,460
黑暗和光明势力
that have come into play.

2238
02:36:16,090 --> 02:36:17,560
不管是好是坏
And for better or worse...

2239
02:36:17,970 --> 02:36:19,570
这就是将伴随摩根
that's the reality Morgan's gonna

2240
02:36:19,570 --> 02:36:21,220
成长的现实
have to find a way to grow up in.

2241
02:36:25,530 --> 02:36:27,890
所以  我觉得最好录下一段问候
So, I thought I'd probably better record a little greeting,

2242
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:31,030
以防我英年早逝了
in the case of an untimely death. On my part.

2243
02:36:31,550 --> 02:36:34,210
虽然死亡总是来得太早
Not that death at any time isn't untimely.

2244
02:36:35,550 --> 02:36:37,910
我们明天要尝试的时间旅行
This time travel thing that we're gonna try and pull off tomorrow

2245
02:36:37,910 --> 02:36:41,400
真的很难说我们能不能活下来
it's got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all.

2246
02:36:41,400 --> 02:36:42,450
就是这样
That's the thing.

2247
02:36:44,690 --> 02:36:46,640
但是  做英雄就是如此  不是吗
Then again, that's the hero gig, right?

2248
02:36:46,640 --> 02:36:48,030
结束也是旅程的一部分
Part of the journey is the end.

2249
02:36:49,710 --> 02:36:50,780
我在耍什么疯
What am I even tripping for?

2250
02:36:50,790 --> 02:36:51,870
一切都会
Everything is gonna work out

2251
02:36:51,870 --> 02:36:54,910
如愿以偿的
exactly the way it's supposed to.

2252
02:36:58,610 --> 02:36:59,950
我爱你三千
I love you 3,000.

2253
02:39:15,090 --> 02:39:16,510
我希望有什么办法
You know, I wish there was a way

2254
02:39:17,570 --> 02:39:18,800
能让她知道
that I could let her know.

2255
02:39:21,470 --> 02:39:22,450
我们胜利了
That we won.

2256
02:39:24,880 --> 02:39:25,830
我们做到了
We did it.

2257
02:39:30,300 --> 02:39:31,260
她知道的
She knows.

2258
02:39:37,030 --> 02:39:38,170
他们俩都知道
They both do.

2259
02:39:47,970 --> 02:39:49,100
你好吗  小姑娘
How you doing, squirt?

2260
02:39:49,540 --> 02:39:50,280
我很好
Good.

2261
02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:51,240
好吗
You good?

2262
02:39:51,680 --> 02:39:53,110
好  你饿了吗
Good. You hungry?

2263
02:39:54,990 --> 02:39:55,890
你想吃什么
What do you want?

2264
02:39:56,690 --> 02:39:57,770
奶酪汉堡
Cheeseburgers.

2265
02:40:02,880 --> 02:40:04,450
你爸爸也喜欢奶酪汉堡
You know, your dad liked cheeseburgers.

2266
02:40:05,390 --> 02:40:06,400
好啊
Okay.

2267
02:40:09,410 --> 02:40:11,030
你想吃多少奶酪汉堡我都给你买
I'm gonna get you all the cheeseburgers you want.

2268
02:40:11,750 --> 02:40:12,630
好
Okay.

2269
02:40:29,550 --> 02:40:30,500
那么...
So...

2270
02:40:31,260 --> 02:40:32,670
你什么时候回来
when can we expect you back?

2271
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:36,740
这事嘛...
About that...

2272
02:40:37,140 --> 02:40:39,510
托尔  你的人民需要一个王
Thor, your people need a king.

2273
02:40:39,510 --> 02:40:41,130
不  他们已经有王了
No, they already have one.

2274
02:40:43,750 --> 02:40:44,730
真好笑
That's funny.

2275
02:40:50,100 --> 02:40:51,250
你是认真的吗
Are you being serious?

2276
02:40:55,500 --> 02:40:57,510
我该成为真正的自己
It's time for me to be who I am rather than

2277
02:40:58,500 --> 02:40:59,930
而不是去实现他人的期待
who I'm supposed to be.

2278
02:41:02,150 --> 02:41:03,870
但你  你是一个领袖
But you, you're a leader.

2279
02:41:04,620 --> 02:41:05,610
那就是真实的你
That's who you are.

2280
02:41:08,720 --> 02:41:10,710
我会在这里做出很多改变的
You know, I'd make a lot of changes around here.

2281
02:41:10,850 --> 02:41:12,160
我就指望你了
I'm counting on it...

2282
02:41:12,680 --> 02:41:13,790
女王陛下
Your Majesty.

2283
02:41:24,160 --> 02:41:25,390
那你要做什么
What will you do?

2284
02:41:26,100 --> 02:41:27,100
我不确定
I'm not sure.

2285
02:41:27,710 --> 02:41:29,730
千年以来  我第一次
For the first time in a thousand years,

2286
02:41:30,470 --> 02:41:31,540
失去了目标
I have no path.

2287
02:41:31,540 --> 02:41:32,820
但我有便车可以搭
I do have a ride though.

2288
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:34,990
动作快点  大毛球
Move it or lose it, hairbag.

2289
02:41:39,430 --> 02:41:40,580
你们在这里啊
Oh, here we are!

2290
02:41:41,530 --> 02:41:43,130
树  见到你真高兴
Tree, good to see you.

2291
02:41:47,770 --> 02:41:50,380
阿斯加德银河护卫队又重聚了
The Asgardians of the Galaxy back together again.

2292
02:41:51,380 --> 02:41:52,560
我们先去哪儿
Where to first?

2293
02:41:56,190 --> 02:41:58,400
提醒你一下  这还是我的飞船
Just so you know, this is my ship still.

2294
02:41:58,400 --> 02:41:59,380
我说了算
I'm in charge.

2295
02:41:59,610 --> 02:42:02,020
我知道  当然是你说了算
I know. I know. Of course you are.

2296
02:42:02,520 --> 02:42:03,490
当然了
Of course.

2297
02:42:06,670 --> 02:42:08,920
你说"当然了"  但你又碰地图了
See, you say, "of course," but then you touch the map.

2298
02:42:09,320 --> 02:42:10,040
这会让人觉得
It makes you think that

2299
02:42:10,040 --> 02:42:12,110
也许你并不明白是我说了算
maybe you didn't realize I was in charge.

2300
02:42:12,310 --> 02:42:15,120
-葵尔  这只是你的不安全感  -葵尔
- Quail, that's your own insecurities in there. - Quail?

2301
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:17,610
我只是想帮忙和协助
Okay? I am merely trying to be of service and assisting.

2302
02:42:17,610 --> 02:42:18,560
是奎尔
Quill.

2303
02:42:19,040 --> 02:42:20,050
我就是这么说的
That's what I said.

2304
02:42:20,060 --> 02:42:22,490
你们应该为领袖地位的荣耀一战较高下
You should fight one another for the honor of leadership.

2305
02:42:22,540 --> 02:42:23,620
这样公平
Sounds fair.

2306
02:42:26,590 --> 02:42:28,950
-没必要吧  -没必要
- It's not necessary, okay? - It's not.

2307
02:42:28,950 --> 02:42:29,990
我有爆能枪
I got some blasters,

2308
02:42:29,990 --> 02:42:31,650
除非你们想用刀
unless you guys wanna use knives.

2309
02:42:31,980 --> 02:42:34,100
好啊  请用刀吧
Oh, yes! Please, use knives.

2310
02:42:34,100 --> 02:42:35,160
用刀吧
Yeah. Knives.

2311
02:42:35,170 --> 02:42:36,350
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

2312
02:42:42,720 --> 02:42:44,130
没必要的
Not necessary.

2313
02:42:44,130 --> 02:42:45,770
我们不该以刀相见
There shall be no knifing one another.

2314
02:42:45,780 --> 02:42:48,240
大家都知道谁说了算
Everybody knows who's in charge.

2315
02:42:52,390 --> 02:42:53,360
我
Me.

2316
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:55,960
对吧
Right?

2317
02:42:56,540 --> 02:42:58,340
没错  是你
Yes, you.

2318
02:42:58,980 --> 02:42:59,970
当然
Of course!

2319
02:43:00,360 --> 02:43:01,310
当然
Of course.

2320
02:43:01,670 --> 02:43:02,650
当然
Of course.

2321
02:43:04,910 --> 02:43:05,890
记住
Remember...

2322
02:43:07,300 --> 02:43:09,780
你得把宝石还回它们被拿走的那一刻
you have to return the stones to the exact moment you got 'em

2323
02:43:09,780 --> 02:43:12,580
否则就会开启一堆讨厌的平行现实
or you're gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities.

2324
02:43:13,210 --> 02:43:14,310
别担心  布鲁斯
