This year has been nothing short of--

84
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,690
疯狂  简直太疯狂了
...is crazy. It's, like, insane.

85

88
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,250

Historic.

89
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,520
五年多前
Over five years ago,

90
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,350
全宇宙一半的生命
half of all life in the universe,

91
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,490
也包括我们城中高中的一半生命
including our own Midtown High...

92
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,360
都被抹去了
...was wiped from existence.

93
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,920
但八个月前
But then eight months ago,

94
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,560
一群勇敢的英雄把我们带了回来
a band of brave heroes brought us back.

95
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,560
此事件被称为"闪烁"
They called it "The Blip."

96
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,420
我们这些闪灭了的人  以原年龄回归了
Those of us who Blipped away came back the same age...

97
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,390
但我们没有闪灭的同学们
But our classmates that didn't Blip

98
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,890
则长大了五岁
had grown five years older.

99
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,460
是啊  我弟弟现在比我大了
Yeah, like my little brother is now older than me.

100
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,820
是啊  这是数学
Yeah, it's math.

101
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,250
尽管我们闪灭时  学年已过去了一半
And even though we had Blipped away halfway through the school year

102
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,520
而且已经考过期中考了
and had already taken midterms,

103
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,390
学校还是要求我们从头重上这个学年
the school made us start the year over from the beginning.

104
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,990
太不公平了  这不对
It's totally unfair. It's not right.

105
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,290
城中虎们
Tigers...

106
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,450
这段旅程漫长  戏剧性
...it's been a long, dramatic,

107
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,590
而且还有些令人困惑
somewhat confusing road.

108
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,790
随着今年即将结束
As we draw this year to a close,

109
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,090
我们也该向前看了
it's time to move on...

110
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,050
迎来我们生命的新阶段
to a new phase of our lives.

111
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,210
祈祷不会再发生什么疯狂事
Pray nothing crazy happens again

112
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,320
因为现在还有复仇者联盟吗
because are the Avengers even like a thing anymore?

113
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,960
有人有什么计划吗
Does anyone even have a plan?

114
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,490
我有个计划
I have a plan.

115
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,250
首先  我要在飞机上挨着MJ坐
Okay. First, I'm gonna sit next to MJ on the flight.

116
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,520
第二  我要买个双耳机插口
Second, I'm gonna buy a dual headphone adapter

117
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,490
跟她看一路的电影
and watch movies with her the whole time.

118
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,620
-好  -第三
- Okay. - Three,

119
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,550
等我们到了威尼斯
when we go to Venice,

120
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,720
那里的玻璃制品非常有名  是吧
Venice is super famous for making stuff out of glass right?

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,050
-对  -所以我要给她买条黑色大丽花项链
- True. - So, I'm gonna buy her a black dahlia necklace

122
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,020
因为她最喜欢的花就是黑色大丽花
because her favorite flower is the black dahlia

123
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,590
-因为...  -那起谋杀
- because of, well... - The murder.

124
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,720
没错  第四  等我们到了巴黎
The murder. Four, when we go to Paris,

125
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,920
我要带她登上埃菲尔铁塔顶部
I'm gonna take her to the top of the Eiffel Tower,

126
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,190
把项链送她
give her the necklace.

127
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,520
然后  第五  我要向她表白
And then, five, I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

128
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,750
然后  第六  希望她会说
And then, six, hopefully she tells me

129
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,090
她对我也有一样的感觉
she feels the same way.

130
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,520
别忘了第七步
Oh, don't forget step seven.

131
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,620
-第七步  -以上都别做
- Step Seven. - Don't do any of that.

132
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,790
为什么
Why?

133
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,920
因为我们将在欧洲做单身汉  彼得
Because, we're gonna be bachelors in Europe, Peter.

134
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,850
-内德  -听着
- Ned. - Look,

135
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,950
别的我不知道  但我知道这个
I may not know much, but I do know this:

136
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,950
欧洲人爱美国人
Europeans love Americans.

137
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,720
-是吗  -而且半数欧洲人是女人
- Really? - More than half are women.

138
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,290
好吧  行
Okay. Sure.

139
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,290
但...我真的很喜欢MJ  好吗
But... I really like MJ, man, okay?

140
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,320
她很棒  有种很黑暗的幽默感
She's awesome, she's super funny in a kind of dark way.

141
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,820
有时我还会逮到她看我
And sometimes I catch her looking at me,

142
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,120
我觉得我已错过...
and I feel like I've stood up...

143
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,150
-她来了  别说话...  -好啊  呆子们
- She's coming. Just don't say any... - What up, dorks?

144
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,320
期待科学游吗
Excited about the science trip?

145
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,920
当然  我们正聊科学游的事呢
Hey, yeah. We're just talking about the trip.

146
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,160
是啊  还有彼得的计划
Yeah, and Peter's plan.

147
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,320
你还有计划
You have a plan?

148
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,660
我没有什么计划
I don't... I don't have a plan.

149
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,020
他打算在我们周游各国期间
He's... He's just gonna collect tiny spoons

150
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,590
收集各种小勺子
when we're traveling to other countries.

151
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,950
像个老太太那样吗
Like a... Like a grandmother?

152
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,790
我没打算收集小勺子
I'm not collecting tiny spoons.

153
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,320
他才收集小勺子呢
He's collecting tiny spoons.

154
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,720
好吧
Okay, well...

155
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,990
真是跌宕起伏
that was a real roller coaster.

156
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,720
对了  旅游建议
By the way, travel tip:

157
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,950
你应该在手机上下载个VPN

00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,520
未知号码  是他

对  是哈皮
Yeah, it's Happy.

460
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,990
他在这儿  来做志工
He's here. He came by to volunteer.

461
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,090
顺便来办公室看看
And he's hanging around the office.

462
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,790
-他想跟你打个招呼  -我不想...彼得
- And he wants to say hi. - I don't want... Hi, Peter.

463
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,420
哈皮
Hey, Happy.

464
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,990
抱歉  我忙呢  我得送个传单
Sorry, I'm working hard here. I gotta do a... A leaflet drop.

465
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,150
-你在干什么...  -很高兴你玩得开心
- What are you doing in...? - Glad you're having a good time.

466
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,090
别担心  我会照顾好你婶婶
Don't worry, I'm really taking care of your aunt.

467
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,790
你的计划怎么样了
So how's the plan going?

468
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,650
是遭遇了些挫折
There's been setbacks, for sure.

469
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,320
别想太多  相信直觉就好
Don't over think it, just trust your instincts, you'll be fine.

470
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,350
我知道  爱你  再见
I know. Love you. Bye.

471
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,950
那人是谁
Who is that guy?

472
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,260
他就像钢铁侠和托尔的集合体
He's Iron Man and Thor rolled into one.

473
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,720
他还行吧  他可不比蜘蛛侠
He's all right. He's no Spider-Man.

474
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,960
你为什么这么痴迷于蜘蛛侠
What is it with you and Spider-Man?

475
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,750
怎么了  他很赞的
What? He's just awesome, okay?

476
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,050
他保护本地社区  很激励人
He protects the neighborhood and, you know, he's inspiring.

477
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,890
他激励我做个更好的人
He inspires me to be a better man.

478
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,590
好啊  蠢蛋
What's up, dickwad?

479
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,890
我以为你淹死了
Thought you drowned.

480
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,060
看来他名叫神秘客
Sounds like his name's Mysterio.

481
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,550
那句话
"L'uomo del misterio"

482
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,490
是意大利语  "神秘男子"
is Italian for "Man of mystery."

483
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,190
他们并不清楚他的身份
They don't actually know who he is.

484
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,220
神秘客
Mysterio.

485
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,090
名字不错
Cool name.

486
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:14,960
宝贝
Babe.

487
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,060
你看到了多少
So how much of that did you actually see?

488
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,960
没看到多少  我忙着跑呢
Not much. I was running.

489
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,620
是啊  我也是  我也忙着跑呢
Right. Me too. I was also running...

490
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,290
跑远
away.

491
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,390
明天去巴黎了
So Paris tomorrow.

492
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,720
去埃菲尔铁塔
Go to the Eiffel Tower.

493
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:29,990
应该很棒
Should be great.

494
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,890
我读到它建造的秘密目的是作为头脑控制天线
Yeah, I read it was secretly built as a mind control antenna

495
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,650
以制造疯子大军
to create an army of the insane.

496
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,390
所以那里是我整趟旅行最喜欢的目的地
Which is why it's my favorite destination on the whole trip.

497
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,590
你要怎么对付那个水怪
What are you gonna do about the water monster?

498
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,790
不做什么  它死了
Nothing. It's dead.

499
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,990
再说  那个神秘客都搞定了
Besides, that Mysterio guy's all over it.

500
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,950
我只想跟MJ一起玩玩
Look, I just wanna spend time with MJ.

501
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,350
我们刚刚聊起巴黎  我觉得她是喜欢我的
We were talking about Paris, and I think she really likes me.

502
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,520
真不错
That's nice.

503
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,450
让我想起了我和贝蒂刚相爱时
Reminds me of when Betty and I first fell in love.

504
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,720
我刚吃完我的水果馅饼
I had just finished my fruit cobbler, and...

505
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:07,290
联系你可真不容易  蜘蛛侠
You're a very difficult person to contact, Spider-Man.

506
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,150
你是尼克·弗瑞
You're Nick Fury.

507
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,520
你射晕了内德
And you just shot Ned.

508
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,020
只是温和的麻醉剂
Just a mild tranquilizer.

509
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,020
他不会有事的
He'll be all right.

510
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,950
很高兴终于见到你了
So good to finally meet you.

511
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,590
我在葬礼上看到你了
I saw you at the funeral,

512
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,620
但我觉得当时不是交换号码的好时机
but I didn't think that was a good time to exchange numbers.

513
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,450
是啊  那就太不合适了
No, that would've been really inappropriate.

514
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,620
-我不就这么说的吗  -是啊
- That's what I just said. - Right.

515
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,220
重要的是  你到这儿了
The important thing is, you're here.

516
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,820
我本想叫你来的
I tried to bring you here.

517
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,620
但你躲我  可现在你还是来了
You avoided me, and now you're here.

518
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,290
真巧
What a coincidence.

519
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,720
等等  这是巧合吗
Wait. Was this a coincidence?

520
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,650
我以前无所不知
I used to know everything.

521
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,620
然后我消失了五年再回来
Then I come back five years later,

522
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,620
现在我什么都不知道了
and now I know nothing.

523
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,220
没有情报  没有团队
No intel, no team.

524
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,690
一个高中小子
And a high school kid

525
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,850
都敢不接我电话
is dodging my calls.

526
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,490
我知道的是
Here's what I do know:

527
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:04,150
一周前  墨西哥一村庄被一场龙卷风摧毁
A week ago, a village in Mexico was wiped out by a cyclone.

528
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,850
目击者说  那龙卷风长了脸
Witnesses say that cyclone had a face.

529
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:15,850
三天后  摩洛哥发生类似事件
Three days later, a similar event in Morocco.

530
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,450
一个村庄...
A village was...

531
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,320
来查个房
Just making the rounds.

532
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,090
看看经历了今天的创伤性事件
See if anyone needs any emotional counseling

533
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,950
是否有人需要情感咨询
after today's traumatic events.

534
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,490
不  我们没事的  谢谢
No, we'll be okay. We're fine. Thank you.

535
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:30,120
很好  因为我其实没资格做...
Great because I'm... I'm not qualified to actually...

536
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,920
他睡熟了
Oh, he's passed out.

537
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,760
我反正也没那个资质  晚安了
I'm really not qualified to do it anyway, so good night.

538
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,720
那是我老师  抱歉了
That was my teacher. Sorry about that.

539
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,720
你刚刚在说
You were saying?

540
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,150
一个村庄被摧毁
A village was destroyed by

541
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,020
这可能又是一个威胁世界的...
what may well be another world-threatening...

542
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,390
宝贝  你还醒着吗
Babe, you still awake?

543
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,390
你不回我短信
You're not answering any of my texts.

544
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,120
他睡着了  贝蒂
He's asleep, Betty.

545
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,790
这么早
Oh, already?

546
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,520
-是啊  -好吧
- Yeah. - Okay.

547
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,490
所以  我们务必...
That's why it's imperative...

548
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,750
孩子们  今天那运河的水
Boys. So that canal water today

549
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,750
充满了危险的细菌
was filled with dangerous bacteria...

550
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,290
再有人来敲门
Another person touches that door,

551
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,650
你和我就又要参加一场葬礼了
you and I are going to attend another funeral.

552
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,240
穿战衣
Suit up.

553
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,990
如果你们俩有谁开始呕吐要告诉我
Let me know if either of you develop vomiting.

554
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,520
斯塔克把这个留给了你
Stark left these for you.

555
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,590
是吗
Really?

556
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,560
"欲戴王冠  必承其重"
"Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown."

557
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,120
斯塔克说你不会懂的
Stark said you wouldn't get that

558
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,650
因为不是《星战》梗
because it's not a Star Wars reference.

559
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,150
摘了面罩吧
You can lose the mask.

560
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,890
这里的人都见过你的真身
Everyone here has seen you without it.

561
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,450
你只是无故
You'd only be feigning anonymity

562
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,990
装神秘  还要隔着布料呼吸
and breathing through spandex for no good reason.

563
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,290
走吧
Come on.

564
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,290
好
Yeah.

565
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:57,450
那是玛丽亚·希尔
Over there, we have Maria Hill.

566
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,920
这是德米崔
That is Dimitri.

567
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,420
这是贝克先生
And this is Mr. Beck.

568
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,720
神秘客
Mysterio?

569
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:09,850
什么
What?

570
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,850
没什么
Doesn't matter.

571
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,820
我朋友这么喊你
It's what my friends have been calling you.

572
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,490
你可以喊我昆廷
Well, you can call me Quentin.

573
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,850
你今天的表现真出色
You handled yourself well out there today.

574
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,390
我看到你拉着那座钟塔了
I saw what you did with the tower.

575
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,450
我的世界就需要你这种人
We could use someone like you on my world.

576
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,450
谢谢
Thanks.

577
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,520
什么  你的世界
I'm sorry. Your world?

578
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,290
贝克先生是来自地球
Mr. Beck is from Earth.

579
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,050
但不是你的地球
Just not yours.

580
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,850
现实有很多个  彼得
There are multiple realities, Peter.

581
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,260
这里是616号地球  我来自833号地球
This is Earth Dimension 616. I'm from Earth 833.

582
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,090
抱歉  你是说存在多元宇宙吗
I'm sorry, you're saying there's a multiverse?

583
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,520
我以为那只是个理论
'Cause I thought that was just theoretical.

584
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,590
这将完全改变
I mean, that completely changes

585
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,120
我们对初始奇点的理解
how we understand the initial singularity.

586
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,990
这可是个永恒膨胀的系统
We're talking about an eternal inflation system.

587
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,950
那怎么行得通  那么多量...
How does that even work with all the quantum...?

588
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,150
真是疯了
It's insane.

589
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,350
抱歉  好酷啊
S-sorry. It's really cool.

590
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,060
不要为比其他人聪明而道歉
Don't ever apologize for being the smartest one in the room.

591
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,150
好了
Anyway...

592
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,920
它们诞生于黑洞中的稳定轨道
They were born in stable orbits within black holes.

593
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,190
是基本元素构成的生灵
Creatures formed from the primary elements:

594
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,790
气  水  火  土
Air, water, fire, earth.

595
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,320
科学部为它们起了学名
The Science Division had a technical name.

596
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,890
但我们喊它们元素怪
We just called them Elementals.

597
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:20,350
它们的变体普遍存在于我们的神话中
Versions of them exist across our mythologies.

598
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,090
原来传说都是真的
Turns out, the myths are real.

599
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,120
就像托尔
Like Thor.

600
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,020
托尔原是传说  但现在是我物理课的内容
Thor was a myth, and now I study him in my physics class.

601
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,790
这些传说是威胁
These myths are threats.

602
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,250
它们最初于多年前在我的地球上实体化
They first materialized on my Earth many years ago.

603
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,750
我们调动力量与它们交手
We mobilized and fought them,

604
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,260
但它们随着每场战斗愈发强大
but with each battle, they grew, got stronger.

605
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,620
我是仅剩的最后一支阻止它们的军团的一员
I was part of the last battalion left trying to stop them.

606
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,690
但我们只推迟了不可避免的结局
All we did was delay the inevitable.

607
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:45,090
元素怪又来到了这里  袭击相同的地点
The Elementals are here now, attacking the same coordinates.

608
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,350
卫星已证实了这点
Our satellites confirm it.

609
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,090
所以感谢贝克先生摧毁了另三个
So thank Mr. Beck for destroying the other three.

610
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,260
现在只剩一个了  火
There's only one left: fire.

612
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,220
摧毁了我的地球的那个
The one that destroyed my Earth.

613
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,790
也是杀死我家人的那个
It's the one that took my family.

614
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,490
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

615
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,390
再过大概48小时  它就会出现在布拉格
And it will be in Prague in approximately 48 hours.

616
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:09,350
我们只有一项任务  干掉它
We have one mission: kill it.

617
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,850
你要跟我们一起来
And you're coming with us.

618
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,090
抱歉  你是说布拉格吗

弗瑞先生  这似乎是很严重的事
Mr. Fury, this all seems like bigtime,

620
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,920
很重大的  超级英雄的那种事
you know, huge superhero kind of stuff.

621
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,720
我只是友好邻居蜘蛛侠  先生
And, I mean, I'm just a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.

622
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,590
少来了  你上过太空呢
Bitch, please. You've been to space.

623
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,730
我知道  但那是意外
I know, but that was an accident.

624
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,350
先生  拜托  你肯定还能找别人吧
Sir, come on. There's gotta be someone else you can use.

625
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,150
-托尔呢  -去别的世界了

别跟我提她
Don't invoke her name.

629
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,790
先生  我真的想帮忙的
Sir, look, I really wanna help. I do.

630
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,050
但如果我婶婶得知我离开了大部队
But if my aunt finds out I left my class trip,

631
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:41,890
她会杀了我的
she's gonna kill me.

632
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,190
经过了华盛顿纪念堂的事
And if I'm seen like this in Europe

633
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,250
如果我再这样在欧洲出现
after the Washington Monument,

634
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,590
我全班同学都会猜到我的身份
my whole class will figure out who I am, and then...

635
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,490
那全世界就都知道我的身份了
Then the whole world will figure out who I am,

636
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,590
我就完了
then I'm done.

637
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,820

你快回去吧  别被老师发现你不见了
Why don't you get back before your teachers miss you

641
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,590
起了疑心

What can I say?

794

会叫的轮子有升级油抹

你的战衣上有耳机
There's an earpiece with your suit.

800

戴上  等待进一步指示

803
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:51,920
如果我让你觉得
Look, I am so sorry

804
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,750
我只顾着自己恋爱  那很抱歉
if I seem like I'm preoccupied with my relationship.

805
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,020
我还是你的技术支援

806
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,950
不  没事  别担心

808
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:03,290
那些元素怪什么情况了
So, what's the status on the Elemental thing?

809
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,720
-会在哪里出现  -在这座城市里

我在想办法呢
It's... I'm figuring it out.

812
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,550
你得做点什么  彼得  拜托
You have to do something, Peter, please.

813
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,050
我们都指望你了

814
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,890
-内德  -来了  宝贝

816
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:19,290
-可算  -不是吧
- It's about time. - Serious?

817
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:22,120
-帕克  -是  先生
- Parker? Parker! - Yes, sir.

818
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,520
那玩意几小时后就来了
That thing is going to be here in a few hours.

819
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,990
-我们让你无聊了吗  -他不是无聊
- Are we boring you? - He's not bored.

820
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,740
他只是在想被你绑架来的事
He's just thinking about how you kidnapped him.

821
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,400
他有困难
He had obstacles.

822
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,140
我解决掉了困难
I removed them.

823
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,110
他们还是不肯疏散城市
And they still won't evacuate the city.

824
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,640
白痴
Idiots.

825
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:38,770
怎么办  帕克
So, what's the plan, Parker?

826
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,270
我去大教堂塔楼
I will be in the cathedral tower,

827
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:42,770
留意火怪的出现
keeping watch for the fire monster.

828
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:45,110
等它出现  我就呼叫你们
When that shows up, I will radio you guys,

829
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:48,400
-然后我和贝克先生  -我叫神秘客
- and then Mr. Beck and I will... - My name is Mysterio.

830
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:54,370
然后我和神秘客就冲上去
That's when Mysterio and I will move in.

831
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,740
彼得  听我说
Peter, listen to me.

832
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,070
最好的结果  唯一的好结果
The best hope you have, the only hope,

833
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:59,770
就是现在阻止它
is to stop it here now,

834
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,510
不惜一切
no matter what the cost.

835
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,770
尽量带他远离市民
Maneuver it away from civilians if you can,

836
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:07,140
但最重要的是让它远离金属
but most important, keep it away from metal.

837
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,300
如果它长得太大
If it gets too big,

838
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:10,600
就能开始汲取地球内核的力量
it'll be able to draw power from the Earth's core.

839
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:13,570
那样的话  它就不可阻挡了
After that, there's no way to stop it.

840
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,510
我的朋友都在这里呢
Hey, man, my friends are here.

841
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,740
我忍不住觉得我们给他们带来了危险
I can't help but think that we're putting them in danger.

842
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,970
你还担心我们伤害你的朋友
You're worried about us hurting your friends?

843
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,440
你  调动无人机袭击你自己的学校旅游大巴
You, who called a drone strike on your own school tour bus?

844
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:33,500
斯塔克给了你一套价值百万的
Stark gave you a multibillion-dollar

845
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,970
现实增强战术情报系统
A.R. Tactical intelligence system,

846
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:37,540
你首先就拿它
and the first thing you do with it

847
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,800
去炸你朋友
is try and blow up your friends.

848
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:43,970
在我看来  你显然没做好准备
It's clear to me that you were not ready for this.

849
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,340
弗瑞叫我来看看你
Fury asked me to come up here and see how you were doing.

850
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,740
他对冲你发脾气感到过意不去
He just... He felt bad about snapping at you.

851
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,570
是吗
Really?

852
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,570
这个地球上有反讽这回事吧
You guys do have sarcasm on this Earth, right?

853
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,140
你感觉怎么样
How you feeling?

854
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,710
我没想到我这个暑假还得拯救世界
I didn't think I was gonna have to save the world this summer.

855
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,900
我知道这话听上去很混蛋  但...
I know that makes me sound like such a jerk. I just...

856
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:17,240
我本来计划好了跟我喜欢的女孩...
I had this plan with this girl that I really like...

857
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:20,340
现在都毁了
and now it's all ruined.

858
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,240
想要正常生活不叫混蛋  孩子
You're not a jerk for wanting a normal life, kid.

859
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,570
这条路很艰辛
It's a hard path.

860
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,170
你会看到一些事  会做一些事
You see things. You do things.

861
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,540
你要做出选择
You make choices.

862
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:40,640
人们敬仰你
People look up to you...

863
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,270
即便你赢得战役  有时也会死人
and even if you win a battle, sometimes they die.

864
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,710
我喜欢你  彼得  你是个好孩子
I like you, Peter. You're a good kid.

865
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:52,140
我心里有些想对你说
There's a part of me that wants me to tell you, just...

866
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,900
转身离开这一切
turn around, run away from all this.

867
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,400
但我心里又清楚
Then there's another part of me

868
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,270
我们要对付的东西是什么样
that knows what we're about to fight,

869
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,510
这关乎到什么  我很高兴有你在
what's at stake, and I'm glad you're here.

870
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:04,540
我也是
Me too.

871
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,770
但你担心你的朋友
But you're worried about your friends.

872
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,940
对
Yeah.

873
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:11,400
我觉得我总害他们有危险
Just always feel like I'm putting them in danger.

874
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:14,600
让他们待在室内
Look, just get them inside

875
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,270
在安全处待几小时就行
and keep them in a safe place for just a few hours.

876
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:18,110
他们会没事的
They'll be all right.

877
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,970
能有个人一起聊聊
It's really nice to have somebody to talk to about

878
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,440
超级英雄的事真好
superhero stuff, you know?

879
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,240
不客气
Anytime.

880
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:30,200
如果我们活下来了
And, hey, we survive this,

881
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:32,010
你还有一整个暑假能杀布拉德呢
you'll have all summer to kill Brad.

882
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,900
待会儿见
See you out there.

883
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,070
好
All right.

884
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:43,670
对不起
Scusi.

885
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,340
抱歉  那是意大利语
Sorry, that's Italian.

886
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,700
好了  伊迪丝  快点
Okay. EDITH? Oh, come on.

887
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,770
你好  彼得
Hello, Peter.

888
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,900
我需要想个办法让我的朋友们
I need to find a way to keep my friends

889
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,270
接下来几小时待在室内
inside the next few hours.

890
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:57,670
我们想想办法吧
Let's see what we can do.

891
00:46:58,310 --> 00:46:59,440
好消息
Good news.

892
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,470
我们要去看歌剧
We're going to the opera!

893
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,170
-开什么玩笑  -歌剧
- You're kidding me. - The opera?

894
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:04,400
别看我
Don't look at me.

895
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,840
不是说去嘉年华吗
What happened to the carnival?

896
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,540
这就是升级人生
This is upgrade living, guys.

897
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:11,140
来嘛  门票是旅游公司送的
Come on. The tour company just gave us these tickets.

898
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,370
免费哦
For free!

899
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,400
你们知道歌剧门票多贵吗
Do you have any idea how much opera tickets cost?

900
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,140
不知道
No,

901
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:18,870
因为我们没有人想去看歌剧  从来不想
because none of us have ever wanted to go to the opera, ever.

902
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,900
我觉得这是我们增长文化知识的好机会
Well, I think this is gonna be culturally enriching for us.

903
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,040
谢谢  内德
Thank you, Ned.

904
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,570
各位  这或许将是
Everyone, this is gonna be, maybe,

905
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,540
我们整个旅程中最棒的四小时
the best four hours of our whole trip.

906
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,970
四小时
Four hours?

907
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:33,670
各位  我觉得这会很好玩的  真的
Guys, I think this is gonna be fun. Seriously.

908
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,200
你们肯定都庆幸我让你们带身好衣服了吧
I bet now you're all happy that I had you pack a nice outfit.

909
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:41,870
是啊  因为我们更想去看四小时的歌剧
Yeah, because we'd much rather go to a four-hour opera

910
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:43,740
而不是全世界最大的派对
instead of the biggest party in the world.

911
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,710
再说一次  跟我无关
Again, don't look at me.

912
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:48,010
帕克  收到吗
Parker, do you copy?

通讯检查  一  二
Comm check, one, two.

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,870
好  我们到了
Okay, here we are.

921
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,840
因此我才有价值吗
And therefore, I have value?

922
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,770
不  我完全不是那意思
No. No, that's not what I meant at all. I was just...

923
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,040
我在逗你呢
I'm messing with you.

924
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,370

Want to go in on a pair?

00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:35,800
我们坐一起吗
You mean, sit next to each other?

930
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:36,610
好啊

{\an8}为什么没有  帕克
Why the hell not? Parker?

934
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:42,870
你不想跟我坐一起吗
You don't want to sit next to me,

935
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,140
还是不想要眼镜
or, no, you just don't want the glasses?

936
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:46,400
我不是那意思
I didn't mean that.

937
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,900
你先去吧  我去给我们买一副
If you go ahead, I'll go grab us a pair.

你能跟MJ说我病了什么的吗
Could you just tell MJ that I'm sick or something?

945
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,400
好吧  小心点
Okay. Be careful.

963
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,770
很好  很棒
The suit's great. It's awesome.

964
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:16,340
射网处有点紧
It's a little tight around the old web-shooter.

965
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:16,920
帕克
Parker!

966
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:18,300

-怎么了  -老实说

970
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,400
我不是很适应人多  要不我们...
I don't do well with big crowds, so maybe we should...

971
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,040
我知道怎么办
I have the perfect thing.

972
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,070
走
Come on.

973
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,100
别担心  宝贝
Don't worry, babe.

974
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,740
我们能远离人群  呼吸点新鲜空气
We'll get away from the crowds, get some fresh air.

975
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:46,710
你会感觉好得多的
You'll feel a thousand times better.

976
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:52,670
能量激增
Energy spiking.

977
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:54,270

Do you think that's Spider-Man?

987
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:44,490
不不不
No, no, no.

00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,170
那是他的欧洲山寨货
It's a European rip-off version of him.

00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,400
我前两天还看他的报道了  不是他
I was actually read about him the other day. It's not him.

990
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,860
不  贝克  他吸收了旋转木马
No, Beck! He's got the carousel!

991
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,940
他在变大了
He's getting bigger!

992
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,010
他叫什么
What's his name? What's his name?

蜘蛛侠  保持距离

1013
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,670

1015
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:20,570
就这样  好样的  你打中它了
That's it! Nice! Nice! You got him!

1016
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:28,640
不不不
No, no, no.

1017
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:36,340
太迟了
It's too late.

1018
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:39,070
不管发生什么
Whatever happens...

1019
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,240
很高兴我们相识一场
I'm glad we met.

1020
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,470
贝克  你要干什么
Beck, what are you doing?

1021
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,800
我上次该干的事
What I should have done last time.

1022
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,540
贝克  别
Beck, don't do it!

1023
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:58,770
贝克
Beck!

1024
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:20,140
贝克先生
Mr. Beck?

1025
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,540
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

1026
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,740
我真想亲你
I would totally kiss you,

1027
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:37,070
但我觉得我刚有点吐在嘴里了
but I think I just threw up in my mouth a little.

1028
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:42,470
我可能有薄荷糖
I might have a mint.

1029
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:45,440
结束了吗
So it's over?

1030
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:46,900
那是最后一个了
That was the last of them.

1031
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,640
但不会是我们最后一次面临威胁
But not the last threat we'll ever face.

1032
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,070
我们得保持警惕
We need to stay vigilant.

1033
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,740
这世界正缺你这样的人
There's a void in this world for someone like you.

1034
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:00,270
希尔和我明天要去柏林的欧警总部
Hill and I are going to Europol headquarters in Berlin tomorrow.

1035
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,900

你有天赋  帕克
You got gifts, Parker,

1038
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:20,370
但你不想来
but you didn't wanna be here.

1039
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:21,100
弗瑞先生
Mr. Fury, I...

1040
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,670
我希望你也能去柏林
I'd love to have you in Berlin too.

1041
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:28,340
但你得想好  你要不要挺身而出
But you got to decide whether you're going to step up or not.

1042
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:30,800
斯塔克选了你
Stark chose you.

1043
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,070
他让你做了复仇者
He made you an Avenger.

1044
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:35,240
我需要那个
I need that.

1045
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:38,470
世界也需要
The world needs that.

1046
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,400
或许斯塔克错了
Maybe Stark was wrong.

1047
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:44,870
是吗
Was he?

1048
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,740
选择权在你
The choice is yours.

1049
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:04,540
我们去喝一杯吧
Let's get a drink.

1050
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,370
我没到21
I'm not 21.

1051
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,840
你该庆祝  我们今晚做了好事
You gotta celebrate. We did something good tonight.

1052
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,110
是啊
Yeah.

1053
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,610
弗瑞是对的
Fury was right.

1054
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,070
托尼为我做了好多事
Tony did a lot for me, so...

1055
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,040
我欠他的  欠大家的
I owe it to him, to everybody.

1056
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:33,670
是吗
Do you?

1057
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,840
对
Yeah. I mean...

1058
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:40,540
斯塔克先生给了我成长的机会
Mr. Stark gave me the chance to be more.

1059
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,370
他希望我做的比他好
He wanted me to be better than him.

1060
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,140
弗瑞希望我不负他的期望
And Fury just wants me to live up to that.

1061
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,740
那你想要什么  彼得
What do you want, Peter?

1062
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:47,840
-什么意思  -你想要什么
- What do you mean? - What do you want?

1063
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,400
我不知道
I don't know.

1064
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,970
你想要什么  彼得·帕克  就现在
What do you want? You, Peter Parker. Now.

1065
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:53,770
我知道你在想
I know you're thinking about it.

1066
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,670
我想去旅我的行
I wanna go on my trip, right?

1067
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:57,970
我想回去跟朋友们一起旅行
I want to go back on my trip with my friends.

1068
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,900
跟我喜欢的姑娘
And go to the top of the Eiffel Tower

1069
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:04,570
去埃菲尔铁塔顶层  然后向她告白
with the girl who I really like and tell her how I feel, and...

1070
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,670
吻她
give her a kiss.

1071
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:09,640
闭嘴啦
Shut up, man.

1072
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:11,940
你不会那么做  是吧
You're not gonna do that, are you?

1073
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,700
-我不能  -为什么不能
- No, I can't. - Why not?

1074
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:15,940
因为我还有太多责任
Because I have too much of a responsibility.

1075
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,370
-天啊  非常感谢  -那是什么
- Oh, my God. Thank you so much. - What are those?

1076
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,200
-那是...  -伊迪丝眼镜  是啊
- Are those the...? - EDITH glasses, yeah.

1077
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,440
之前掉地上了吗
They were just on the floor?

1078
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,840
戴上试试  让我看看
Try them on. Let's see how they look like.

1079
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,840
-是吗  -嗯
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1080
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:32,270
我还挺喜欢的
I actually really like them.

1081
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:34,040
我能跟你说实话吗
Can I be completely honest with you?

1082
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:34,770
请吧
Please.

1083
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,770
丑爆了
They look really stupid.

1084
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:40,670
但或许还有隐形眼镜版本的
But maybe they have a contact-lens version.

1085
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:42,170
你戴上试试
You try them on.

1086
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,040
-不  得了  -试试嘛
- No, come on. - Try them on.

1087
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:46,170
-我不想戴  -戴上试试嘛
- I don't wanna try them on. - Just put them on.

1088
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:55,170
你觉得怎么样  孩子
What do you think, kid?

1089
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:02,000
"下一个托尼·斯塔克  我信任你"
"Next Tony Stark, I trust you."

1090
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:06,000
"给下一个托尼·斯塔克  我信任你"
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

1091
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:06,870
什么
What?

1092
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:09,130
斯塔克先生给我留下眼镜时还有段话
Mr Stark left me a message with those glasses:

1093
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,350
"给下一个托尼·斯塔克  我信任你"
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

1094
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:13,980
我还是不懂  你喝了几杯柠檬汁
I'm still not following. How many lemonades have you had?

1095
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:15,790
他知道我犯过的每个错误
He knew every mistake I ever made.

1096
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:18,790
他肯定也知道我还没做好这个准备
So, he must've known that I wasn't ready for something like this.

1097
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:19,950
那他为什么要把眼镜给你
Why would he give it to you?

1098
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:21,560
因为或许他不是把伊迪丝托付给了我
Because maybe he didn't trust me to have EDITH,

1099
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,540
而是托付我选个应该拥有它的人
he just trusted me to pick who should.

1100
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,290
这要合理多了  他一向知道我会做正确选择
It makes much more sense. He always knew I'd do what's right.

1101
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:27,420
他不会把眼镜给弗瑞的
And he's not gonna give them to Fury

1102
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,930
因为弗瑞只会自己留着伊迪丝
because Fury would give himself EDITH.

1103
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:31,220
这你八成是说对了
You're probably right about that.

1104
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,970
是啊  所以世界需要下一个钢铁侠
Right, so the world needs the next Iron Man.

1105
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:37,640
那不会是我的  我是个皇后区来的16岁孩子
And it's not me. I mean, I'm a 16-year-old kid from Queens.

1106
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,510
得是个大人  有经验
It needs to be an adult with some experience

1107
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,790
就像托尼·斯塔克一样好  比如你
and that's good like Tony Stark, like you.

1108
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,000
不  彼得  得了
No. Peter, come on.

1109
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:46,920
不行
No.

1110
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:50,670
-伊迪丝  -你好  彼得
- EDITH? - Hello, Peter.

1111
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:52,030
嗯
Yeah, um...

1112
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:56,250
我想把你的控制权交给昆廷·贝克
I'd like to transfer your control over to Quentin Beck.

1113
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,820
-彼得  你干什么呢  -做正确的事
- Peter, what are you doing? - Doing the right thing.

1114
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,450
移交控制权需要确认
Any transfer will require confirmation.

1115
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,200
斯塔克把眼镜给了你
Stark gave you the glasses.

1116
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,280
斯塔克给了我个选择
Stark gave me a choice.

1117
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,380
这是我要做的选择  我现在要选了
It's my choice to make. Okay? I'm gonna make it.

1118
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:09,190
你是个士兵  是领袖  你阻止了元素怪
Look, you're a soldier, a leader. You stopped the Elementals.

1119
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:12,130
你救了我  救了世界  好吗
You saved my life. You saved the world, okay?

1120
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,570
他会希望你拿着眼镜的
He'd want you to have them.

1121
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,390
等待确认
Waiting for confirmation.

1122
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:16,420
确认
Confirm.

1123
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,890
欢迎加入复仇者联盟
Welcome to the Avengers.

1124
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,250
你戴挺帅的
They look good on you.

1125
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:34,010
谢谢
Thank you.

1126
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:35,440
很荣幸
It's an honor.

1127
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,160
嗯
Yeah.

1128
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,360
斯塔克先生真的会喜欢你的
Mr. Stark would've really liked you.

1129
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,630
-你去哪  -去找MJ
- Where you headed? - I'm gonna go find MJ.

1130
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:47,390
祝你好运  孩子  我觉得你有一半机会
Good luck, kid. I'll give you about a fifty-fifty chance.

1131
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:48,860
你挺别扭的
You're pretty awkward. So...

1132
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:50,510
嗯
Yeah.

1133
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:53,110
-回见了  -回见
- See you later, man. - See you.

1134
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:27,290
瞧  并不难吧
See? That wasn't so hard.

1135
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:28,400
太好了
Yes!

1136
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:32,500
谁帮我褪下这身破戏服
Somebody get this stupid costume off me!

1137
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:40,820
好  我们拿到伊迪丝了
Okay, we got EDITH.

1138
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,460
把这个连上我们的系统
Get these connected to our system.

1139
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:45,050
敬酒
Toast! Toast! Toast!

1140
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:48,220
这是场重大胜利  但我们的任务还很艰巨
Now, this is a big win, but we still got a lot of work to do.

1141
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:49,970
敬酒
Toast! Toast! Toast!

1142
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:51,520
好啊
Yeah!

1143
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,780
好吧  敬一杯
Okay, toasts!

1144
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,230
给我  道格
Give me that, Doug.

1145
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,340
敬让我们走到一起的人
To the man who brought us all together,

1146
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,370
我们的前老板  托尼·斯塔克
our former boss, Tony Stark.

1147
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,200
小丑国王
The jester king.

1148
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:06,810
被财富和科技包裹
Literally wrapped in wealth and technology

1149
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:09,260
他却不配使用它们
that he was unfit to wield.

1150
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:11,280
就像我设计的全息系统
Like the holographic system I designed.

1151
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,880
那是革命性的突破
A revolutionary breakthrough

1152
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,200
有无限的应用前景
with limitless applications

1153
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,530
却被托尼变成了自我治疗机器  还改名叫...
that Tony turned into a self-therapy machine and renamed...

1154
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:21,290
二进制增强记忆重塑工具  简称"二重"[吐]
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF.

1155
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:28,410
我这个治疗实验花费了6.11亿美元
$611 million for my little therapeutic experiment.

1156
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:31,760
他把我的毕生心血改名叫
He renamed my life's work...

1157
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:32,650
"二重"
"Barf."

1158
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,310
我对他说这是个错误
I told him it was a mistake,

1159
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:36,350
我的科技可以改变世界
that my technology could change the world.

1160
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:38,800
然后
And then...

1161
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:41,240
他解雇了我
he fired me.

1162
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:44,160
说我...
Said I was...

1163
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:46,700
不稳定
unstable.

1164
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:49,540
敬托尼
To Tony.

1165
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:51,340
敬托尼
To Tony!

1166
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:53,300
接下来  敬威廉
Next, to William.

1167
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:54,760
威廉
William!

1168
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,810
托尼·斯塔克在一个山洞里就造成了
Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave!

1169
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,910
用的是一堆破烂
With a box of scraps!

1170
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:03,390
我的幻景科技和你的
The integration of my illusion tech

1171
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,740
武器化无人机的结合简直绝妙
with your weaponized drones was brilliant.

1172
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:08,520
强大幻景  真实摧毁  屡试不爽
Powerful illusions, real damage, worked like a charm.

1173
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,700
而这还只是开始
And it's just the beginning.

1174
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,720
-谢谢  兄弟  -敬古特曼
- Thank you, brother. - To Guterman.

1175
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:13,070
-古特曼  -敬古特曼
- Guterman! - To Guterman!

1176
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:14,180
你编写的故事
The story you created

1177
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:16,000
一个来自另一个地球的战士昆廷
of a soldier from another Earth named Quentin

1178
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,370
在欧洲跟太空怪物战斗  简直荒谬至极
fighting space monsters in Europe is totally ridiculous

1179
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:20,840
可看来现在
and apparently exactly the kind of thing

1180
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,180
大家就信这一套了
people would believe right now.

1181
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:23,790
所有人都信了
I mean, everybody bought it.

1182
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:25,520
-古特  -古特曼
- Gutes! - Guterman!

1183
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,510
-敬维多利亚  -敬维多利亚
- To Victoria. - To Victoria!

1184
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,750
在每个袭击点制造电磁脉冲
Staging electromagnetic pulses at each attack site

1185
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:32,270
让弗瑞的卫星确认我们的谎言
so Fury's own satellites would confirm our lies.

1186
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:34,030
好点子
Inspired idea.

1187
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:36,090
-敬詹妮丝  -詹妮丝
- To Janice. - Janice!

1188
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:38,430
托尼死后  是她发现了
After Tony died, she was the one who discovered that

1189
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:40,340
伊迪丝没有被交给我们
EDITH was being handed over not to us,

1190
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:42,290
或是国防部
not to the Defense Department,

1191
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:43,700
而是给了个孩子
but to a child.

1192
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,460
-谢谢  -敬詹妮丝
- Thank you. - To Janice!

1193
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:47,750
也敬你们其他人  托尼·斯塔克死了
And to the rest of you, Tony Stark is gone.

1194
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:51,240
现在有个机会  会有人站出来的
There's a window of opportunity, and someone will step up.

1195
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:53,900
但现如今  哪怕你是在场最聪明的人
But these days, you can be the smartest guy in the room,

1196
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:56,350
最有资质的人  也没人在乎
the most qualified, and no one cares.

1197
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:58,220
除非你披着斗篷飞
Unless you're flying around with a cape

1198
01:03:58,220 --> 01:03:59,970
或是手能发出激光
or shooting lasers from your hands,

1199
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:02,510
否则根本没人听你说话
no one will even listen.

1200
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:08,270
我现在有斗篷和激光了
Well, I've got a cape and lasers.

1201
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:11,150
凭借我们的科技  和伊迪丝
With our technology and with EDITH,

1202
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:16,060
神秘客将成为地球上最伟大的英雄
Mysterio will be the greatest hero on Earth!

1203
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,330
好啊
Yeah!

1204
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:20,050
到时所有人都得听着
Then everyone will listen!

1205
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:24,810
不是听一个酗酒的巨婴
Not to a boozy man-child.

1206
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:26,120
不
No!

1207
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:29,000
也不是听一个青春期少年
Not to a hormonal teenager.

丢进水里淹死
and they would drown in the water.

It's kind of obvious.

1281
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:58,270
我不是蜘蛛侠
I'm not Spider-Man.

1282
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,010
你为什么会觉得我是蜘蛛侠
What would make you think that I was Spider-Man?

1283
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:02,160
-彼得  华盛顿  -怎么了

1289
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:14,050
那你就是蜘蛛侠
Well, then you're Spider-Man.

1290
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:17,270
-不  我才不是蜘蛛侠  -那今晚呢
- No, I'm not Spider-Man at all. - What about tonight?

1291
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:19,460
你溜出去  跟那怪物打斗  我看到了
You snuck off and you fought that thing. I saw you.

1292
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,970
你不可能看到我  因为我不是蜘蛛侠
You can't have seen me because I'm not Spider-Man.

01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:30,710
新闻从不撒谎

夜猴侠和蜘蛛侠
Well, do the Night Monkey and Spider-Man

1300
01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:39,830

I mean, maybe.

1302
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:44,910
或许他是只蜘蛛猿  谁知道呢
Maybe he's a Spider Monkey. Who knows?

1303
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:50,740
你看我
Were you only watching me

1304
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,450
只是因为你以为我是蜘蛛侠吗
because you thought I was Spider-Man?

1305
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,430
对啊
Yeah.

1306
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:59,530
要不然我为什么要看你
Why else would I be watching you?

1307
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:02,820
无所谓了
Doesn't matter.

1308
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,050
就是以为...
Just thought that maybe...

1309
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,130
那怎么回事
What the hell was that?

1310
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:14,950
我不知道
I don't know.

1311
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:28,980
那是什么投影仪吗
What is it, like some kind of projector or something?

1312
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:32,390
对  但非常先进
Yeah, but it's really advanced.

1313
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:34,880

是啊  非常真
Yeah, really real.

1315
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:41,240
-等等  那么说...  -元素怪是假的
- Wait, does that mean that...? - The Elementals are fake?

1316
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,370
但那没道理  因为我们在场的
That doesn't make any sense because we were there, right?

1317
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:47,610
现场有火  还造成了毁灭
There was fire and destruction, and...

1318
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:50,960
谁会做出那种事啊
Who would do something like that?

1319
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:01,880
神秘客
Mysterio.

1320
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,030
我是蜘蛛侠
I am Spider-Man.

1321
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,630
我坏大事了
And I've really messed up.

1322
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:13,370
等等  你现在说真的吗
Wait. You're b-being serious right now?

1323
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:15,350
你没开玩笑  你百分百认真的吗
You're not joking with me? Like, you're 100 percent serious?

1324
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:17,190
-因为这不好笑  -我没开玩笑
- Because it's not funny. - No, I'm not joking.

1325
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:19,650
因为我本来只有67%确定
Because I was only like 67 percent sure.

1326
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:21,500
-MJ  -那你为什么在这儿

你为什么来参加学校旅游
Why are you on this school trip?

1328
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,460
MJ  我知道你有千万个问题
MJ, look, I know you have a lot of questions,

1329
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:26,300
但我们真得走了

1330
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:29,900
好  真不敢相信我猜到了
Okay. Okay. I can't believe I figured it out!

1331
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:33,450
你夺走了我的一切
You took everything from me!

1332
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,170
这是为了我家人
This is for my family!

Pause. I'm not in love with this choreography,

1340
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:04,470

we'll be able to create an event big enough to cover an entire city.

1360
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,850
好样的  确保每台无人机都武器就绪
All right. Well done. Make sure every drone is weapons-hot.

1361
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:01,960
我们需要最大破坏
We need maximum damage.

1362
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,670
-那会死伤惨重的  -当然
- That's gonna cause a lot of casualties. - Oh, yeah.

1363
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:07,490
伤亡大  报道多  我得盖过其他新闻
More casualties, more coverage. I gotta cut through the static.

1364
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,310
伦敦是座美丽的城市  它会遭殃
London's a beautiful city, and it'll suffer,

1365
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:12,190
但他们能重建  如果我想做下个钢铁侠
but they can rebuild. I mean, if I'm gonna be the next Iron Man,

1366
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:15,300
我得在复仇者级别的威胁下拯救世界
I need to save the world from an Avengers-level threat.

1367
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:19,870
但等它的新救世主到来
But when its new savior descends,

1368
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:22,410
那些伤亡都会被遗忘
all those casualties will be forgotten.

1369
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,910
詹妮丝  你要就位  准备让我速换盔甲
Janice, you'll be in position with my quick-change armor

1370
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:27,070
-去迎接胜利  -没问题
- for the victory lap? - Of course.

1371
01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:28,950
-你想试试...  -不
- You wanna try...? - No, that's...

1372
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,860
我的手怎么了  怎么会这样
What's going on with my hand? Why is that happening?

1373
01:12:32,170 --> 01:12:33,920
从广场上回来的一台无人机
One of the drones that came back from the plaza

1374
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,760
丢了个投影仪  没事的
was missing a projector. It's fine.

1375
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:39,120
等等  你...你才告诉我吗
Wait, and you're...? You're telling me this now?

1376
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:43,020
就一台无人机  图像不会有问题的  我保证
It's one drone. The image will be perfect, I promise.

1377
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,390
那台投影仪是证据
That projector is evidence.

1378
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:45,550
能让人们知道我们在做什么
It's gonna tell people what we're doing

1379
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:46,730
怎么做到的
and how we're doing it.

1380
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:50,060
我可是在努力骗过70亿人
I am trying to fool 7 billion people here,

1381
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:52,650
包括尼克·弗瑞  他可是全世界最多疑
including Nick Fury, who happens to be the most paranoid

1382
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:54,790
也最危险的人
and most dangerous person on the planet.

1383
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:56,630
如果他在我杀了他前发现了
And if he catches on before I've killed him,

1384
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:58,030
他会一枪崩了我的脑袋
and he will put a bullet in my head.

1385
01:12:58,030 --> 01:13:00,470
没人想被一枪崩了脑袋  是吧
And nobody wants a bullet in their head, right?

1386
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:03,650
是吧
Right?

1387
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:07,770
威廉  你看着我
William, can you look at me?

1388
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,210
调出伊迪丝
Pull up EDITH.

1389
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:14,400
你好  昆廷
Hello, Quentin.

1390
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,190
亲爱的  启动五级搜索
Hi, honey. I need a level-five search,

1391
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:18,130
全资源协议  查找这个装置
full-resource protocol for this device.

1392
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:19,490
正在放大
Magnifying.

1393
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:23,230
那里  搜索进出那栋建筑的一切
There. Search everything going in and out of that building.

1394
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:25,210
已找到
Located.

1395
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:27,840
该死
Shit.

1396
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:33,170
威廉  有一天
You know, William, one day,

1397
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:35,890
等我因为这个不得不杀了彼得·帕克
after I've had to kill Peter Parker because of this,

1398
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:39,890
我希望你记得  他的血是沾在你手上的
I hope you remember that his blood is on your hands!

1399
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,230
真不敢相信我把眼镜给了贝克
I can't believe I gave Beck those glasses.

1400
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:46,590
我怎么能那么蠢
I mean, how could I be that stupid?

1401
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,260
他大概此刻正在监视我
He's probably spying on me right now

1402
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:50,170
或是派无人机来杀我
or sending a drone to come and kill me.

1403
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:53,060
你还能调用杀人无人机吗
You had access to killer drones?

1404
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:54,240
对  我并没想要的
Yeah, I didn't really want them,

1405
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,250
尤其是在我差点杀了布拉德之后
especially after I almost killed Brad.

1406
01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:58,260
你差点杀了布拉德
You almost killed Brad?

1407
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:00,190
听着  我得打给弗瑞先生
Look, I have to call Mr. Fury

1408
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:01,830
告诉他贝克是骗子
and tell him that Beck's a fraud, but...

1409
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:03,350
但他应该监听了我的电话
I think he tapped my phone.

1410
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:04,710
好吧  那你怎么办
Okay. So, what are you gonna do?

1411
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:06,660
我需要我的战衣
I need my suit,

1412
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:09,980
我得去柏林  跟弗瑞先生当面说
and I have to go to Berlin and talk to Mr. Fury in person.

1413
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:15,750
那个...
Just...

1414
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:36,740
内德  太好了
Ned, perfect.

1415
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:38,860
这戏服太棒了
The costume looks great...

1416
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,600
穿去化装舞会太合适了
for the costume party

1417
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,990
就在王子城堡
at the prince's castle.

1418
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,370
她知道了  我告诉她了
She knows. I told her.

1419
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,940
不是他告诉我的  是我猜到的
He didn't tell me. I figured it out.

1420
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:51,420
太棒了
That's cool.

1421
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:52,960
老早就猜到了
Like, a long time ago.

1422
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,120
神秘客是个骗子
Look, Mysterio is a fraud.

1423
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:58,450
但他救了我和贝蒂
But he saved me and Betty's lives.

1424
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:00,520
不  他用幻景科技伪造了整件事
No. He's been faking the whole thing with illusion tech.

1425
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:03,380
对  他使用了全息投影仪
Yeah, he's using these, like, hologram projectors.

1426
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:05,860
真疯狂
That's crazy.

1427
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:06,810
是啊
Yeah.

1428
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:12,390
所以你们是要一起查案吗
So you guys were like working the case together or what?

1429
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:13,580
主要是靠我
It's been mostly me.

1430
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:16,450
内德  打给梅  让她打给哈林顿老师
Look, Ned, I need you to call May, get her to call Mr. Harrington,

1431
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:18,350
说她希望我去柏林亲戚家住
say that she wanted me to stay with family in Berlin,

1432
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:19,680
等待风波过去  好吗
until this all blows over. Okay?

1433
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,910
好的  轻松
Got it. Easy.

1434
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:23,240
你们撒谎真是驾轻就熟
You guys lie with such ease.

1435
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:24,850
我得走了
I gotta go.

1436
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,110
等等  投影仪
Wait, wait, wait. The projector.

1437
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,520
你会需要这个的
You're gonna need this.

1438
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,320
别跟任何人说
Don't tell anyone about this, okay?

1439
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:32,870
知道的人都会有危险
Anyone who knows is in danger.

1440
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:42,380
所以  你也知道了
So you know too.

1441
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:45,730
真酷  虽然是我先知道的  而且要更早
It's cool. I mean, I've known first, and I've known longer,

1442
01:15:45,730 --> 01:15:47,290
但又不是什么竞争
but it's not a competition.

1443
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,640
不好意思  你知道哪...
Excuse me. Do you know where...?

1444
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:13,890
-夜猴侠  -不  等等  我不...天啊
- Nacht Monkey! - No, wait, I didn't... Oh, man.

1445
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:17,490
上车
Get in.

1446
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:24,990
弗瑞先生
Mr. Fury...

1447
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:27,630
你要解释很多事了
You've got a lot of explaining to do.

1448
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:29,780
-不不  听着  -等安全了再说
- No, no, no, listen. - Wait until we're secure.

1449
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:31,170
好
Okay.

1450
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:37,470
对哦
Right.

1451
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:06,590
你要跟我们说说
So is there anything you want to tell us

1452
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:07,720
你的女朋友吗
about your girlfriend?

1453
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,210
他是指伊迪丝
He's talking about EDITH.

1454
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:10,830
我知道我犯了个错误  我很抱歉
Look, I know I made a mistake, I'm sorry,

1455
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:12,390
但他不是你想的那样
but he is not who you think he is.

1456
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:14,570
贝克是个骗子  神秘客  元素怪
Beck is a liar. Mysterio, the Elementals,

1457
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:16,890
都是假的  他有种幻景科技
it's all fake. He has some illusion tech.

1458
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:19,830
他就是这样骗了你们  还骗我把伊迪丝交给了他
And that's how he tricked you guys, and me into giving him EDITH.

1459
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:21,290
这是个投影仪
It's a projector.

1460
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:23,860
我从布拉格的火怪身上拽下来的
I pulled it off the fire monster in Prague.

1461
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:27,220
我们看到的一切死亡和毁灭
So all that death and destruction we witnessed

1462
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:28,850
都是这个假造的
was created by this?

1463
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:31,490
不  不光是这个  我觉得他在用无人机
No, not just this. I think he's using drones.

1464
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:32,970
如果真是如此
Well, if this is true,

1465
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:36,430
那贝克就非常危险  我们也得机智应对
then Beck's very dangerous and we need to be smart.

1466
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:38,200
你还告诉谁了
Who else did you tell about this?

1467
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,260
帕克  帕克
Parker? Parker!

1468
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:43,920
-怎么了  -贝克  他在这儿
- What's wrong? - It's Beck. He's here.

1469
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:46,440
什么  希尔
What? Hill?

1470
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,330
不  只是幻...
No, it's just an illu...

1471
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,150
弗瑞
Fury!

1472
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:01,940
彼得
Peter.

1473
01:18:03,390 --> 01:18:04,770
我以为我们很要好呢
I thought we were close.

1474
01:18:05,530 --> 01:18:08,820
弗瑞本就必须死  但你不一样
Fury always had to die, but not you.

1475
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:10,510
别躲了  贝克
Stop hiding, Beck!

1476
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:14,730
我本想帮你离开这一切
I tried to help you walk away.

1477
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,780
这下你逼我不得不动手了
Now you're making me do this.

1478
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,440
是你说  你只是个孩子
You told me, you were just a kid.

1479
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,990
是你说  你想去追那姑娘
You told me, you wanted to run after that girl.

1480
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,370
-救命  -MJ
- Help me! - MJ!

1481
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:32,860
天啊
Oh, God!

1482
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:36,840
彼得  怎么回事
Peter, what's going on?

1483
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,370
我知道这是假的
I know this isn't real.

1484
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,820
你确定吗
Do you, though?

1485
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:41,860
MJ
MJ!

1486
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:43,410
MJ
MJ!

1487
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:49,060
我看你分不清真假了  彼得
I don't think you know what's real, Peter.

1488
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:03,850
你需要醒过来
You need to wake up!

1489
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,370
看看你自己
I mean, look at yourself.

1490
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:42,120
你只是个害怕的孩子
You are just a scared little kid

1491
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,660
穿着件运动衫
in a sweat suit.

1492
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:46,450
我创造了神秘客
I created Mysterio

1493
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:50,140
好给世界一个可以信仰的人
to give the world someone to believe in.

1494
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:51,690
我控制真相
I control the truth.

1495
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:54,700
神秘客就是真相
Mysterio is the truth.

1496
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,500
如果你真够好
If you were good enough,

1497
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,870
或许托尼就不会死了
maybe Tony would still be alive.

1498
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:38,330
内心深处  你知道我是对的
Deep down, you know I'm right.

1499
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,240
你自己做了选择
You made your choice.

1500
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:53,420
你只需要让位
And all you had to do was step aside.

1501
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:57,500
现在你...
And now you have...

1502
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:10,090
弗瑞
Fury.

1503
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:13,520
贝克的人想找到
Beck's people are trying to find

1504
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:15,670
所有能曝光他们的人
everyone who could expose him.

1505
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:17,870
你告诉谁了
Who'd you tell?

1506
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,780

1568
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:27,680

1585
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:18,590
所以别叫我放松

都能看到他的脸
I see his face.

1591

全世界都在问
And the whole world is asking

1592
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,410
谁会做下一个钢铁侠
who's gonna be the next Iron Man... And

1593
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:47,610
我不知道那是不是我  哈皮  我不是钢铁侠
I don't know if that's me, Happy. I'm not Iron Man.

1594
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:51,380
你不是钢铁侠
You're not Iron Man.

1595
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:54,300
你也不会成为钢铁侠
You're never gonna be Iron Man.

1596
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,030
没人能达到托尼的境界
Nobody could live up to Tony.

1597
01:26:58,890 --> 01:26:59,920
托尼都不能
Not even Tony.

1598
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:03,100
托尼是我最好的朋友
Tony was my best friend.

1599
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:04,980
但他状态很糟
And he was a mess.

1600
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:07,040
他总质疑自己做的一切
He second-guessed everything he did.

1601
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,600
心里乱得很
He was all over the place.

1602
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:11,450
他唯一没质疑过的抉择
The one thing that he did that he didn't second-guess

1603
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:12,500
就是选你
was picking you.

1604
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:17,200
我觉得托尼那么做
I don't think Tony would have done what he did

1605
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:19,790
是因为他知道等他不在了
if he didn't know that you were gonna be here

1606
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:20,900
你肯定会挺身而出
after he was gone.

1607
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,380
你的朋友们有麻烦了
Now, your friends are in trouble,

1608
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,360
你孤身一人  你的装备不见了
you're all alone, your tech is missing.

1609
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:30,820
你打算怎么办
What are you gonna do about it?

1610
01:27:36,630 --> 01:27:37,770
我要去扁他
I'm gonna kick his ass.

1611
01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:41,170
我是指现在  我们具体要做什么
I mean, right now. Like specifically, what are we gonna do?

1612
01:27:41,170 --> 01:27:42,950
因为我们在一片郁金香花田上空
Because we've been hovering over a tulip field

1613
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:44,110
悬停15分钟了
for the last 15 minutes.

1614
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:45,900
好吧  我不能给我的朋友们打电话
Right. I can't call my friends

1615
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,290
因为他在追踪他们的手机
because he's tracking their phones.

1616
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:48,590
把你的手机给我
Give me your phone.

1617
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,080

不  你的密码是什么
No, what is your password?

1622
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,640
"密码"这个词
"Password," Spelled out, password.

1623
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:58,480
你作为安全主管
You're the head of security,

1624
01:27:58,490 --> 01:27:59,730
居然用"密码"做密码
and your password is "Password"?

1625
01:27:59,730 --> 01:28:01,040
我也挺不好意思的
I don't feel good about it either.

1626
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,560

1641
01:29:19,370 --> 01:29:22,360
让我完全手控爆炸
and give me complete manual control over detonation.

1642
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:27,260
我以为克里人的潜伏间谍
I thought Kree having sleeper cells

1643
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:28,300
是绝密情报
was top secret information.

1645

1649
01:29:38,410 --> 01:29:40,740
然后我们吃口饭  就去机场

1650
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:46,310
没有人打算说说这一切多疯狂吗
Is no one else gonna acknowledge how crazy this is?

1651
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:48,680
我懂  这趟科学游
Oh, yeah, I get it. There's been nothing scientific

1652
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:50,370
完全不科学

1653
01:29:50,370 --> 01:29:52,070
不不  我是在说彼得

难道没别人注意到他多可疑吗
Has no one else here noticed how shady he is?

1655

在一个休息站的后屋里

1657
01:29:57,850 --> 01:29:59,430
而且他总偷偷溜走
and he's always sneaking away,

1658
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,460
比如在歌剧院时
like back at the opera, huh?

1659
01:30:01,470 --> 01:30:03,130
现在他又突然离队
And, now what, he's suddenly off the trip,

1660
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:04,840
去柏林找亲戚了
like with his family in Berlin?

1661
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:07,410
难道没有别人想知道真相吗
Is no one else here interested in the truth?

1662
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:10,970
"客观事实的概念
"The very concept of objective truth

1663
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:12,430
都在从这世上消失"
is fading out of the world."

1665
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:16,890
是啊  既然彼得不在
Yeah. Well, I mean, since Peter's not really here

1666
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:18,030
不能讲出他的事实
to tell his truth,

1667
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,820
那你的事实呢  布拉德
what about you, Brad?

1668
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:22,160
你为什么觉得你可以拍人上厕所的照片
Why do you think it's cool to take pictures of people in the bathroom?

1669
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,940
是啊  哥们  那怎么回事
Yeah, dude, what's that about?

1670
01:30:24,130 --> 01:30:26,090
不不  不是那样的
No, no, no, it wasn't like that. It was...

1671
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:27,550
我是想...
I was trying to take a...

1672
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:29,820
我们忘记这一切的疯狂吧
Let's just put all this craziness behind us

1673
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:33,000
度过一个美好平和的下午

1674
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:36,470
"好啊  哈林顿老师"同学们说  好

我现在要做个酷老师
I'm gonna be a cool teacher right now.

1676
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:42,520
你别再那么做了  是很奇怪
You gotta stop doing that. Okay? It is weird.

1677
01:30:42,810 --> 01:30:44,160
再不许在厕所里拍照了
No more photos in the bathroom.

1678
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:46,450
不管是小便池还是隔间
Urinal or stalls.

1679
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:47,350
-好吗  -看啊
- Okay? - Look at this.

1680
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:49,550

01:31:06,310 --> 01:31:08,920
我把周边扫了一遍  没有发现
I did a full perimeter sweep. Nothing.

1689
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:10,800
该死
Damn it.

1690
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:14,460
脉冲在激增
Pulse is spiking.

1691

你一看到什么  马上报告
Soon as you see something, report.

1693
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:19,630
我们只剩你了  贝克
You're all we've got, Beck.

1694
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:21,560
如果这是我担心的那样
If this is what I fear,

1695
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:22,940
那上帝保佑我们了  弗瑞
then God help us, Fury.

1696
01:31:24,170 --> 01:31:25,220
上帝保佑我们所有人

把褶子都熨平了

1706
01:31:53,410 --> 01:31:55,610
它比之前的强100倍
it's 100 times bigger than the previous ones.

1707
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:56,420
伊迪丝

01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:14,580
我不喜欢这情况  绝对有问题
I don't like this. Something's definitely up.

1716
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:18,650
你现在是蛛友了  "蜘蛛侠的朋友"
You're an FOS now. "Friend of Spider-Man."

1717
01:32:18,690 --> 01:32:21,180
你得记住  保持冷静
And you have to remember, just stay calm.

1718
01:32:25,350 --> 01:32:26,580
内德  那看上去不妙
Ned, that doesn't look good.

1719
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:29,230
但那是假的  所以不必担心
But it's fake, so, there's nothing to worry about.

1720
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:32,290
孩子们进入击杀区了
And the kids are in the kill zone.

1721
01:32:33,230 --> 01:32:34,480
干得好  古特曼

I know. What do you want?

1724
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,550
斯塔克先生那边在整理东西
Over at Mr. Stark's, going through his belongings.

1725
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:44,870
你似乎留下了一块冲浪板
Apparently there was a surfboard you left behind.

1726
01:32:44,870 --> 01:32:46,130
-什么  -那边的人说
- What? - People over there said

1727
01:32:46,130 --> 01:32:47,550
尼克·弗瑞不像冲浪的人
they didn't think Nick Fury was a surfer,

1728
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:48,740
但我说"人不可貌相"
but I said, "Appearances can be deceiving."

1729
01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:51,950
不是我的  永远别再打这个号码了
It's not mine. And don't ever call this number again.

1730
01:33:00,570 --> 01:33:02,710
好  弗瑞听懂暗语了
Okay. Fury's got the coded message.

1731
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:04,940
-你的朋友在塔桥上  -好
- Your friends are at the Tower Bridge. - Okay.

1732
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:06,900
你朋友说是伦敦桥  但我还是猜出来了
Your boy called it London Bridge, but I figured it out.

1733
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,350
-我去接他们  好吗  -好
- I'm gonna go scoop them up, okay? - Yeah.

1734
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:10,410

1736

1737
01:33:12,990 --> 01:33:15,820
你走之前  如果我出事了
Before you go, if something happens to me,

1738
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:17,470
你可以把这个给MJ吗
could you please give this to MJ?

1739
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:20,010
你能安全回来的  到时你自己给她
You are gonna make it back. You'll give it to her yourself.

1740
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:21,390
-你行的  -我行的
- Okay? You got this. - I got this.

1741
01:33:21,390 --> 01:33:24,320
-跟我说一遍  -他们用的是幻景科技
- Walk me through it. - I know it's illusion tech, right?

1742
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,360
我只需要进入幻景内部
All I do is get on the inside of the illusion,

1743
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:27,410
我就能击垮它
then I can take it down,

1744
01:33:27,410 --> 01:33:28,970
找到他  而他只是个人
find him, and he's just a guy.

1745
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:30,510
我可以把伊迪丝夺回来
So, I can take EDITH right back.

1746
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:32,830
好  但上次  你被火车撞了
Right, but last time, you got hit by a train.

1747
01:33:33,330 --> 01:33:35,600
是的  但这次
True, but this time...

1748
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,040
我怎么解释呢
How do I explain this?

1749
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:39,220
我有种第六感
I have a sixth sense.

1750
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:40,370
彼得一激灵
The Peter-tingle.

1751
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:42,740
你是说那个吧
That's what you're talking about, right?

1752
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:43,900
但现在不灵了
It's not working, though.

1753
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:46,000
我听说现在不灵了  是吧
I heard it wasn't working right now. Is it?

1754
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:46,780
灵的
It is working.

1755
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:48,260
-我不知道灵不灵...  -好

我去接你的朋友
I'm gonna go get your friends.

1758
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:53,410
你让你的彼得一激灵重新上线
You get that Peter-tingle back online.

1759
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,530
我行的
I got this. I got this.

1760
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:10,790
闪电开始
Cue the lightning.

1761
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,260
闪电开始
Cuing lightning.

1762
01:34:17,730 --> 01:34:19,520
先生  上面还安全吗
Sir, is it still safe on the top,

1763
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,910
还是我们该下来
or should we all come down?

1764
01:34:21,970 --> 01:34:22,650
天啊
Oh, my.

1765
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:26,050

大巴司机不见了
Bus driver's gone.

1767
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,200
-什么  -去哪了
- What? - Where?

1768
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:32,020
没事的  戴尔老师和我能控制局面
It's okay. Mr. Dell and I have it under control!

1769
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:33,950
不  别把我拉进来
No. Don't drag me into this.

1770
01:34:33,950 --> 01:34:35,820
我已经尽力了  朱利亚斯
I'm doing my best, Julius!

1771

-听着  -又是巫术

1772
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:40,890
天啊  快下车

Come on, let's go!

1775
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:08,410
这才是复仇者级别的威胁呢
Now, that is an Avengers-level threat.

1776
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,560
这边走
This way. This way!

1777
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:28,490

This way. Follow me.

1780
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:33,520
这都不是真的
It's not real, it's not real!

1781
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,160
我看可挺真的
Well, it looks pretty real to me!

跟我来  孩子们
Follow me, kids!

1783
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:39,880
地  风  火  水  不
Earth, wind, fire, water. Oh, no.

1784
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,920
他们合体了  就像超能战士
They joined forces like the Power Rangers.

1785
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:43,840
-那是战神金刚  -什么
- You're thinking of Voltron. - Who?

1786
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,710
你想的是战神金刚
Voltron! You're thinking of Voltron!

1787
01:35:45,790 --> 01:35:47,390
看  是神秘客
Hey, look, it's Mysterio!

1788
01:35:47,390 --> 01:35:48,660
他会救我们的
He's gonna save us!

1789
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:53,870
等等  如果神秘客知道我们知道了
Wait, if Mysterio knows we know...

1790
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:56,180
-我们就危险了  -对  他们也是
- Then we're in danger. - Yeah, and so are they.

1791
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:57,010
我们走吧
We should go.

1792
01:35:58,930 --> 01:36:00,440
灭了那巫术
Kill that witch! Ba-bow!

1793
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:04,510
这是为了我家人
This is for my family!

1794
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:07,660
你该去安全的地方  弗瑞
You should get somewhere safe, Fury.

1795
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:09,650
我觉得这事不会有好结局的
I don't see this ending well.

1796
01:36:09,650 --> 01:36:11,280
多谢你关心
I appreciate your concern,

1797
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:13,990
但我绝不会丢下战友
but I never leave my men behind.

1798
01:36:15,390 --> 01:36:17,340
好  通讯检查  听到吗  孩子
All right, comms check. Can you hear me, kid?

1799
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:19,330
能听到  就是外面有点吵
Yeah. I can. It's a little loud out here.

1800
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:21,100
-新战衣不错  -谢谢
- I like the new suit. - Thanks.

1801

01:49:49,230 --> 01:49:51,270
他好像是为你工作
I think he's like, works for you or something.

1954
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:52,500
他...
He, um...

1955

He gave me this.

1956

and give it to you in Paris at the top...

1961
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,640
你吻了我
And you kissed me.

1962
01:50:10,850 --> 01:50:12,670
-什么  -是啊

1963
01:50:13,630 --> 01:50:15,460
我在跟人亲近上
I don't really have much luck

1964
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:17,730
不怎么走运
when it comes to getting close to people.

1965
01:50:20,150 --> 01:50:20,970
所以我撒谎了
So I lied.

1966
01:50:23,270 --> 01:50:24,610
我看你
I wasn't just watching you

1967
01:50:24,610 --> 01:50:27,220
不仅仅是因为我猜到你是蜘蛛侠
because I thought you were Spider-Man.

1968
01:50:31,790 --> 01:50:32,720
太好了
That's great.

1969
01:50:34,690 --> 01:50:37,200
-黑色大丽花  就像拿起谋杀案  -谋杀案
- Black dahlia, like the murder. - The murder.

1970
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:37,910
-好  -是啊
- Good. - Yeah.

1971
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:40,750
抱歉都坏了
Sorry it's broken.

1972
01:50:41,330 --> 01:50:43,170
我更喜欢坏掉的
I actually like it better broken.

1973
01:50:45,170 --> 01:50:46,370
我真的好喜欢你
I really like you.

1974
01:50:48,010 --> 01:50:49,160
我也真的好喜欢你
I really like you too.

1975
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:05,460
好  那我...
Okay. I should...

1976
01:51:05,530 --> 01:51:08,660
我回去找同学们了
I should probably get back to the class.

1977
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:09,440
我去...
I'll go and...

1978
01:51:11,490 --> 01:51:13,140
-嗯  我也不知道  -好吧
- Yeah. Heh. I don't know. - Heh. Okay.

1979
01:51:15,030 --> 01:51:15,900
以防万一
Just in case.

1980
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:25,170
不
Yeah, no.

1981
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:26,500
不  梅  你是对的

1982
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:28,460
他干得很棒  他很坚强

1984
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:32,270
我得挂了
I gotta go.

1985
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,200
很高兴你还活着
Well, I'm glad you're alive.

1986
01:51:35,490 --> 01:51:36,920
看来那句暗语起作用了
I guess the coded message worked.

1987
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:39,000
"人不可貌相"
"Appearances can be deceiving."

1988
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:42,280
你怎么不直接冲镜头眨眼
I'm surprised you didn't just wink in the camera.

1989
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:44,890
-你不是懂了  -那也是因为我一开始
- It worked. - Only because I had serious doubts

1990
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:46,080
就对贝克持有很深的怀疑
about Beck from the beginning.

1991
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:47,770
才不是  他完全信了
Not true. He had zero doubts.

1992
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:52,350
帕克呢
Where's Parker?

1993
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:53,680
他跟个姑娘在一起呢
He's with a girl.

1994
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:56,100
我需要跟他谈谈
I need to speak with him.

1995
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:57,880
他会联系你的
He'll call you.

1996
01:51:58,360 --> 01:51:59,050
他...
He'll...?

1997
01:52:03,370 --> 01:52:05,350
好啊  好
Okay. Great.

1998
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:06,700
他最好联系我
Well, he better.

1999
01:52:07,330 --> 01:52:08,730
否则我拿你是问
Or it's your ass.

2000
01:52:09,950 --> 01:52:12,740
你可别想跟我玩消失
And don't even think about ghosting me.

2001
01:52:30,260 --> 01:52:31,960
你确定没有别人发现吗
Are you sure no one else has figured it out?

2002
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,110
确定  反正也没别人注意你
Yeah, I mean, it's not like anybody really pays attention to you.

2003
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:36,910
扎心
Ouch.

2004
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:38,620
除了我
Except for me.

2005
01:52:39,390 --> 01:52:40,100

01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:51,290
比如说  一起去四人约会什么的
I don't know, like go on a double date or something.

2011
01:52:51,990 --> 01:52:53,430
我们分手了
We broke up.

2012
01:52:53,490 --> 01:52:55,200
不  怎么了  为什么
No. What? Why?

2013
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:57,060
男人和女人会渐渐疏远
Men and women grow apart,

2014
01:52:57,630 --> 01:52:59,310
但他们所共同经历的旅程
but the journey they share together

2015
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:00,890
将永远成为他们的一部分

2038
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:04,690
不管发展到什么方向

-分分合合  -并把它分享给...

I mean, this is just embarrassing for a shape-shifter. Fine.

2103
02:07:56,850 --> 02:07:59,410
你好  希望你的任务还顺利
Hey there. I hope your mission is going well.

2104
02:07:59,410 --> 02:08:03,080
我们一周前照你说的把眼镜给了帕克
We gave the glasses to Parker about a week ago, like you said.

2105
02:08:03,090 --> 02:08:06,700
场面很感人的
And it was very touching, you know?

2106
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:08,500
真的很感人
Really, really quite touching.

2107
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:09,490
塔罗斯
Talos.

2108
02:08:09,950 --> 02:08:13,520
在之后不久
And, you know, shortly after that,

2109
02:08:14,490 --> 02:08:16,090
一切都失控了
it really kind of went off the rails,

2110
02:08:16,090 --> 02:08:17,400
我们需要你回来
so we need you to come back.

2111
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:19,590
因为大家都在问复仇者联盟在哪
Cause, everyone kept asking where the Avengers are,

2112
02:08:19,590 --> 02:08:20,900
我又不知道该怎么回答
I don't know what to say to that,

2113
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:22,780
幸好蜘蛛侠赢...
so you're lucky that Spider-Man won...

2114
02:08:45,530 --> 02:08:46,910
都回去工作
Everybody back to work!

2115
02:08:54,750 --> 02:08:56,340
我的鞋谁拿了
Who's got my shoes?
