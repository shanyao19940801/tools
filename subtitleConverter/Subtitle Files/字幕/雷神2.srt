{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我要和犯人单独谈一谈
I will speak to the prisoner alone.

129
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,800
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我真不知道你们这是演的哪一出
I really don't see what all the fuss is about.

130
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}难道你真的不知道自己罪孽深重吗
Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes?

131
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,090
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你在哪儿 哪儿就有战争 毁灭和死亡
Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death.

132
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,730
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我作为仁慈的神 去中土世界
I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth

133
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,410
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}统治地球的子民
as a benevolent god,

134
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,910
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}就像你一样

135
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,980
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我们并不是神
We are not gods.

136

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我们也有生老病死 和人类一样
We are born, we live, we die, just as humans do.

137
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,460
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}但我们有五千年的寿命
Give or take five thousand years.

138
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,130
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}今天这一切都源于洛基对王位的追求
All this because Loki desires a throne.

139
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,520
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}那是我应有的权力
It's my birthright!

140
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,780
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你的权力
Your birthright

141

142
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,740
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}是幼年夭折
as a child!

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,350
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}被丢弃在冰冷的岩石上
Cast out onto a frozen rock.

144
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,240
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}如果我没有收留你
If I had not taken you in

145
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,590
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你就不会像现在这样恨我了
you would not be here now to hate me.

146
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,800
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}如果我不该活着的话 那就请你慈悲为怀
If I am for the axe, then for mercy's sake,

147
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,830
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}赐我一死
just swing it.

148
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,700
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我并非不喜欢这次谈话
It's not that I don't love our little talks,

149
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,920
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我只是
it's just...

150
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,920
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我的确不喜欢
I don't love them.

151
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,950
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}如果不是弗丽嘉你早就一命呜呼了
Frigga is the only reason you are still alive

152
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,520
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你再也见不到她
and you will never see her again.

153
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,340
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我要让你一辈子待在地牢里
You will spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.

154
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,700
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}那么索尔呢
And what of Thor?

155
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,980
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你要让那个白痴去当国王 让我把牢底坐穿
You'll make that witless oaf king while I rot in chains?

156
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,940
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}索尔必须去收拾你留下的烂摊子
Thor must strive to undo the damage you have done,

157
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,270
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}他得让九大国度恢复秩序
he will bring order to the nine Realms and then,

158
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,440
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}是的 他会是国王
yes, he will be king.

159
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,510
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}其实我已经完全掌握局势了
I've got this completely under control!

160
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,180
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}难怪这儿如此热闹
Is that why everything's on fire!

161
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,560
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}不用客气
You're welcome.

162
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,020
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}看你的了
All yours.

163
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,550
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你好

00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,270
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我接受你的投降

165
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,030
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}还有人吗
Anyone else?

166
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,010
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}看来下次我们得先拿个大的开刀
Perhaps next time we should start with the big one.

167
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,300
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我们接下来干什么
Where do we go next?

168
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,770
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}九大国度即将迎来和平
Hogun, the peace is nearly won across the Nine Realms.

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:11,730
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你应该留下
You should stay here

170
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,590
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}和你的人民在一起
be with your people where your heart is,

171
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,090
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}暂时不回阿萨
Asgard can wait.

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}真是太谢谢你了

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,220
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}海姆达尔 可以了吗
Heimdall, when you're ready.

175
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,900
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}瓦纳海姆安全了吗
Is Vanaheim secure?

176
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,410
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}不亚于诺恩海姆和瑞亚
As are Nornheim and Ria.

177
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,960
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}您要是御驾亲征 会更早结束
Though our work would have gone more quickly with you at the fore.

178
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,770
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}看来你把我当成马屁股了
You must think I'm a piece of bread

179
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,960
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}最近没事就想拍一拍
that needs to be buttered so heavily.

180
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,740
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我可没那个意思
That was not my intent.

181
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,790
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}自从彩虹桥遭到破坏以来
For the first time since Bifrost was destroyed,

182
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,390
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}九大国度首次回归和平
the Nine Realms are at peace.

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,110
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}他们会记住我们的强大
They're well reminded of our strength

184

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}谢谢
Thank you.

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}一切都恢复了秩序 除了你那无法平静的内心
Nothing out of order except your confused and distracted heart.

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}这跟简·福斯特无关 父王
This isn't about Jane Foster, father.

Human lives are fleeting, they're nothing.

189
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,010
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你应该珍惜自己的大好前程
You'd be better served by what lies in front of you.

190
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,240
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我并非以众神之父的身份和你说话
I'm telling you this not as the All-father,

191
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,720
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我是你父亲
but as your father.

192
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,670
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你长大了 到了接掌王位的时候了
You are ready, the time has come for you to take the throne.

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}去享受和庆祝你的胜利
Embrace and celebrate what you've won.

194
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,140
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}到将士们中间
Join your warriors,

195
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,280
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}开怀畅饮 跟他们彻夜狂欢
eat and drink, revel in their celebration.

196
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,100

At least pretend to enjoy yourself.

197
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,500
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}再来一杯
Another.

198
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,280
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}有些狂欢至少应该持续几个星期
There was a time when you would celebrate for weeks.

199
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,950
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我记得你曾醉心于庆祝哈罗金战役
I remember you celebrated the Battle of Harokin

200
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,960
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}以至于你差点又去打第二次
so much that you nearly started the second.

201
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,030
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}是啊 第一次那么开心
Well, the first was so much fun.

00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,000
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}陪我喝一杯
Take a drink with me.

203
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,530
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你父王今晚不会再给你安排新任务了吧
Surely the All-father could have no further task for you tonight.

204
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,580
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}可是 我给自己安排了任务
No, this is one I set myself.

205
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,480
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我不是不知道你每晚都在玩消失
It does not go unnoticed that you disappear each night.

206
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,820
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我们有九大国度
There are Nine Realms,

207
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,470
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}未来的国王可不能只盯着其中一个
the future king of Asgard must focus on more than one.

208

So what's the story with you?

212
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,680
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}为什么要有心事 我没心事
Why does there have to be a story, there's no story.

213
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,910
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}要知道 自从我们见面以后
You spent the first ten minutes of our date

214
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,650
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你一直在研究菜谱 可那上面只有三种选择
hiding behind a menu that has three choices on it.

215

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}无非是鸡肉 蔬菜和鱼
It's either chicken, vegetarian or fish, Jane.

216
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,430
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}所以我认为你有心事
I think there's a story

217
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,330
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}而且一定是和某个男人有关系
and I'm thinking the story involves a guy?

218
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,330
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}这可说来话长了
It's complicated.

00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,690
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}他还在这儿吗
Is he still around?

220
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,180
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}不 他

221
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,300
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}他离开了

222
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,330
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我能理解
I've been there.

223
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,260
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}分手是非常痛苦的 对吗
The going away. It's hard, isn't it?

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我曾经追过一个女孩 后来她去了纽约工作
I was seeing a woman and uh...she took a job in New York,

225
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,040
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我们还是输给了距离
eventually the distance killed it.

226
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,740
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}其实 其实她
And...and the fact that she uh...

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}她一直和其他男人上床
she kept sleeping with other dudes.

228

Hi. Um...could we get some wine please?

Sure, I'd love some.

Richard, this is Darcy.

232
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,420
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你来干什么

fully expecting you to be moping around in your pajamas

236
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,150
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}一边吃冰淇淋 一边想念 那个人
eating ice cream obsessing about... you know who...

237
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,430
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}可是你没有 你穿了淑女装
But you're not! You're wearing lady clothes,

you even showered, didn't you? You smell good.

239
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,370
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你到底有什么事
Is there a point to all this,

240
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,510
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我说你总不会平白无故地来找我吧
because there really needs to be a point to all this.

241
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,060
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}对
Right.

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}记得那些你已经失去兴趣的科学仪器吗
You know all that scientific equipment you don't look at anymore?

243
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,190
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}也许你应该再看上一眼

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}他怎么取胜的

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}他消灭了他们

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}还有索尔
Does Thor?

514

00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,230
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我只不过是揭穿了那个
I was merely giving truth to the lie

518
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,120
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}欺骗了我一生的谎言而已
that I've been fed my entire life,

When Heimdall had lost sight of you, you were no longer on Earth.

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}那怎么可能呢
Well, how's that possible?

The Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil,

534
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:46,080
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}它们围绕中庭旋转 犹如地球围绕太阳
orbiting Midgard in much the way your planet orbits the sun.

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}每过五千年 它们就会呈直线排列
And every five thousand years the worlds align perfectly,

536
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,450
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我们称之为天体聚合
and we call this the Convergence.

537
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,250
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}在这段时间 各国边界会出现混淆
During this time the boarders between worlds become blurred.

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}可能你已经发现了一些端倪
It's possible you found one of these points.

We are lucky that it remained open.

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}天体聚合过后 直列现象结束
Once the worlds pass out of alignment,

541
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,210
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}混淆情况就会消失
the connection is lost.

My father doesn't know everything.

It is as if they resented being imprisoned.

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,010
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}有些家伙就是不识好歹
There's no pleasing some creatures.

Look, why don't you let me take over,

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}是吗
How?

966
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:55,920
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}用什么方式
Jane, how?

967
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:59,380
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我在地球上见到他了 他为什么要去地球
I saw him on Earth. Why would he go to Earth?

968
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:01,110
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}因为天体聚合
The Convergence.

969
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,530
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}噢 上帝
Oh, God.

970
01:22:02,530 --> 01:22:05,180
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}如果我没发现以太粒子 一切都不会发生
None of this would have happened if I hadn't found the Aether.

971
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:08,910
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}那也只能延缓玛勒基斯得到以太粒子的时间
Then Malekith would've only possess that much sooner.

972
01:22:09,410 --> 01:22:11,700
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我是因为找你才发现它的
I only found it because I was looking for you.

973
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:13,640
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}简
Jane.

974
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:17,070
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}结果我们被困在这儿
Now we're trapped here.

975
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,090
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}跟我没关系
It's not me.

976
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:26,860
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}喂
Hello?

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}理查德 你在哪儿
Richard? Where are you?

979
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:34,000
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我在办公室呢 今天我真是忙得快要疯掉了
I'm still at the office, it's...it's been a crazy day here today.

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}天呐  太不可思议了
Oh, my God, this is amazing.

01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:39,680
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}尽管 尽管我们什么也没吃
Despite never actually ordering anything.

983
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:41,390
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}这里怎么会有信号
How am I getting service here?

984
01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:43,360
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你是不是不方便 要不过会儿打给你吧
Is it a bad time? Do you want me to try later?

985
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,420
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}不不不 求你了 你做什么都行
No, no, no... please, whatever you do,

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}那好吧
Okay then.

988
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,980
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我想知道我们能否再试试
I was just wondering if you want to try again.

989

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}呃 我们一起吃晚饭吧
Uh, maybe dinner next time.

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}噢 上帝啊
Oh, my God.

994
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:03,860
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我是不是影响到你了
Am I interrupting something?

995
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:05,560
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}不 不 没影响
No, no... nothing at all.

999
01:23:10,730 --> 01:23:12,450
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}这儿为什么有这么多鞋
Why are there so many shoes in here?

1000
01:23:14,150 --> 01:23:15,510
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我给她发短信
I'll just text her.

1001

So who's Richard?

1014
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:03,330
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}包括你在重力异常方面的研究
all the work you've been doing on gravimetric anomalies,

1015
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:04,530
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}- 所有研究 - 好的
- everything. - Okay.

Are you well, Erik?

01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,500
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你兄弟没一起来吗
Your brother's not coming, is he?

1018
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:11,530
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}洛基他死了
Loki is dead.

1019
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:12,890
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

1022
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:42,870
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}对不起 陛下
Forgive me, my liege.

1023
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:46,430
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我带回了黑暗世界的消息
I've returned from the Dark World with news.

1024
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:50,300
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}索尔
Thor?

1025
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:52,450
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}并没有找到索尔
There was no sign of Thor.

1026
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:54,580
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}那件武器也是 可
Or the weapon, but...

1027
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,090
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}什么
What?

1028
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,460
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}发现了一具尸体
We found a body.

1029
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:08,620
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}洛基
Loki.

1030
01:25:12,670 --> 01:25:14,260
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}玛勒基斯会向九大国度
Malekith is going to fire the Aether

1031
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:16,790
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}相连的某个点释放以太粒子
at the spot where all the nine worlds are connecting.

1032
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:19,010
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}那样会使杀伤力成倍增加
Amplifying the weapon's impact.

1033
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:23,170
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}每增加一个国度 其能量会成指数增长
For each additional world, the power will increase exponentially.

1034
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:25,690
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}它将危及到整个宇宙
The effect would be universal.

1035
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:27,810
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}是的 可聚合是暂时的
Yes, but the Alignment is only temperory,

1036
01:25:27,810 --> 01:25:30,710
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}他必须在正确的时间 处在正确的地点
he must be in exactly the right place at the right time.

1037
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:32,400
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}怎么知道正确的地点
Well, how do we know where that is?

1038
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:35,470
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}可以从一些线索下手
We follow the directions.

1039
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:39,030
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}那种事发生过 在数千年前
This has happened before, thousands of years ago.

1040
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:40,920
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}古人曾经到过事发现场
And the Ancients were there to see it.

1041
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:43,730
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}所有那些伟大的建筑
All the great constructions,

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}玛雅人 中国人 埃及人
the Mayans, the Chinese, the Egyptians.

1043
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,630
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}他们都对天体聚合的重力影响进行过利用
They made use of the gravitational affects of the Convergence.

1044
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:52,030
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}而且留下了地图
And they left us a map.

1045
01:25:52,670 --> 01:25:53,820
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}巨石阵
Stonehenge.

1046
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:57,710
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}斯诺登峰 大奥姆山
Snowdon. Great Orme.

1047
01:25:57,710 --> 01:26:00,010
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}这些都可以成为坐标
These are all coordinates. Taking us...

1048
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:02,580
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}这儿
here.

1049
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,930
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}格林威治
Greenwich.

1050
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:08,950
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}各国度之间的边界几乎会完全消失
The walls between worlds will almost non-existing,

1051
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:10,450
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}物理法则彻底崩溃
physics is gonna go ballistic.

1052
01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:12,290
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}重力变得忽高忽低
Increases and decreases of gravity,

1053
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:13,740
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}空间受到挤压
spacial extrusions,

1054
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:16,560
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}现实中所有的一切都将分崩离析
the very fabric of reality is gonna be torn apart.

1055
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:21,050
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我最好穿上裤子
I better get my pants.

1056
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,120
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}当心点 事关重大
Focus, this is important.

1057
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,750
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我们要把它们布满整个广场
We had to hammer them in all around the site,

1058
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:29,060
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}然后简和艾瑞克在钟楼上启动它们
and then Jane and Erik will activate them from the tower.

1059
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:30,490
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}它们是捆住的
They're taped together.

1060
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,140
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你知不知道它们是干什么用的
Do you even know what these things do?

1061
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:35,210
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}不
No.

1062
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,000
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我也是
Neither do I.

You needn't have come so far Asgardian.

1067

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}因为死神很快就要去拜访你了
Death would've come to you soon enough.

1068
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:27,150
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我不会死在你手里
Not by your hand.

1069
01:28:27,150 --> 01:28:30,300
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你的宇宙根本就不应该存在
Your universe was never meant to be.

1070

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你的国度 和你的家庭 都将被彻底清除
Your world, and your family will be extinguished.

1071
01:28:37,610 --> 01:28:39,000
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我们没时间了
We're running out of time.

1072
01:28:39,010 --> 01:28:40,100
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}快好了
Almost there.

1073
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:41,750
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}这种事能行得通吗
You sure this is gonna work.

1074
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:44,770
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}那些设备是用来检测异常的 不是产生异常
These devices were made to detect anomalies, not causing them.

1075
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:46,360
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}快点
Come on.

1076

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}快点 达茜
Come on, Darcy.

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}我以为有了那件武器
You know, with all that power,

1078
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:07,580
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}你出手会更狠一点
I thought you'd hit harder.

1079
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:33,650
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}搞定
Done.

1080

{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}天体聚合将在7分钟内达到峰值
The Convergences will be in full effect in 7 minutes.

1081
01:29:43,450 --> 01:29:46,020
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}看来我们还得跟玛勒基斯纠缠8分钟
That just means we have to keep Malekith busy for 8.

1082
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:54,830
{\pos(98,255)\fscx50}好了 你最好抓住什么东西
Okay, you might want to hold on to something.

1083

Please, don't make this worse.

I will speak to the prisoner alone.

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我真不知道你们这是演的哪一出
I really don't see what all the fuss is about.

1332
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}难道你真的不知道自己罪孽深重吗
Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes?

1333

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}你在哪儿 哪儿就有战争 毁灭和死亡
Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death.

00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,910
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}就像你一样

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,980
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我们并不是神
We are not gods.

Give or take five thousand years.

1340
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,130
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}今天这一切都源于洛基对王位的追求
All this because Loki desires a throne.

1341
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,520
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}那是我应有的权力
It's my birthright!

1344
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,740
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}是幼年夭折
as a child!

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}被丢弃在冰冷的岩石上
Cast out onto a frozen rock.

1346
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,240
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}如果我没有收留你
If I had not taken you in

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}你就不会像现在这样恨我了
you would not be here now to hate me.

1348
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,800
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}如果我不该活着的话 那就请你慈悲为怀
If I am for the axe, then for mercy's sake,

1349
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,830
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}赐我一死
just swing it.

1350
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,700
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我并非不喜欢这次谈话
It's not that I don't love our little talks,

1351
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,920
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我只是
it's just...

1352
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,920
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我的确不喜欢
I don't love them.

1353
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,950
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}如果不是弗丽嘉你早就一命呜呼了
Frigga is the only reason you are still alive

1354
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,520
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}你再也见不到她
and you will never see her again.

1355
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,340
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我要让你一辈子待在地牢里
You will spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.

1356
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,700
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}那么索尔呢
And what of Thor?

1357
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,980
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}你要让那个白痴去当国王 让我把牢底坐穿
You'll make that witless oaf king while I rot in chains?

1358
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,940
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}索尔必须去收拾你留下的烂摊子
Thor must strive to undo the damage you have done,

1359
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,270
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}他得让九大国度恢复秩序
he will bring order to the nine Realms and then,

1360
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,440
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}是的 他会是国王
yes, he will be king.

1361
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,510
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}其实我已经完全掌握局势了
I've got this completely under control!

1362
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,180
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}难怪这儿如此热闹
Is that why everything's on fire!

1363
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,560
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}不用客气
You're welcome.

1364
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,020
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}看你的了
All yours.

1365
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,550
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}你好

1367
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,030
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}还有人吗
Anyone else?

1368
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,010
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}看来下次我们得先拿个大的开刀
Perhaps next time we should start with the big one.

1369
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,300
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我们接下来干什么
Where do we go next?

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}九大国度即将迎来和平
Hogun, the peace is nearly won across the Nine Realms.

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:11,730
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}你应该留下
You should stay here

1372
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,590
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}和你的人民在一起
be with your people where your heart is,

1373
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,090
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}暂时不回阿萨
Asgard can wait.

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我也要谢谢你
As you have mine.

1376
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,220
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}海姆达尔 可以了吗
Heimdall, when you're ready.

1377
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,900
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}瓦纳海姆安全了吗
Is Vanaheim secure?

1378
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,410
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}不亚于诺恩海姆和瑞亚
As are Nornheim and Ria.

1379
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,960
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}您要是御驾亲征 会更早结束
Though our work would have gone more quickly with you at the fore.

1380
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,770
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}看来你把我当成马屁股了
You must think I'm a piece of bread

1381
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,960
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}最近没事就想拍一拍
that needs to be buttered so heavily.

1382
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,740
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我可没那个意思
That was not my intent.

1383
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,790
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}自从彩虹桥遭到破坏以来
For the first time since Bifrost was destroyed,

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,390
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}九大国度首次回归和平
the Nine Realms are at peace.

They're well reminded of our strength

1386

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}谢谢
Thank you.

1388

Nothing out of order except your confused and distracted heart.

This isn't about Jane Foster, father.

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}人类的生命转瞬即逝
Human lives are fleeting, they're nothing.

1391
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,010
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}你应该珍惜自己的大好前程
You'd be better served by what lies in front of you.

1392
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,240
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我并非以众神之父的身份和你说话
I'm telling you this not as the All-father,

1393
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,720
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我是你父亲
but as your father.

1394
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,670
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}你长大了 到了接掌王位的时候了
You are ready, the time has come for you to take the throne.

1395
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,520
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}去享受和庆祝你的胜利
Embrace and celebrate what you've won.

Join your warriors,

1397

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}开怀畅饮 跟他们彻夜狂欢
eat and drink, revel in their celebration.

1398
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,100
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}至少也该做做样子吧
At least pretend to enjoy yourself.

1399
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,500
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}再来一杯
Another.

1400
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,280
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}有些狂欢至少应该持续几个星期
There was a time when you would celebrate for weeks.

1401
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,950
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我记得你曾醉心于庆祝哈罗金战役
I remember you celebrated the Battle of Harokin

1402
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,960
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}以至于你差点又去打第二次
so much that you nearly started the second.

1403
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,030
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}是啊 第一次那么开心
Well, the first was so much fun.

00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,000
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}陪我喝一杯
Take a drink with me.

1405
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,530
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}你父王今晚不会再给你安排新任务了吧
Surely the All-father could have no further task for you tonight.

1406
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,580
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}可是 我给自己安排了任务
No, this is one I set myself.

1407
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,480
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我不是不知道你每晚都在玩消失
It does not go unnoticed that you disappear each night.

1408
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,820
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我们有九大国度
There are Nine Realms,

1409
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,470
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}未来的国王可不能只盯着其中一个
the future king of Asgard must focus on more than one.

1410

So what's the story with you?

1414
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,680
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}为什么要有心事 我没心事
Why does there have to be a story, there's no story.

1415
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,910
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}要知道 自从我们见面以后
You spent the first ten minutes of our date

1416
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,650
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}你一直在研究菜谱 可那上面只有三种选择
hiding behind a menu that has three choices on it.

1417

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}无非是鸡肉 蔬菜和鱼
It's either chicken, vegetarian or fish, Jane.

1418
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,430
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}所以我认为你有心事
I think there's a story

1419
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,330
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}而且一定是和某个男人有关系
and I'm thinking the story involves a guy?

1420
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,330
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}这可说来话长了
It's complicated.

1421
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,690
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}他还在这儿吗
Is he still around?

1422
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,180
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}不 他

1423
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,300
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}他离开了

1424
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,330
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我能理解
I've been there.

1425
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,260
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}分手是非常痛苦的 对吗
The going away. It's hard, isn't it?

1426
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,920
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我曾经追过一个女孩 后来她去了纽约工作
I was seeing a woman and uh...she took a job in New York,

1427
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,040
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我们还是输给了距离
eventually the distance killed it.

1428
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,740
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}其实 其实她
And...and the fact that she uh...

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,740
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}她一直和其他男人上床
she kept sleeping with other dudes.

1430
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,280
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}- 不 - 哦 无数人
- No! - Oh, so many.

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}嗨 呃 能给我们来点红酒吗
Hi. Um...could we get some wine please?

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}当然 我也想喝
Sure, I'd love some.

1433

Richard, this is Darcy.

1434
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,420
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}你来干什么
What are you doing here?

So, I show up to work at the lab/your mom's house,

1437
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,820

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我只不过是揭穿了那个
I was merely giving truth to the lie

1720
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,120
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}欺骗了我一生的谎言而已

00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,810
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}说什么我生而为王

orbiting Midgard in much the way your planet orbits the sun.

1737

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}每过五千年 它们就会呈直线排列
And every five thousand years the worlds align perfectly,

00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,450
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}我们称之为天体聚合
and we call this the Convergence.

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}在这段时间 各国边界会出现混淆
During this time the boarders between worlds become blurred.

It's possible you found one of these points.

We are lucky that it remained open.

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}天体聚合过后 直列现象结束
Once the worlds pass out of alignment,

1743
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,210
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}混淆情况就会消失
the connection is lost.

My father doesn't know everything.

It is as if they resented being imprisoned.

1761
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,010

There's no pleasing some creatures.

1762

I did not come here to share our grief.

that my brother was still in there somewhere.

1929

This is so unlike you, brother.

1935
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,540
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}秘密的行动
So clandestine.

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}你真的不想用武力来解决问题吗
Are you sure you wouldn't rather just punch your way out.

Still, we could be less conspicuous.

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}玛勒基斯会向九大国度
Malekith is going to fire the Aether

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}相连的某个点释放以太粒子
at the spot where all the nine worlds are connecting.

2234
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:19,010
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}那样会使杀伤力成倍增加
Amplifying the weapon's impact.

2235

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}每增加一个国度 其能量会成指数增长
For each additional world, the power will increase exponentially.

2236
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:25,690
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}它将危及到整个宇宙
The effect would be universal.

2237
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:27,810

Yes, but the Alignment is only temperory,

2238

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}怎么知道正确的地点
Well, how do we know where that is?

2240
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:35,470
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}可以从一些线索下手
We follow the directions.

2245

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}他们都对天体聚合的重力影响进行过利用
They made use of the gravitational affects of the Convergence.

2246
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:52,030
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}而且留下了地图
And they left us a map.

2247
01:25:52,670 --> 01:25:53,820
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}巨石阵

These are all coordinates. Taking us...

2250

{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}格林威治
Greenwich.

2252
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:08,950
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}各国度之间的边界几乎会完全消失
The walls between worlds will almost non-existing,

2253
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:10,450
{\pos(286,255)\fscx50}物理法则彻底崩溃
physics is gonna go ballistic.
