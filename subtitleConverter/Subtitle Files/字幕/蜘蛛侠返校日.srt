It's my suit.

165
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,210
-箱子呢  -什么箱子
- Where's the case? - What case?

166
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,220
那不是我的...什么  我以为那是个橱柜
That's not my... What? I thought that was a closet.

167
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,510
-这里也是我的房间吗  -快去吧
- This is still my room? - Go. Please.

168
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,140
-我的房间好大...  -快去
- My room is way bigger than-- - There.

169
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,540
我找到箱子了  我找到箱子了
I found the case. I found the case. I found the case.

170
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,200
"稍作升级"
"A minor upgrade"?

171
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,500
天呐
Oh, my god.

172
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,680
-穿上  -什么
- Put it on. - What the--?

173
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,610
这是我见过的最酷的东西
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen--

174
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,270
-快点  -我不明白
- Let's go. - But I don't understand.

175
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,010
这是给我的吗  哈皮  哈皮  等等
Is it for me? Happy. Happy, wait.

176
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,970
这太疯狂了  太疯狂了
This is insane. Insane.

177
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,870
看这个啊  看看这眼睛
Look at this thing. Look. Look at the eyes.

178
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,270
-这是我人生最棒的一天  -快点换吧
- The greatest day of my life. - Let's go. Come on.

179
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,890
好了  那是美国队长  钢铁侠  黑寡妇
Okay, there's Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow.

180
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,390
-那个新来的是谁  -内衣宝宝
- Who's that new guy? - Underoos!

181
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,320
叫我呢  我得走了
Oh, that's me. I gotta go. I gotta go.

182
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,300
大家好
Hey, everyone.

183
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,100
好吧  刚刚太疯狂了
Okay, so the craziest thing just happened.

184
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,400
我跟美国队长打了一架
I just had a fight with Captain America.

185
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,680
我偷了他的盾  还拿盾丢他
I stole his shield. I threw it at him--

186
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,320
搞什么  他变大了  我得走了  等等
What the hell? He's big now. I gotta go. Hang on.

187
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,310
简直太赞了
It was the most amazing thing that ever happened!

188
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,680
斯塔克先生喊  "内衣宝宝"
Mr. Stark was like, "Hey, underoos!"

189
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,760
我就一个翻身偷了美队的盾
I flipped in and stole Cap's shield.

190
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,170
我还说  "大家好啊"
I was like, "What's up, everybody?"

191
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,080
然后  等一下
And then-- hey, just a second!

192
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,090
来了
Coming!

193
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,120
墙不太隔音
We have thin walls here.

194
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,610
你干什么呢  做视频日志吗
What are you doing, a little video diary?

195
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,210
-是啊  -没事
- Yeah. - It's all right.

196
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,870
-换了我也会的  -我叫他别了
- I'd do the same thing. - I told him not to.

197
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,890
他什么都拍  我会抹掉芯片的
He was filming everything. I'm gonna wipe the chip.

198
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,590
知道吗  我们反正也该拍段视频
You know what? We should make an alibi video

199
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,180
当托辞骗你婶婶  准备好了吗
for your aunt anyway. You ready?

200
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,820
-托辞  -拍了吗
- An alibi? - We rolling?

201
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,980
-好啊  -到镜头里来
- Sure. - Get in the frame.

202
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,680
好了
Okay.

203
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,150
梅  你好吗
Hey, May. How you doing?

204
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,890
你穿着什么呢  希望是布料少的
What are you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.

205
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,350
彼得  这么说不太好
Peter, that's inappropriate.

206
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,110
重来吧  你可以剪辑一下
Let's start over. You can edit it.

207
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,430
三  二  一  你好啊  梅
Three, two, one. Hey, may.

208
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,010
天呐  我想告诉你
My gosh, I wanted to tell you

209
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,050
你侄子这周末在斯塔克实习基地
what an incredible job your nephew did this weekend

210
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,630
表现得太出色了
at the Stark internship retreat.

211
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,590
大家都交口称赞
Everyone was impressed.

212
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,110
拜托
Come on!

213
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,240
并道啊  抱歉
It's a freaking merge. Sorry.

214
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,890
谁叫你不走皇后大道
Because you're not on Queens Boulevard.

215
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,480
哈皮本希望
See, Happy is hoping

216
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,120
能升职到资产管理部
to get bumped up to asset management.

217
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,820
他本是安保主管  再之前是个司机
He was forehead of security, before that he was a driver.

218
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,270
那是私人谈话
That was a private conversation.

219
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,750
我不喜欢拿这事开玩笑  很难启齿的
I don't like joking about this. It was hard to talk about that.

220
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,790
说真的  他是不是拼命打呼噜来着
No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?

221
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,410
我们到了  到家了
Here we are. End of the line.

222
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,680
哈皮  能让我们单独待会儿吗
Happy, can you give us a moment?

223
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,470
你要我下车吗
You want me to leave the car?

224
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,220
你去把彼得的箱子从后备箱拿出来吧
Why don't you grab Peter's case out of the trunk.

225
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,960
我能留下战衣吗
I can keep the suit?

226
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,840
是的  我们刚刚不正说呢嘛
Yes, we were just talking about it.

227
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,250
但是  帮个忙
Do me a favor, though.

228
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,830
哈皮算是你的负责人
Happy's kind of your point guy on this.

229
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,980
别给他太多压力  别干蠢事
Don't stress him out. Don't do anything stupid.

230
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,620
我看过他的心电图
I've seen his cardiogram.

231
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,530
-好吗  -好
- All right? - Yes.

232
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,320
别做我会做的事
Don't do anything I would do,

233
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,210
更不要做我不会做的事
and definitely don't do anything I wouldn't do.

234
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,590
这之间有一小块灰色区域  就是你的活动范围
There's a little gray area in there. And that's where you operate.

235
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,870
那么我是个复仇者了吗
Wait, does that mean I'm an avenger?

236
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,800
不是
No.

237
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,170
-这个吗  -七楼
- This it? - Seventh floor.

238
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,850
我拿上去吧  不劳您了
I can take that up. You don't have to take it.

239
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,570
-你自己拿啊  -嗯  我自己拿吧
- You're gonna take it? - Yeah, I can take that.

240
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,530
谢谢
Thank you.

241
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,420
那我们下次什么时候...
So when's our next--?

242
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,310
再什么时候去"实习"
When's our next "retreat," you know?

243
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,510
下次任务吗
What, next mission?

244
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,940
对  任务  今后的任务
Yeah, the mission. The missions.

245
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,120
-我们会联络你的  -你有我的号码吗
- We'll call you. - Do you have my numbers?

246
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,730
不  就是会通知你的
No, I mean, we'll call you.

247
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,880
就是有人会打给你的  好吗
Like, someone will call you. All right?

248
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,720
-你团队的人  -那好
- From your team. - Okay. All right.

249
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,780
不是抱你  我就是替你开车门
That's not a hug. I'm just grabbing the door for you.

250
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,610
我们还没那么好呢
We're not there yet.

251
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,070
再见
Bye.

252
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,890
他们会联络我的
They're gonna call me.

253
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,080
你好啊  软蛋·帕克
What's up, Penis Parker?

254
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,580
早上好  中城区科技高中
Rise and shine, Midtown Science and Technology.

255
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,670
学生们  别忘记返校节门票
Students, don't forget about your homecoming tickets.

256
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,840
你返校节有男伴吗
Do you have a date for homecoming?

257
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,930
谢谢  杰森  但我有男伴了
Thanks, Jason, but I already have a date.

258
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,440
-好吧  -嗯
- Okay. - Yeah.

259
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,010
-该死  -你  马上去我办公室
- Damn it. - You, in my office right now.

260
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,670
加入我  我们一起
Join me, and together

261
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,410
建造我的新乐高死星
we'll build my new Llego Death Star.

262
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,370
-什么  -太没劲了
- What? - So lame.

263
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,980
不会吧  太棒了  多少块的
No way. That's awesome. How many pieces?

264
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,760
Three thousand eight hundred and three.

265
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,720
-不可思议  -是啊
- That's insane. - I know.

266
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,250
你想今晚做吗
You want to build it tonight?

267
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,190
今晚不行  我得去斯塔克...
No, I can't tonight. I've got the Stark--

268
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,130
-斯塔克实习  -是啊
- Stark internship. - Yeah, exactly.

269
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,450
总得去做实习
Always got that internship.

270
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,440
是啊  希望
Yeah, well, hopefully,

271
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,310
很快就真能在那儿谋个职了
soon it'll lead to a real job with them.

272
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,370
-那就太棒了  -是吧
- That would be so sweet. - Right?

273
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,710
他会说  "表格做得真好  彼得
He'd be all, "Good job on those spreadsheets, Peter.

274
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,840
给你枚金币"
Here's a gold coin."

275
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,010
我根本不懂工作是什么样的
I don't know how jobs work.

276
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,510
就是这样的
That's exactly how they work.

277
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,650
我会在我家把死星的大体结构搭好
I'll knock out the basic bones of the Death Star at my place.

278
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,760
然后再去你家
I'll come by afterwards.

279
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,540
主要的难点是底座
For the most part, the difficult thing is the base of it.

280
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,200
上部至多两小时就能做好
The top half we can knock out in two hours, tops.

281
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,660
那好啊
That'd be great.

282
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,090
好了  我们如何计算
Okay, so how do we calculate

283
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,200
A点和B点之间的线性加速度
linear acceleration between points a and b?

284
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,120
弗拉士
Flash.

285
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,190
角正弦
It's the product of sine of the angle

286
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,670
乘重力除质量
and gravity divided by the mass.

287
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,320
不对  彼得
Nope. Peter.

288
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,050
还在听吗
You still with us?

289
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,820
在听  在听
Yeah, yeah.

290
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,770
质量抵消了  就是重力乘正弦
Mass cancels out, so it's just gravity times sine.

291
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,990
对  瞧  弗拉士  如果答错
Right. See, Flash, being the fastest

292
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,290
最快也未必是最好的
isn't always the best if you are wrong.

293
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,550
你死定了
You're dead.

294
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,510
今天我们要讨论丹麦物理学家尼尔斯·玻尔
Today we're talking about Danish physicist Niels Bohr,

295
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,450
但相信我  他发现的
but trust me, there's nothing bohr-ing

296
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,030
量子理论  可绝对不无聊
about his discoveries regarding quantum theory.

297
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,610
-丽兹换新上衣了吗  -没有
- Did Liz get a new top? - No.

298
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,740
这件我们见过  只是没配过这条裙子
We've seen that before, but never with that skirt.

299
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,210
丽兹
Liz, hey.

300
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,810
真不错
That looks so good.

301
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,600
我们还是别再盯着看了  否则要像变态了
We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy, though.

302
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,500
已经变态了  你俩真可悲
Too late. You guys are losers.

303
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,230
那为什么跟我们坐一起
Well, then why do you sit with us?

304
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,760
因为我没有朋友
Because I don't have any friends.

305
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,810
下一问题
Let's move to the next question.

306
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,900
最重的自然元素是什么
What is the heaviest naturally-occurring element?

307
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,010
氢是最轻的
Hydrogen's the lightest.

308
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,960
但那不是问题  好吧
That's not the question. Okay. Yeah.

309
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,170
铀
Uranium.

310
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,420
正确  谢谢  亚伯拉罕

458
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,670
-她还不知道吗  -谁都不知道
- She doesn't know? - Nobody knows.

459
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,160
斯塔克先生知道  因为他给我做了战衣
I mean, Mr. Stark knows because he made my suit.

460
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,980
但没别人了
But that's it.

461
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,480
那是托尼·斯塔克做的  你是复仇者吗
Tony Stark made you that? Are you an Avenger?

462
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,100
是啊  差不多吧

463
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,130
-天呐  -你不能告诉任何人
- Oh, geez. - You can't tell anybody about this.

464
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,430
你得保密

465
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,230
-秘密  为什么  -你知道她的
- Secret? Why? - You know what she's like.

466
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,930
她要是知道我每晚都被人追杀
If she finds out people try and kill me every single night,

467
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,620
她就不会允许我再做下去了
she's not gonna let me do this anymore.

468
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,810
拜托了  内德
Come on, Ned, please.

469
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,650
好吧
Okay, okay, okay.

470
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,250
我跟你说实话
I'll level with you.

471
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,910
我觉得我保不了密
I don't think I can't keep this a secret.

472
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,190
这是我遇到过的最棒的事
It's the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.

473

内德  梅绝不能知道
Ned, May cannot know.

474
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,280
我现在不能让她那样担心
I cannot do that to her right now.

475
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,440
知道吗
You know?

476
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,750
她经受了那么多事  我...
I mean, everything that's happened with her, I--

477

真不敢相信
I can't believe this is happening now.

482
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,530
-我能试试战衣吗  -不能
- Can I try the suit on? - No.

483
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,590
它是什么原理  磁铁吗
How's it work? Is it magnets?

484
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,650
那些线你怎么射出来的
How do you shoot the strings?

485
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,070
-明天到学校跟你讲  好吗  -太好了
- I'm gonna tell you about this at school tomorrow, okay? -  Great.

486
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,830
好吧  等一下
Okay, well, wait, then.

487
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,120
你怎么同时做这个和斯塔克的实习
How do you do this and the Stark internship?

488
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,330
这就是斯塔克的实习
This is the Stark internship.

489
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,720
快走吧
Just get out of here.

490
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,270
怎么了
What's the matter?

491
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,560
你不是喜欢肉沙拉吗
Thought you loved larb.

492
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,480
太腻了吗
It's too larby?

493
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,050
不够腻
Not larby enough.

494
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,580
你还要我说几次"腻"
How many times do I have to say "larb" before...

495
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,460
才肯跟我说话
You talk to me?

496
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,210
你知道我爱腻
You know I larb you.

497
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,160
我就是压力大  实习让我好累
I'm just stressed. The internship, and I'm tired.

498
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,500
很忙碌
A lot of work.

499
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,030
斯塔克的实习
The Stark internship.

500
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,730
跟你说  我可不怎么喜欢那个托尼·斯塔克
I have to tell you, not a fan of that Tony Stark.

501
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,010
你总是一心多用  他搞得你心神不宁
You're distracted all the time. He's got you in your head.

502
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,880
深受喜爱的皇后区达尔摩三明治店
...the beloved Queens institution Delmar Sandwiches

503
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:57,910
{\an8}他都叫你做什么
What does he have you doing?

504
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,280
在今晚早些时候的一场爆炸中被毁
was destroyed in an explosion earlier tonight

505
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,440
{\an8}你得相信直觉
You need to use your instincts.

506
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,250
爆炸起因是一场被挫败的自动提款机抢劫
after an ATM robbery was thwarted

507
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,030
而见义勇为的正是皇后区本地的犯罪终结者
by Queens' own colorful local crime stopper,

508
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,070
{\an8}怎么了
What?

509
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,200
蜘蛛侠
The Spider-man.

510
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,840
蜘蛛侠在阻止他们抢劫的过程中
As the Spider-man attempted to foil their heist,

511
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,540
一股强大的冲击波被触发
a powerful blast was set off,

512
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,850
结果切碎了街对面的小店
slicing through the bodega across the street.

513
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,030
奇迹的是  没人受伤
Miraculously, no one was harmed.

514
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,020
你要是看到了这样的事
If you spot something like that happening,

515
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,800
立刻调头就跑
you turn and you run the other way.

516
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,060
嗯嗯  当然了
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.

517
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,710
离我们就六个街区
Six blocks away from us.

518
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,480

00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,590
-糯米布丁  -我们没点那个
- Sticky rice pudding. - We didn't order that.

522
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,590
请你们的
It's on the house.

523
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,400
谢谢
Thanks.

524
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,730
他真好心
That's nice of him.

525
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,590
我觉得他喜欢腻
I think he larbs you.

526
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,410
你被一只蜘蛛咬了
You got bit by a spider?

527
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,600
能让它咬咬我吗
Can it bite me?

528
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,710
大概挺疼的吧
Well, it probably would've hurt, right?

529
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,650
算了  就算真疼  我也忍了
Whatever. Even if it did hurt, I'd let it bite me.

530
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,610
或许吧  到底多疼
Maybe. How much did it hurt?

531
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,030
那只蜘蛛死了  内德
The spider's dead, Ned.

532
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,170
你当时在场
You were here?

533
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,390
是啊
Yeah.

534
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,100
你可能会没命呢
You could've died.

535
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,100

Do you lay eggs?

536

不能  内德
No, Ned.

没试过  闭嘴
It's unknown. Shut up.

543
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,560
开始管理...
--to begin regulating...

544
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,120
我要是你  就站在一栋建筑边缘
If I was you, I would stand on the edge of a building

545
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,960
-尽量往远了射  -闭嘴啦  内德

但管他呢  我必须给你们看视频

565
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,490
比如  如果你困在了火场里

566
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,220
我可以告诉你该去哪

你都不知道他长什么样
You don't know what he looks like.

582
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,160
要是他严重烧伤了呢
What if he's seriously burned?

583
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:02,070
我不会在乎  我还是会爱他的为人
I wouldn't care. I'd still love him for the person he is inside.

584
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,350
彼得认识蜘蛛侠

太赞了  这样吧
Well, that's awesome. Hey, you know what?

蜘蛛侠不是派对猴戏  好吗
Spider-man is not a party trick, okay?

那是穿红衬衫的内德
That's just Ned in a red shirt.

656
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,630
好啊  我是蜘蛛侠

哥们  我只想要点低调的东西

只有我们卖这些个高科技武器
We're the only ones selling these high-tech weapons.

自动提款机劫匪肯定就从他们这儿买的武器

以为你甩掉我了  是吧

706
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,230
惊不惊喜

然后他像个怪物似的一个猛子扎下来

带我飞了好高  然后又把我丢了下来

711
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,470
你怎么找到我的
How'd you find me?

712
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,180
你在我的战衣上装了追踪器吗
Did you put a tracker in my suit or something?

那个带翅膀的男人显然是武器的源头

722
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,960
这种事不值得他们出手
This is a little below their pay grade.

723
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,350
总之  斯塔克先生  您不必大老远赶来的
Anyway, Mr. Stark, you didn't have to come all the way out here.

先帮助小人物  循序渐进

但我现在已经准备好承担更多责任了
But I'm ready for more than that now.

不  你没有
No, you're not.

741
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,370
我迎战美国队长时  你可不是这么想的
That is not what you thought when I took on Captain America.

742
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,320
相信我  孩子

747
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,770
考虑大学的事永远不嫌早
You know, it's never too early to start thinking about college.

748
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,300
我在麻省理工有关系  结束通话

这可好
That's awesome.

752
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,740
"脚踏实地"  他说什么呢
"Stay close to the ground"? What is he talking about?

753
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,090
伙计  怎么了  我正要回去
Man, what's up? I'm on my way back.

或许他们能引我找到把我丢进湖里的人

852
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,320
有人把你丢进了湖里

Got a blip on my screen here. You left New York?

908
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,900
-好了  各位注意  -追踪器
- Okay, focus up, everyone. - Tracker.

909
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,450
是啊  学校旅行  没事的
Yeah, it's just a school trip. It's nothing.

910
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:00,640
哈皮  我得说
Look, Happy, I gotta say,

911
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,920
你这样不经我允许追踪我
you tracking me without permission

912
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,000
完全侵犯了我的隐私
is a complete violation of my privacy.

913
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,230
-那不一样  -什么不一样
- That's different. - What's different?

914
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,670
没什么  听着  只是学术竞赛而已
Nothing. Look, it's just the academic decathlon.

915
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:09,940
不是什么大事
It's no big deal.

916
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:12,260
是不是大事我说了算
I'll decide if it's no big deal.

917
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:15,510
听起来的确不是大事
Sounds like it's no big deal,

918
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:17,110
但你记住  我在看着你
but remember, I'm watching you.

919
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,130
-大家跟紧了  -对
- Everyone stick together. - Yeah.

920
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:33,290
你逗我吗  这地方好大
You kidding me? This place is huge.

921
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,960
-我见过更大的  -里面有只鸟
- I've seen bigger. - There's a bird in here.

922
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:37,750
你带电脑了吧
You brought your laptop, right?

923
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:39,390
干什么
Why?

924
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,080
彼得
Peter,

925
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:51,230
为什么要去掉你战衣上的追踪器
why are we removing the tracker from your suit?

926
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:55,200
因为我要在这些人再次转移前
Because I gotta follow these guys to their boss

927
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,670
跟着他们找到他们的老大
before they move again

928
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,180
而且我不想让斯塔克先生知道
and I don't really want Mr. Stark to know about it.

929
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,710
你要对钢铁侠撒谎
So you're lying to Iron Man now?

930
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,080
不  不是撒谎
No, I'm not lying.

931
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,560
他只是还不知道我的能耐
He just doesn't really get what I can do yet.

932
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:11,800
好了
Gotcha.

933
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,770
好了  哈皮  追踪台灯去吧
All right, Happy, enjoy tracking this lamp.

934
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,060
这里还有一堆其他的子系统
There's a ton of other subsystems in here.

935
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,610
但都被辅助轮协议禁用了
But they're all disabled by the Training Wheels Protocol.

936
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:27,760
什么
What?

937
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,570
辅助轮协议
"Training Wheels Protocol"?

938
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,460
关掉
Turn it off.

939
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,160
这样不好吧
I don't think that's a good idea.

940
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:34,990
禁用大概是有原因的
I mean, they're probably blocked for a reason.

941
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,540
拜托  我不需要辅助轮
Come on, man, I don't need training wheels.

942
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:40,020
我受够了他一直把我当小孩
I'm sick of him treating me like a kid all the time.

943
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,210
-太过分了  -但你确实是小孩
- It's not cool. - But you are a kid.

944
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,590
是啊  一个能徒手拦下大巴的小孩
Yeah, a kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands.

945
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,810
彼得  我觉得这样做不好
Peter, I just don't think this is a great idea.

946
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:48,650
要是是违法的怎么办
I mean, what if this is illegal?

947
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:49,670
求你了
Look, please.

948
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,610
这是我证明自己的机会
This is my chance to prove myself.

949
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:53,740
我能行的  内德  来吧
I can handle it. Ned, come on.

950
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,430
我真觉得这样不好
I really don't think this is a good idea.

951
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:56,960
技术支援啊
The guy in the chair.

952
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,180
-别勾我  -来吧
- Don't do that. - Come on.

953
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:15,580
发光物是证据  保管好  好吗
The glowy thing, it's evidence. Keep it safe, all right?

954
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,910
好  好
Okay. Okay.

955
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,330
-他们在移动  -小心点

956
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,080
-丽兹  -时间掐得刚好
- Hey, Liz. - Perfect timing.

957
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:27,440

959
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:30,870
彼得
Hey, Peter.

960
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,100
我正要去商务中心学习
I was-- I was gonna go study in the business center.

961
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,040
彼得  你不用学习了
Peter, you don't need to study.

962
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,790
你是我认识的最聪明的人
You're, like, the smartest guy I've ever met.

963
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:45,120
而且  比赛前一天
And besides, a rebellious group activity

964
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,300
集体进行反叛活动  有助于鼓舞士气
the day before competition is good for morale.

965
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,740
我在TED演讲里读到的
Well, I read that in a Ted talk, so--

不敢相信他们还在清理三曲翼总部

00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,440
-战衣姐姐  那是什么  -你叫我选的

00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,640
我不确定
I'm not sure.

1055
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:01,520
集装箱壁隔绝了我的传感器
The container walls are hindering my sensors.

1056
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:03,840
等等
Wait a minute.

1057
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,600
他们肯定是劫持了卡车
They must have hijacked the truck

1058
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,310
把我带回了他们的邪恶老巢
and taken me to their evil lair.

1059

你在东海岸最安全的设施内

1066
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:30,830

战衣姐姐  我觉得不该

一直喊你"战衣姐姐"  知道吗
calling you "Suit Lady," you know?

1071
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,750
我或许该给你起个名字
I think I should probably give you a name...

1072
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,610
比如丽兹  不不
Like Liz. No, no, no.

1073
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:50,600
天呐  那太怪了
God, that's-- that's weird.

1074
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,400
凯伦呢
What about Karen?

1075
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,770
如果你想  可以喊我凯伦

什么
What?

1078
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,800
或许我们该运行一下复习课程

1082
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:11,730
-蛛网手雷  -蛛网手雷
- Web grenade. - Web grenade!

1083
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,420
我该告诉丽兹我是蜘蛛侠吗
Should I tell Liz that I'm Spider-man?

1084
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,970
丽兹是谁
Who is Liz?

1085
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:20,070

00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:22,750
她最棒了  她好赞

1087
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,770
她是我们学校的一个姑娘
She's just a girl who goes to my school.

1088
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,590

00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:28,500
我真的很想告诉她
Yeah, I just-- I really want to tell her,

1090
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,780
但这有点怪怪的
but it's kind of weird, you know?

1091
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,880
"我是蜘蛛侠"
"I'm-- I'm Spider-man."

1092
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,430
这有什么奇怪的
What's weird about that?

1093
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:37,600
要是她以为我会是托尼·斯塔克那样的人呢
What if she's expecting someone like Tony Stark?

1094
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,790
等她看到是我  得多失望啊
Imagine how disappointed she'd be when she sees me.

1095
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:41,660
如果我是她

1096
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,570
我就一点不会失望
I wouldn't be disappointed at all.

1101
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,120

1102
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,370
我再也受不了了
I cannot take this anymore.

1103
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,330

这就像那个发光物

那个发光物是爆炸性齐塔瑞能量核
That glowy thing is an explosive Chitauri energy core.

1110
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,910
你是说我们一直到处带着枚炸弹
You mean, we've been carrying around a bomb?

1111
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:19,690
得有辐射才会让它
It would require radiation to transform it

1112
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:21,400
进入易爆状态
into an explosive state.

1113
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,850

01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:58,080
好了  天呐
Okay. Oh, my god.

1200
01:01:58,270 --> 01:01:59,080
好了
Okay.

1201
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:03,720
怎么了  你已经到达西南窗口了
What's wrong? You've reached the southwest window.

1202
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,050
-你为什么犹豫不前  -没事
- Why are you hesitating? - It's fine.

1203
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:07,230
我就是从没爬过这么高
I've just never been this high before.

1204
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:09,800
而且你还没有重装你的降落伞
You have also not reinstalled your parachute,

1205
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,520
如果从这么高掉下去  很可能会致命
so a fall from this height would most likely be lethal.

1206
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,140
太好了
Perfect.

1207
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:16,900
天呐
Oh, my god.

1208
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:20,040
它怎么不碎
Why is it not breaking?

1209
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,330
是10厘米厚的防弹玻璃
It's four-inch ballistic glass.

1210
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:23,150
你得制造更大的动量
You'll have to create more momentum.

1211

这里是特区警察  上报身份

1216
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,770

Return to the ground or we will open fire!

1220
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,490

Go up, go up.

1221
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,070
我行的
I got this.

1222
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:19,680
拿着我的奖杯
Take my trophy!

1223
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:23,860
这是你最后的机会
This is your last chance!

1224
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:25,680
我死定了
I'm gonna die.

1225
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:27,710
小心
Look out!

1226

我成功了
I did it!

1227
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:06,590
你们好吗
How you doing?

1228
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:08,010
别担心  有我呢
Don't worry about it. I got you.

1229
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,700
太好了
Yes! Yes!

1230
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:11,690
大块头  别乱动了
Big guy, quit moving around.

1231
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,320
抱歉  先生  真抱歉
I'm sorry, sir. So sorry.

1232
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:17,910

1248
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:09,960

我可以完成下一单
I can finish the next order,

1250
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:21,350
但没有车上的新材料
but without any new materials from that truck...

1251
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,070
是啊  该死
Yeah, damn it.

1252
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,530
我们还有足够物料完成盖根的订单吧
We still have enough to do the Gargan deal though, right?

1253
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:28,890
嗯  然后就没了
Yeah, but then that's it.

1254
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:36,160
或许我该做高空密封装置了
Maybe it is time that I built the high-altitude seal.

1255
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,970
-你能不能别再念叨了  -就那一票
- Would you shut up about that? - It's only one job.

1256
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:38,920
不行
No.

1257
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:43,520
八年了  条子毫无动静
Eight years, not a word from the feds,

1258
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,200
斯塔克塔上那些穿万圣节服装的白痴
nothing from those Halloween-costume-wearing bozos

1259
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,910
也没来找过事
up there in Stark tower.

1260
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,150
然后突然
And then all of a sudden,

1261
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:52,900
冒出这么个穿红紧身衣的小混蛋
this little bastard in red tights shows up

1262
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:56,320
就以为自己能毁掉我所建立的一切
and he thinks he can tear down everything I've built.

1263
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,490
是吗
Really?

1264
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:02,380
我要杀了他
I'm gonna kill him.

1265
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,650
-我要找到他  -找到了
- I'm gonna find him-- - I found him.

这位蒙面英雄的身份仍不清楚

1270

彼得  过来
Peter? Come here, come here.

1271
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:21,320

当天晚些时候  他们还战胜了死神

到处是紫激光  还有烟
There were purple lasers and smoke everywhere.

1278
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:38,070
太...紧张  就像邦·乔维演唱会
It was... tight, like a Bon Jovi concert.

1279
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:39,650
大家知道  我们活下来了
As you know, we made it out alive,

1280
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:41,070
这才是最重要的
and that's the important thing.

1281
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:44,220
我可受不了在学校出行期间有学生出事
I couldn't bear to lose a student on a school trip.

1282
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,150
不能再来一次了
Not again.

1283
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:49,810
幸好  没人受重伤
Thankfully, no one was seriously injured,

1284
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:51,260
这要多谢蜘蛛侠
thanks to the Spider-man.

01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,700
-谢谢你  蜘蛛侠  -谢谢你  蜘蛛侠
- Thank you, Spider-man. - Thank you, Spider-man.

1288
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:05,480
哥们

What is it like being famous when nobody knows it's you?

1290

1293
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:15,110
不行  哥们  那可不好
No, dude. That's not a good idea.

1294
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:16,740
好吧  走  我们上课要迟了

我不去上课了

你在竞赛时抛弃了我们  已经闯大祸了
You're already in so much trouble for ditching us at the decathlon.

哥们  听着  我想明白了
Dude, listen, I figured it out.

1298
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,170
翅膀男在偷损害控制的东西
The wingsuit guy is stealing from Damage Control.

1299

他把从损害控制偷的东西

1300
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,090
做成武器
that's how he builds the weapons.

1301
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:28,760
我只需要抓到他
So all I gotta do is catch him.

1302
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,210
但我们还有西班牙语测试呢
But we have a Spanish quiz.

1303
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:32,640
内德  我可能再也不回来了

高中现在根本罩不住我了

你搞砸了  你知道你做错了

1312
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:56,640
问题是  你要如何弥补
The question is, how are you gonna make things right?

1313
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,300
或许你是想扮酷
Maybe you were trying to be cool.

1314
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:01,570
但听我一个冻了65年的人一句劝
But take it from a guy who's been frozen for 65 years,

1315
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:05,020
真正想酷  就只能遵守规矩
the only way to really be cool is to follow the rules.

1316
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:08,170
我们都分得清对错
We all know what's right. We all know what's wrong.

1317
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:09,650
下次再有人
Next time those turkeys try to

1318
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:11,490
想在你面前颠倒黑白
convince you of something you know is wrong...

1319
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:13,880
-你去哪  回来  -就想想  
- Where you going? Get back here. - Just think to yourself,

1320
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:15,690

1321
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:18,180
你干吗坐这儿  你根本没被留堂
Why are you here? You don't even have detention.

我就是喜欢来这儿  画处于危机中的人

那个  能帮我个忙吗
Listen, I was wondering if you could help me.

1331
01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:52,960
我想查明那晚
I'm trying to figure out who the guys

1332
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,210
桥下的人的身份
under the bridge were that night,

1333
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:56,970
但我只能记住部分的车牌号

1334
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:59,880
我可以用当晚的视频进行面部识别
I can run facial recognition on the footage of that encounter.

1335

01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,380
你做得够多了
I think you've done enough.

1491
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:47,120
就这样了  你要逃跑了
So that's it? You're just gonna run?

1492
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:51,890
联调局埋伏在那里
Feds were waiting for us.

1493
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:54,720
现在我们又被钢铁侠盯上了
Now we're on Iron Man's radar?

1494
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:57,210
对  我是要逃跑
Yeah, I'm running.

1495
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,860
你也该跑
You should too.

1496
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:02,130
你知道我不能
You know I can't do that.

1497
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:03,500
那现在怎么办
So now what?

1498
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:04,970
梅森
Mason,

1499
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:08,810
你能及时做好那个高空密封装置吗
can you get that high-altitude seal thing up and running in time?

1500
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:10,540
真的吗
Seriously?

1501
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:13,570
能  你不会后悔的
Yes. You will not regret this.

1502
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:17,500
你加入吗
You in?

1503
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:31,110
《彼得闯大祸》前情提要
Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch,

1504
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:33,040
我叫你别管这事
I tell you to stay away from this.

1505
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,980
但你黑进了价值几百万的战衣
Instead, you hacked a multimillion-dollar suit

1506
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,830
好偷偷背着我
so you could sneak around behind my back

1507
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:41,310
做我不让你做的事
doing the one thing I told you not to do.

1508
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:42,500
大家都没事吧
Is everyone okay?

1509
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:44,960
反正你没帮上忙
No thanks to you.

1510
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,700
我没帮上忙
No thanks to me?

1511
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:52,650
那些武器流通在外  我一直想尽办法告诉你
Those weapons were out there and I tried to tell you about it,

1512
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:54,110
但你不听
but you didn't listen.

1513
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:57,200
要是你肯听我的  这些事都不会发生
None of this would've happened if you had just listened to me.

1514
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,160
你要是你真在乎的话  就会亲自来了
If you even cared, you'd actually be here.

1515
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:05,630
我听了  孩子
I did listen, kid.

1516
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:07,700
你以为是谁把联调局叫来的
Who do you think called the FBI, huh?

1517
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:10,580
你知道我是唯一一个相信你的人吗
Do you know I was the only one who believed in you?

1518
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:12,630
其他人都说我疯了
Everyone else said I was crazy

1519
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:15,240
-招来个14岁的小孩  -我15
- to recruit a 14-year-old kid. - I'm 15.

1520
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,810
不  你把嘴闭严了  好吗
No. This is where you zip it, all right?

1521
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:18,090
大人说话别插嘴
The adult is talking.

1522
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:19,680
要是今晚有人死了怎么办
What if somebody had died tonight?

1523
01:21:19,730 --> 01:21:22,210
那可就不一样了  对吧  那是你的责任
Different story, right? 'Cause that's on you.

1524
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:23,880
要是你死了
And if you died,

1525
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,980
我会觉得责任在我
I feel like that's on me.

1526
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:28,390
我可不想良心不安
I don't need that on my conscience.

1527
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:29,640
-是啊  先生  我很抱歉  -是啊
- Yes, sir, I'm sorry. - Yes.

1528
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:30,190
对不起
I'm sorry.

1529
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,100
-对不起也没用  -我明白  
- Sorry doesn't cut it. - I understand.

1530
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,220
我只是想像你一样
I just wanted to be like you.

1531
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:35,930
但我希望你比我强
And I wanted you to be better.

1532
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:38,870
好吧  这样不行
Okay, it's not working out.

1533
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:40,030
我得收回战衣
I'm gonna need the suit back.

1534
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:42,470
-收回多久  -永久收回
- For how long? - Forever.

1535
01:21:42,610 --> 01:21:44,560
-对  就是这样  -不  不  拜托
- Yeah, that's how it works. - No, no. Please. Please.

1536
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:45,950
-快脱吧  -你不明白
- Let's have it. - You don't understand.

1537
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:48,450
这是我的一切  没有这套战衣我一无是处
This is all I have. I'm nothing without this suit.

1538
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,520
如果没有这套战衣你就一无是处
If you're nothing without this suit,

1539
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,270
那你就不配拥有它  好吗
then you shouldn't have it, okay?

1540
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:54,390
天哪  我口气跟我爸一样
God, I sound like my dad.

1541
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,920
我没别的衣服了
I don't have any other clothes.

1542
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:01,040
好吧  我们会想办法的
Okay, we'll sort that out.

1543
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:19,590
我给你打了一天电话
I've been calling you all day.

1544
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:21,170
你一直不接
You didn't answer your phone.

1545
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:22,640
你不能这样做
You can't do that.

1546
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:25,030
然后渡轮出了事
Then this ferry thing happens.

1547
01:22:26,050 --> 01:22:28,740
我打电话问了五个警局
I've called five police stations.

1548
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,340
五个  我还给你五个朋友打了电话
Five. I called five of your friends.

1549

我知道你离开了华盛顿的酒店房间
I know you left the hotel room in Washington.

1554
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,490
我知道你每天晚上都从家偷溜出去
I know you sneak out of this house every night.

1555
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:45,730
这可不行
That's not fine.

1556
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,200
彼得  你得告诉我到底怎么了
Peter, you have to tell me what's going on.

1557
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,600
说出来吧  这里只有我们两个
Just lay it out. It's just me and you.

1558
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:54,280
我丢了在斯塔克的实习工作
I lost the Stark internship.

1559

我只是以为我可以努力工作
I just thought that I could work really hard

1562
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:02,440
然后他就会...就会...
and he could-- he would-- you know.

1563
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,240
但是...我搞砸了
But...I screwed it up.

1564
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,760
没事的  没事的
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

1565
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:10,580
没事的
It's okay.

1566
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,790
抱歉我让你担心了
I'm sorry I made you worry.

1567
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:16,760
你明白我并不是想毁掉你的生活
You know I'm not trying to ruin your life.

1568
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:17,860
我明白

1569
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:18,900

Just--

1570
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:22,150
-我以前也会偷溜出去  -嗯

你身上一股...垃圾味儿
You smell like-- you smell like garbage.

1573
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:31,280
我知道
I know.

1574
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,490
彼得  你是个好孩子  聪明的孩子
Peter, you're a good kid and you're a smart kid,

1575
01:23:37,490 --> 01:23:39,540
所以  把精神用在正地方  好吗
so just try to keep your head straight, okay?

1576
01:23:40,990 --> 01:23:41,730
好
Okay.

1577
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:43,580
好了  出去吧
All right, get out of here.

你是不是要去46街那个高中
Do you have to go to that school on 46th

1580
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,300
他们校长有把十字弩
where their principal has a crossbow?

1581
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:57,860
那八成只是街头传闻
Pretty sure that's an urban myth,

1582
01:23:57,860 --> 01:23:59,310
不  我没有被开除
and, no, I'm not expelled.

1583

-没关系  -真抱歉

1592
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:11,110
不  我只是...
No, I just-- I'm--

1593
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:12,690

it was not cool, especially...

1595
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:19,330

你知道
You do?

你太不会保密了
You're terrible at keeping secrets.

1600
01:25:32,450 --> 01:25:34,460
这你就不知道了
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

我得去上课了  但是...

1604
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:46,620
留很久  但是...
Ever, but--

1605
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:50,080
我猜你已经有返校节舞会舞伴了
I guess you already have a date to homecoming.

1606
01:25:50,130 --> 01:25:51,700
其实  我一直在忙着准备
Actually, I was so busy planning it,

1607
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:54,000

或者威士忌之类的
or a scotch, or something like that?

1644
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:36,460
我还没到能喝酒的年龄
I'm not old enough to drink.

1645

That's the right answer.

先生  你不用开车送我们的

不不  小事一桩

我正要出城  顺路

没有  我还在读高二

彼得在托尼·斯塔克的公司实习

其实我已经不在他那里实习了

无聊吗
It was boring?

1690

你还有机会见蜘蛛侠呢

1780
01:36:41,490 --> 01:36:42,730
但我知道新鲜柠檬鲈鱼什么味儿
I know when branzino's fresh,

1781

01:54:36,550 --> 01:54:38,120
他就...
He was just, like...

1943
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,010
你就...
And you were like, "Ah!"

1944
01:54:41,130 --> 01:54:43,150
然后我拿那个打中了他
And then I just hit him with the "Fffew."

1945
01:54:43,150 --> 01:54:44,860
简直...天呐
It was so-- oh, my god.

1946
01:54:45,230 --> 01:54:46,380
你救了我
You saved me.

1947
01:54:47,490 --> 01:54:48,340
太赞了
It was awesome.

1948
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:56,060
丽兹
Liz.

1949
01:54:58,360 --> 01:54:59,600
我会想你的
I'm gonna miss you.

1950
01:55:00,050 --> 01:55:00,920
再见
Bye.

1951
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:03,070
丽兹
Liz.

1952
01:55:10,530 --> 01:55:12,150
丽兹  我很抱歉
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.

1953
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:13,510
你老说抱歉
You say that a lot.

1954
01:55:13,510 --> 01:55:15,140
这次又是为了什么
What are you sorry for this time?

1955
01:55:17,310 --> 01:55:18,190
舞会的事
The dance?

1956
01:55:19,420 --> 01:55:22,580
那是挺过分的
That was a pretty crappy thing to do.

1957
01:55:22,710 --> 01:55:24,790
是啊  但是  你爸爸
Well, yeah, but I-- I mean, your dad--

1958
01:55:24,790 --> 01:55:26,510
我无法想象你现在的感觉
I can't imagine what you're going through.

1959
01:55:26,910 --> 01:55:28,550
要是我能帮上什么
If there's anything I can do to help...

1960
01:55:29,350 --> 01:55:31,450
我猜我们要搬去俄勒冈州了
I guess we're moving to Oregon.

1961
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:35,320
妈妈说那里挺不错的  所以还好了
Mom says it's nice there, so that's cool.

1962
01:55:36,110 --> 01:55:39,620
反正  爸爸不希望我们庭审期间待在这里
Anyways, dad doesn't want us here during the trial, so...

1963
01:55:41,740 --> 01:55:43,640
丽兹  我
Liz, I-- I--

1964
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:45,610
再见  彼得
Bye, Peter.

1965
01:55:47,180 --> 01:55:48,340
不管你究竟有什么事
Whatever's going on with you,

1966
01:55:48,340 --> 01:55:49,830
我希望你能解决
I hope you figure it out.

1967
01:56:03,130 --> 01:56:06,700
恭喜  学术竞赛全国冠军们
Congratulations, decathlon national champions.

1968
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:08,250
好啊
Yeah!

1969
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:11,120
我稍后要把这个放回奖杯陈列柜里
I'm gonna have to put this back in the trophy case soon,

1970
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:14,040
现在练习期间  放在这里作为激励
but just for motivation right now at this practice.

1971
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:15,330
我有点超前了
I'm a little ahead of the game,

1972
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:17,760
但我们明年需要位新队长
but we will need a new team captain next year.

1973
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:20,470
所以我要指派米歇尔
So I am appointing Michelle.

1974
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:22,550
好啊
Yeah!

1975
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:26,410
谢谢
Thank you.

1976
01:56:26,710 --> 01:56:28,410
我的朋友喊我MJ
My-- my friends call me MJ.

1977
01:56:28,890 --> 01:56:30,570
你不是没有朋友吗
I thought you didn't have any friends.

1978
01:56:30,790 --> 01:56:32,720
现在有了
I didn't.

1979
01:56:37,870 --> 01:56:39,950
-我得走了  -你要去哪
- I gotta go. - Hey, where you going?

1980
01:56:42,590 --> 01:56:44,620
你在隐瞒什么  彼得
What are you hiding, Peter?

1981
01:56:46,910 --> 01:56:48,410
开玩笑的  我才不关心  去吧
I'm just kidding. I don't care. Bye.

1982
01:56:48,410 --> 01:56:50,560
好了  我们该排练一下
All right, so we should run some drills.

1983
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:51,390
嗯
Yeah.

1984
01:56:59,970 --> 01:57:03,320
哈皮  你怎么在这里
Happy. What-- what are you doing here?

1985
01:57:04,130 --> 01:57:05,400
我真的欠你个人情
I really owe you one.

1986
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:09,270
我要是没了这份工作真不知如何是好
I don't know what I would do without this job.

1987
01:57:09,980 --> 01:57:11,620
我认识托尼之前
I mean, before I met Tony--

1988
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:43,590
你在这里待了多久了
So how long you been here?

1989
01:57:43,590 --> 01:57:46,070
反正是够尴尬了  老板想见你
Long enough to be awkward. Boss wants to see you.

1990
01:57:46,860 --> 01:57:47,960
他也在这里吗
Is he here too?

1991
01:57:48,060 --> 01:57:50,010
在厕所里吗  不  他在州北
In the toilet? No, he's upstate.

1992
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:51,990
州北  就那个地方吗
Upstate? Like, upstate-upstate?

1993
01:57:51,990 --> 01:57:53,120
是啊  走吧
Yeah, let's go.

1994
01:57:54,890 --> 01:57:55,690
看看
Take a look.

1995
01:57:56,110 --> 01:57:57,410
挺气派吧
It's pretty impressive, huh?

1996
01:57:59,150 --> 01:58:01,170
他们刚完成整体重装
They just finished remodeling the whole thing.

1997
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:29,420
这可不是每天都看得见的
You don't see that every day.

1998
01:58:29,420 --> 01:58:30,520
他们来了
There they are.

1999
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:33,010
来得路上怎么样
How was the ride up?

2000
01:58:34,050 --> 01:58:34,700
挺好的
Good.

2001
01:58:34,700 --> 01:58:35,960
让我跟这孩子单独谈会儿
Give me a minute with the kid.

2002
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:38,550
-真的吗  -是的
- Seriously? - Yeah.

2003
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:40,940
我得跟孩子谈谈
I got to talk to the kid.

2004
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:42,730
我就跟在后面
I'll be close behind.

2005
01:58:43,010 --> 01:58:44,150
跟远点吧
How about a loose follow?

2006
01:58:44,150 --> 01:58:45,720
行吗  距离产生美
All right? Boundaries are good.

2007
01:58:51,610 --> 01:58:52,920
抱歉我拿走了你的战衣
Sorry I took your suit.

2008
01:58:53,050 --> 01:58:54,270
虽然你是活该
I mean, you had it coming.

2009
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:56,020
事实证明  这是正合适的
Actually, it turns out it was the perfect

2010
01:58:56,020 --> 01:58:57,700
你需要的严厉管教  是吧
sorta tough-love moment that you needed, right?

2011
01:58:57,700 --> 01:58:59,670
敦促你发奋  你说是吧
To urge you on? Right? Wouldn't you think?

2012
01:58:59,670 --> 01:59:00,870
-是吧  -嗯
- Don't you think? - Yeah.

2013
01:59:00,870 --> 01:59:02,100
-大概是吧  -就算是吧
- I guess. - Let's just say it was.

2014
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:05,130
斯塔克先生  我...
Mr. Stark, I really--

2015
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:08,100
你闯了大祸
You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime.

2016
01:59:08,380 --> 01:59:09,830
但之后你做了正确的事
But then you did the right thing.

2017
01:59:10,250 --> 01:59:11,470
你带狗狗去了免费诊所
Took the dog to the free clinic,

2018
01:59:11,470 --> 01:59:13,620
然后养大了混血狗崽
you raised the hybrid puppies.

2019
01:59:13,620 --> 01:59:14,990
好吧  这个比喻不是很好
All right, not my best analogy.

2020
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:17,770
我错怪你了
I was wrong about you.

2021
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:20,990
我觉得  稍加指教
I think, with a little more mentoring,

2022
01:59:21,550 --> 01:59:23,190
你可以成为团队里有价值的一员
you could be a real asset to the team.

2023
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:27,710
-队员  -是啊
- To the-- to the team? - Yeah. Anyway,

2024
01:59:27,710 --> 01:59:29,340
那扇门后有50来个记者
there's about 50 reporters behind that door.

2025
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:30,820
真记者  不是博主
Real ones, not bloggers.

2026
01:59:31,290 --> 01:59:32,380
等你准备好了
When you're ready,

2027
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:34,740
试试这件吧
why don't you try that on?

2028
01:59:35,220 --> 01:59:37,170
我会向世界介绍
And I'll introduce the world

2029
01:59:37,170 --> 01:59:39,480
复仇者联盟的最新正式成员
to the newest official member of the Avengers:

2030
01:59:39,530 --> 01:59:40,490
蜘蛛侠
Spider-man.

2031
01:59:43,690 --> 01:59:44,470
我...
I--

2032
01:59:46,830 --> 01:59:48,380
嗯  看看吧
Yeah, give that a look.

2033
01:59:54,620 --> 01:59:55,800
发布会之后
So after the press conference,

2034
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:58,140
哈皮会带你回房间  你的新住处
Happy will show you to your room, your new quarters.

2035
01:59:58,210 --> 02:00:00,560
给他安排在哪了  幻视隔壁吗
Where's he between? He's next to Vision?

2036
02:00:00,650 --> 02:00:02,290
嗯  幻视不怎么走门
Yeah, Vision's not big on doors.

2037
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:04,000
-挺好玩的  -还穿墙
- It's fun. - Or walls.

2038
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:05,610
你能很好融入的
You'll fit right in.

2039
02:00:12,820 --> 02:00:14,120
谢谢  斯塔克先生
Thank you, Mr. Stark,

2040
02:00:15,270 --> 02:00:16,450
但是  还是不用了
but I'm-- I'm good.

2041
02:00:17,630 --> 02:00:19,950
不用了  怎么说
You're good? How are you good?

2042
02:00:20,430 --> 02:00:21,790
我是说
Well, I mean,

2043
02:00:21,790 --> 02:00:24,550
我还是想再多脚踏实地一阵子
I'd rather just stay on the ground for a little while.

2044
02:00:24,670 --> 02:00:26,390
做个友善的好街坊蜘蛛侠
Friendly neighborhood Spider-man.

2045
02:00:27,150 --> 02:00:29,040
总得有人去照顾小人物嘛
Somebody's got to look out for the little guy, right?

2046
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:30,400
你要拒绝我吗
You're turning me down?

2047
02:00:31,030 --> 02:00:32,460
你想清楚了  看那个啊
You better think about this. Look at that.

2048
02:00:33,260 --> 02:00:34,080
看我
Look at me.

2049
02:00:35,300 --> 02:00:36,330
最后机会  要不要
Last chance. Yes or no?

2050
02:00:36,330 --> 02:00:37,430
-不要  -好
- No. - Okay.

2051
02:00:37,860 --> 02:00:39,030
这种斯普林斯汀
It's kind of a Springsteen-y,

2052
02:00:39,030 --> 02:00:41,260
工人阶级英雄的气概我还蛮喜欢的
working-class hero vibe that I dig.

2053
02:00:41,610 --> 02:00:43,320
哈皮会送你回家
Happy will take you home.

2054
02:00:43,830 --> 02:00:45,100
-行吧  -好
- Yeah? - Yeah.

2055
02:00:45,490 --> 02:00:47,460
能去车里等着吗  我需要点时间

谢谢  斯塔克先生

02:01:01,940 --> 02:01:03,240
刚刚是试我吧
That was a test, right?

2060
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:05,230
那后面根本没人
There's nobody back there?

2061
02:01:05,230 --> 02:01:06,460
是啊  你通过了
Yes, you passed.

2062
02:01:07,330 --> 02:01:08,650
好了  快走吧
All right, skedaddle there,

02:01:08,650 --> 02:01:10,260

就说他是个好孩子吧
Told you he was a good kid.

2066
02:01:20,230 --> 02:01:21,910
派珀  派珀
Pepper! Pepper!

2067
02:01:22,270 --> 02:01:23,070
那孩子呢
Where's the kid?

2068
02:01:23,070 --> 02:01:24,580
-他走了  -大家都等着呢
- He left. - Everybody's waiting.

2069
02:01:24,580 --> 02:01:26,950
其实  他做了个很成熟的决定
You know what, he actually made a really mature choice.

2070
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:28,490
就是让我们措手不及
It just surprised the heck out of us.

2071
02:01:28,490 --> 02:01:29,980
你们搞砸了吗
Did you guys screw this up?

2072
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:31,230
他叫那孩子去车里等着了
He told the kid to go wait in the car.

2073
02:01:31,230 --> 02:01:34,000
开什么玩笑  那一屋子的人
Are you kidding me? I have a room full of people

2074
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,410
都在等待一个重大消息
and they're waiting for some big announcement.

2075
02:01:35,410 --> 02:01:36,550
我要跟他们说什么
What am I gonna tell them?

2076
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:39,230
想点别的吧  比如
Think of something. How about, um,

2077
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:41,030
哈皮  戒指你还带着吗
Hap, you still got that ring?

2078
02:01:41,030 --> 02:01:41,950
我...
Do I-- I--

2079
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:43,400
-订婚戒指  -开玩笑吗
- the engagement ring. - Are you kidding?

2080
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:45,790
我从2008年带到现在
I've been carrying this since 2008.

2081
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:50,210
好吧
Okay.

2082
02:01:50,630 --> 02:01:52,310
我觉得我能想到比那个好的
I think I can think of something better than that.

2083
02:01:52,310 --> 02:01:53,880
这能给我们争取点时间嘛
Well, it would buy us a little time.

2084
02:01:55,880 --> 02:01:57,540
我们也不需要时间了
Like we need time.

2085
02:01:58,250 --> 02:02:00,010
真不敢相信你把那玩意就揣兜里
I can't believe you have that thing in your pocket.

2086
02:02:00,010 --> 02:02:00,970
要我替你开门吗  亲爱的
Let me to get the door for you, hon?

2087
02:02:00,970 --> 02:02:01,910
我来吧
I got it.

2088
02:02:18,630 --> 02:02:20,260
梅婶婶  你做晚饭了吗
Aunt May, did you do dinner already?

2089
02:02:31,530 --> 02:02:32,360
梅
May?

2090
02:02:55,110 --> 02:02:56,000
怎么回...
What the f--?!

2091
02:05:10,220 --> 02:05:12,330
看看这是谁
Look who it is.

2092
02:05:13,970 --> 02:05:14,840
多巧啊
What are the odds

2093
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:16,830
咱俩进了同一个夏令营
you and I'd end up at the same summer camp?

2094
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:18,870
放松
Relax.

2095
02:05:19,270 --> 02:05:21,130
这  不怪你
This? It's not on you.

2096
02:05:21,440 --> 02:05:24,250
要怪我们那位蜘蛛小朋友
It's on our little spider friend.

2097
02:05:24,700 --> 02:05:26,290
我在外面有人
I've got some boys on the outside

2098
02:05:26,290 --> 02:05:28,220
他们很想认识认识他
who would love to meet him.

2099
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:29,720
拍张合照
You know, take a picture,

2100
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:32,290
割了他的喉咙  把他脑袋塞进烘干机
slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.

2101
02:05:32,430 --> 02:05:34,310
我听到传闻说
And I heard a rumor...

2102
02:05:37,940 --> 02:05:39,470
你知道他的身份
You know who he is.

2103
02:05:43,270 --> 02:05:45,040
要是我知道
If I knew who he was,

2104
02:05:45,820 --> 02:05:47,350
他早就死了
he'd already be dead.

2105
02:05:51,890 --> 02:05:54,500
图姆斯  你的家人来了
Toomes, your family's here!

2106
02:12:34,940 --> 02:12:36,240
我是美国队长
I'm Captain America,

2107
02:12:36,250 --> 02:12:38,490
我要跟你们谈谈  一名士兵或学生能拥有的
here to talk to you about one of the most valuable traits

2108
02:12:38,490 --> 02:12:40,480
最宝贵的品质之一
a soldier or student can have.

2109
02:12:41,050 --> 02:12:42,040
耐心
Patience.

2110
02:12:42,870 --> 02:12:45,150
有时  耐心能换来胜利
Sometimes patience is the key to victory.

2111
02:12:45,150 --> 02:12:47,340
有时  却回报甚少
Sometimes it leads to very little

2112
02:12:47,410 --> 02:12:49,060
会让人觉得很不值
and it seems like it's not worth it.

2113
02:12:49,860 --> 02:12:50,840
你会想
And you wonder

2114
02:12:51,580 --> 02:12:52,760
当初何必等那么久
why you waited so long

2115
02:12:52,760 --> 02:12:54,600
盼来的却是失望
for something so disappointing.

2116
02:12:59,100 --> 02:13:00,270
这玩意还要拍几条
How many more of these?
