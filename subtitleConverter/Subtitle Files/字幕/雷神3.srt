我知道你在想什么
Now, I know what you're thinking.

25
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,300
不  托尔被关在笼子里了  怎么回事
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage. How did this happen?"

26
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,900
有时  你得先被抓住
Well, sometimes you have to get captured

27
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,080
才能从某人那里问出个所以然来
just to get a straight answer out of somebody.

28
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,170
说来话长  但其实  我算是个英雄
It's a long story, but basically, I'm a bit of a hero.

29
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,650
我去地球待了一阵
See, I spent some time on Earth...

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,650
打过几个机器人  救了地球几次
Fought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times.

31
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,330
然后我去宇宙中寻找
Then I went searching through the cosmos

32
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,910
几颗有魔法的多彩的无限宝石
for some magic, colorful Infinity Stone things.

33
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,360
但没找到
Didn't find any.

34
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,580
这时我遇到了一条死亡和毁灭之路
That's when I came across a path of death and destruction,

35
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,250
而因此来到了这个笼子里
which led me all the way here into this cage,

36
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,740
还遇见了你
where I met you.

37
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,850
你觉得我们还要在这里待多久
How much longer do you think we'll be here?

38
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,790
托尔  奥丁之子
Thor, son of Odin.

39
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,510
苏尔特尔  王八之子
Surtur, son of a bitch.

40
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,870
你还活着
You're still alive.

41
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,110
我以为我父亲50万年前杀掉你了
I thought my father killed you like, a half a million years ago.

42
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,880
我不能死
I cannot die.

43
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,860
我还没有实现命运
Not until I fulfill my destiny

44
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,030
毁灭你的家乡
and lay waste to your home.

45
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,840
正好你提起这个了
You know, it's funny you should mention that.

46
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,230
因为我最近一直在做噩梦
Because I've been having these terrible dreams of late.

47
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,670
阿斯加德陷入烈火  成为一片灰烬
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins.

48
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,630
而你  苏尔特尔  处于那一切之中
And you, Surtur, are at the center of all of them.

49
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,870
那你已经见识到了诸神黄昏  阿斯加德的陨落
Then you have seen Ragnarok, the fall of Asgard.

50
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,060
-伟大的预言  -等等
- The great prophecy... - Hang on.

51
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,760
等等
Hang on.

52
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,280
我马上就能转回去
I'll be back around shortly.

53
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,720
我真觉得我们刚刚聊得很投机
I really feel like we were connecting there.

54
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,420
好了  诸神黄昏  跟我讲讲  仔细说说
Okay, so Ragnarok. Tell me about that. Walk me through it.

55
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,320
我的时代到来了
My time has come.

56
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,940
等我的王冠再次沐浴永恒烈火
When my crown is reunited with the Eternal Flame,

57
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,660
我就将恢复全部力量
I shall be restored to my full might.

58
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,980
比山还高
I will tower over the mountains,

59
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,900
把剑深深插入阿斯加德的...
and bury my sword deep in Asgard's...

60
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,010
等等  等一下
Hang on. Give it a second.

61
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,380
我发誓  我根本没动  是它自己在转
I swear, I'm not even moving. It's just doing this on its own.

62
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,170
真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

63
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,630
好了  是这么回事吗
Okay, so let me get this straight.

64
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,980
你要把你的王冠放进永恒烈火里
You're going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame

65
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,410
然后你会突然变得有房子那么大
and then you'll suddenly grow as big as a house?

66
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,470
是山
A mountain!

67
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,930
永恒烈火是奥丁锁在阿斯加德的那个
The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard?

68
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,770
奥丁不在阿斯加德
Odin is not on Asgard.

69
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,420
而你的离开让王权失去了防卫
And your absence has left the throne defenseless.

70
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,780
好吧  那王冠在哪呢
Okay, so where is it? This crown?

71
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,210
这就是我的王冠  我力量的源泉
This is my crown, the source of my power.

72
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,660
那是王冠啊  我以为你是眉毛长得比较夸张
Oh, that's a crown. I thought it was a big eyebrow.

73
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,810
是王冠
It's a crown.

74
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,440
总之  听上去  我想阻止诸神黄昏
Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok

75
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,490
只需要扯下你脑袋上那玩意
is rip that thing off your head.

76
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,290
但诸神黄昏已经开始了
But Ragnarok has already begun.

77
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,790
你无法阻止
You cannot stop it.

78
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,140
我是阿斯加德的末日  你也是
I am Asgard's doom, and so are you.

79
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,180
一切都将遭受煎熬  被烈火吞噬
All will suffer, all will burn.

80
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,430
好紧张
That's intense.

81
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,940
老实说  看着你变得老大
To be honest, seeing you grow really big

82
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,710
然后烧掉一颗星球  肯定很壮观
and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle.

83
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,500
但看来我只能选择第二条路
But it looks like I'm gonna have to choose option B,

84
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,190
那就是我挣脱这铁链
where I bust out of these chains,

85
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,000
把你的头饰从脑袋上砸下来
knock that tiara off your head,

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,270
然后藏在阿斯加德的地堡里
and stash it away in Asgard's vault.

87
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,430
你无法阻止诸神黄昏
You cannot stop Ragnarok.

88
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,800
何必抵抗呢
Why fight it?

89
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,570
因为  英雄都会这么做
Because that's what heroes do.

90
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,590
等等  抱歉  我时机掐得不太好
Wait, I'm sorry. I didn't time that right.

91
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,060
来了
And, now!

92
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,440
{\an9}BGM: Immigrant Song  By  Led Zeppelin

93
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,080
你犯了个大错误  奥丁森
You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.

94
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,690
我经常犯大错误
I make grave mistakes all the time.

95
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,190
看来结果还不错嘛
Everything seems to work out.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,560
海姆达尔  我知道我们好久没联系了
Heimdall, I know it's been a while,

97
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,320
但我真的很需要赶紧离开这里
but I could really use a fast exit.

98
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,050
海姆达尔
Heimdall?

99
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,460
海姆达尔就是个蠢货
Heimdall was an idiot.

100
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,630
这份工作本该让他发财的
This job should have made him rich.

101
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,030
这份工作并不轻松
Now, the job ain't easy

102
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,300
但还是有些好处的
but it does have its benefits.

103
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,870
彩虹桥让我可以接触到
The Bifrost gives me access

104
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,550
九大王国的一切
to everything the Nine Realms has to offer.

105
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,970
我想拿就拿
I mean, it's all mine for the taking.

106
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,670
看啊
Behold...

107
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,080
我的东西
My stuff.

108
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,900
我特别喜欢这俩玩意
I'm particularly fond of these.

109
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,640
我从米德加德一个叫德克萨斯的地方拿到了它们
I pulled them out of a place on Midgard called Texas.

110
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,230
我还给它们起了名字  毁天和灭地
I even named them. Des and Troy.

111
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,130
因为  当它们合在一起
You see, when you put them together,

112
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,460
就能毁天灭地
they destroy.

113
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,300
海姆达尔  拜托了
Heimdall, come on.

114
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,190
别动
Stay!

115
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,260
海姆达尔  我要没招了
Heimdall? I'm running short on options.

116
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,770
海姆达尔
Heimdall?

117
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,730
斯科尔奇
Skurge?

118
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,270
那个要紧吗
Is that important?

119
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,290
你们俩姑娘今天有好戏看了
You girls are in for a treat.

120
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:57,940
姑娘们
Girls!

121
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,910
哎呦呦
Well, well, well.

122
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,490
看看是谁决定回来了
Look who decided to pop in.

123
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,910
感谢你吓跑了我的女伴
Thanks for scaring away my company

124
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,930
还弄得我的办公场所全是脑浆
and drenching my workplace in brains.

125
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,720
你是谁
Who are you?

126
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,040
你不记得了吗  斯科尔奇
Don't you remember? I'm Skurge.

127
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,490
我们曾在华纳海姆并肩作战
We fought together on Vanaheim.

128
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,360
想起来了
Right.

129
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,120
海姆达尔呢
Where is Heimdall?

130
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,210
那个叛徒  没人知道  他是王室逃犯
That traitor. Well, no one knows. He's a fugitive of the throne.

131
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,260
叛徒
Traitor?

132
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,580
对  奥丁指控海姆达尔玩忽职守
Yeah. You see, Odin charged Heimdall with negligence of duty

133
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,660
但他在审判前就消失不见了
but he disappeared before the trial.

134
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,100
想抓住一个能洞察宇宙中一切的人可不容易
Hard to catch a guy who can see everything in the universe.

135
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,230
-是啊  -等等  
- Sure. - Hold on. Hold on.

136
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,230
我要宣告你的到来的
I'm supposed to announce your arrival.

137
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,310
这是什么玩意
What the hell is that?

138
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,900
哥哥  时候到了
Oh, brother. This is it.

139
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,070
我要离世了
I take my leave.

140
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,680
你真傻  怎么不听我的
You fool, you didn't listen!

141
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,710
对不起
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,960
希芙女士  去找人帮忙
Lady Sif, get help!

143
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,540
谁来帮帮忙啊
Somebody, help!

144
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,190
我为我做的一切道歉
I'm sorry for all I've done.

145
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,470
没事的  撑住
It's all right. Hold on.

146
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,920
抱歉我企图统治地球
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.

147
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,500
有你只会是他们的幸运
They'd be lucky to have you.

148
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,590
宇宙魔方的事我也很抱歉
I'm sorry about that thing with the Tesseract.

149
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,450
-我就是忍不住  -我知道
- I just couldn't help myself. - I know.

150
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,610
-我喜欢耍诡计  -是啊
- I'm a trickster. - Yes.

151
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,100
总爱搞恶作剧
So mischievous.

152
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,670
抱歉我那次把你变成了只青蛙
Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog.

153
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,190
那是很有趣的笑话
It was a wonderful joke.

154
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,350
的确是非常好笑
'Twas indeed hilarious.

155
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,010
你是阿斯加德的拯救者
You are the savior of Asgard.

156
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,720
-讲述我的故事  -我会的
- Tell my story. - I will.

157
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,520
为我建一座雕像
Build a statue for me.

158
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,140
我们会为你建一座大雕像的
We will build a big statue for you.

159
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,980
还要戴着我的头盔  有大弯角的那个
With my helmet on, with the big bendy horns.

160
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,370
你的英勇我会禀告父王
I will tell Father what you did here today.

161
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,010
我不是为了他
I didn't do it for him.

162
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,770
我不是为了他
I didn't do it for him.

163
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,320
不
No!

164
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,310
洛基因伤不治而死
And so, Loki died of his wounds,

165
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,610
他为我们献出了生命
giving his life for ours.

166
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,090
他击退了那些可憎的精灵
He fought back those disgusting elves,

167
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,120
为王国带来了和平
he brought peace to the realm.

168
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,730
洛基  我的儿子
Loki, my boy...

169
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,640
多年前  我在那覆满冰霜的战场上发现了你
'Twas many moons ago I found you on that frostbitten battlefield.

170
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,640
那天  我尚未看出你是
On that day, I did not yet see in you

171
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,700
阿斯加德的拯救者  是啊
Asgard's savior. No.

172
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,740
你只是个小蓝冰棍
You were merely a little blue baby icicle

173
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,480
却融化了我这老傻瓜的心
that melted this old fool's heart.

174
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,540
精彩  精彩  演得好
Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.

175
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,970
父亲
Father.

176
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,240
该死
Shit.

177
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,260
我的儿子  托尔回来了
My son, Thor, has returned!

178
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,860
你好  我的孩子
Greetings, my boy.

179
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,170
这出戏真有趣  叫什么
It's an interesting play. What's it called?

180
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,210
《阿斯加德的洛基之惨剧》
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.

181
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,480
人民想纪念他
The people wanted to commemorate him.

182
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,690
他们是该如此
Indeed they should.

183
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,020
我喜欢那座雕像
I like the statue.

184
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,250
比他在世时要好看多了
A lot better looking than he was when he was alive, though.

185
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,080
不那么猥琐  油腻了
A little less weaselly, less greasy, maybe.

186
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,050
你知道这是什么吗
Do you know what this is?

187
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,610
苏尔特尔的头骨  厉害的武器啊
The skull of Surtur. That's a formidable weapon!

188
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,320
帮个忙  把这个锁进地堡
Do me a favor. Lock this away in a vault

189
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,970
免得它变成巨大的怪物
so it doesn't turn into a giant monster

190
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,550
毁了整个星球
and destroy the whole planet.

191
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,030
谢谢  亲爱的
Thank you, dear.

192
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,820
那么你要回米德加德了吗
So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?

193
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,500
不
Nope.

194
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,000
我最近老做同一个梦
I've been having this reoccurring dream lately.

195
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,780
每晚上  我都看到阿斯加德化为灰烬
Every night, I see Asgard fall into ruins.

196
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,710
不过是个没意义的梦
That's just a silly dream,

197
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,890
说明你的想象力太丰富了
signs of an overactive imagination.

198
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,860
或许吧
Possibly.

199
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,960
但我决定出去勘察一番
But then I decide to go out there and investigate.

200
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,140
结果发现  九大王国一片混乱
And what do I find, but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.

201
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,360
阿斯加德的敌人集结起来  阴谋致我们于死地
Enemies of Asgard assembling, plotting our demise,

202
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,380
而你  奥丁  九大王国的保护者
all while you, Odin, the protector of those Nine Realms,

203
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,320
却穿着浴袍坐在这里  吃着葡萄
are sitting here in your bathrobe, eating grapes.

204
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,640
是啊  我们最好尊重邻居的自由
Yes, it is best to respect our neighbors' freedom.

205
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,830
是啊  被屠杀的自由
Yes, of course, the freedom to be massacred.

206
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,680
是啊  而且  我一直忙着呢
Yes, besides I've been rather busy myself.

207
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,570
看剧
Watching theater.

208
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,060
委员会会议  安全理事会会议
Well, board meetings, and security council meetings...

209
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,200
-你真要逼我这么做吗  -做什么
- You're really gonna make me do it? - Do what?

210
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,140
你很清楚什么都无法阻止雷神之锤回到我手上
You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir as it returns to my hand.

211
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,540
哪怕是你的脸
Not even your face.

212
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,380
你发疯了吧  你会被因此处死的
You've gone quite mad. You'll be executed for this.

213
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,930
那我们就可以在另一边相见了  弟弟
Then I'll see you on the other side, brother.

214
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,410
好吧  我投降
All right, I yield.

215
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,430
看啊
Behold!

216
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,480
托尔
Thor...

217
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,040
-奥丁森  -不
- Odinson. - No.

218
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,120
你就一份工作  就这一份
You had one job. Just the one.

219
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,830
奥丁在哪
Where's Odin?

220
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,540
你就不能别回来吗
You just couldn't stay away, could you?

221
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,080
没有你一切都好好的
Everything was fine without you.

222
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,890
阿斯加德繁荣昌盛  都叫你毁了
Asgard was prospering. You've ruined everything.

223
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,120
-问问他们  -父亲在哪  你杀了他吗
- Ask them. - Where's Father? Did you kill him?

224
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,600
你得到你想要的了  你得到你要的独立了
You had what you wanted. You had the independence you asked for.

225
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,760
好吧  我很清楚他在哪
Okay. I know exactly where he is.

226
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,350
我发誓我就是把他留在这儿的
I swear I left him right here.

227
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,780
是在人行道上
Right here on the sidewalk,

228
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,800
还是在那栋正被拆除的建筑里
or right there where the building is being demolished?

229
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,620
计划得真好
Great planning.

230
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,730
我怎么会知道
How was I supposed to know?

231
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,390
我又不能看到未来  我不是巫师
Can't see into the future. I'm not a witch.

232
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,540
是吗  那你为什么穿得像个巫师
No? Then why do you dress like one?

233
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,800
真不敢相信你还活着
I can't believe you're alive.

234
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,230
我看到你死了  我为你哀悼  为你哭泣
I saw you die. I mourned you, I cried for you.

235
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,350
我好荣幸
I'm honored.

236
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,560
去问他
Ask him.

237
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,930
你可以跟我们合个影吗
Would you mind taking a picture with us?

238
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,610
当然
Sure.

239
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,780
快想想他在哪
Start figuring out where he is.

240
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,360
天呐
Oh, my God.

241
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,880
很遗憾简甩了你
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.

242
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,460
她才没甩我
She didn't dump me, you know.

243
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,280
是我甩了她  我们彼此互甩的
I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.

244
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,260
怎么回事  你在做什么
What's this? What are you doing?

245
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,300
这不是我做的
This isn't me.

246
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,450
洛基
Loki.

247
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,300
托尔·奥丁森
Thor Odinson.

248
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,310
雷神
God of Thunder.

249
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,720
你可以把伞放下了
You can put down the umbrella.

250
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,370
地球上现在还有男巫了
So, Earth has wizards now?

251
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,500
我们更喜欢被称为"魔法师"
The preferred term is "Master of the Mystic Arts."

252
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,740
别管了
You can leave that now.

253
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,670
好吧  男巫  你是谁  我为什么要在乎
All right, wizard. Who are you? Why should I care?

254
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,680
我是斯蒂芬·斯特兰奇博士
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange,

255
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,590
我有些问题要问你
and I have some questions for you.

256
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,270
请坐
Take a seat.

257
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,860
喝茶吗
Tea?

258
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,870
我不喝茶
I don't drink tea.

259
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,270
你喝什么
What do you drink?

260
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,320
不喝茶
Not tea.

261
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,500
我有一份关注名单
So, I keep a watch list

262
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,130
都是来自其他世界
of individuals and beings from

263
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,500
可能对这个世界构成威胁的人
other realms that may be a threat to this world.

264
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,210
你的领养弟弟  洛基  就是其中之一
Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings.

265
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,900
的确该加上他
He's a worthy inclusion.

266
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,620
为什么带他来这儿
Then why bring him here?

267
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,040
我们在找我父亲
We're looking for my father.

268
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,720
那么  如果我告诉你奥丁在哪
So, if I were to tell you where Odin was,

269
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,380
所有相关人士都会马上回阿斯加德吗
all parties concerned would promptly return to Asgard?

270
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,390
是的  马上
Promptly.

271
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,290
太好了  我来帮你吧
Great! Then I'll help you.

272
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,810
如果你知道他在哪  为什么不联系我
If you knew where he was, why didn't you call me?

273
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,490
我得告诉你  他坚持不许人打搅他
I have to tell you, he was adamant that he not be disturbed.

274
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,420
你父亲说他选择继续被流放
Your father said he had chosen to remain in exile.

275
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,790
而且你没有电话
And you don't have a phone.

276
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,910
是啊  我没有电话
No, I don't have a phone,

277
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,940
但你可以发个
but you could have sent

278
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,800
电子信件  叫电邮
an electronic letter. It's called an email.

279
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,180
-嗯  你有电脑吗  -没有  干吗用
- Yeah, do you have a computer? - No. What for?

280
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,800
总之  我父亲不再被流放了
Anyway, my father is no longer in exile.

281
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,720
麻烦你告诉我他在哪  我就能带他回家了
So if you could tell me where he is, I can take him home.

282
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,860
没问题  他在挪威
Gladly. He's in Norway.

283
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,860
我就是查看一下
I'm just seeing

284
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:46,290
这则咒语是否要为阿斯加德人做些调整
whether this incantation requires any Asgardian modifications.

285
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,590
不用
Nope.

286
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,910
我们不需要那个
We don't need that.

287
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,760
你能不能别那么做了
Will you stop doing that?

288
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,110
我可以...我需要你一根头发
Can I... I need just one strand of your hair.

289
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,140
我告诉你  我的头发是碰不得的
Let me explain something. My hair is not to be meddled with.

290
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,900
我们完全可以用走的
We could have just walked.

291
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,980
他在等你了
He's waiting for you.

292
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,480
好
All right.

293
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,650
别忘了你的伞
Don't forget your umbrella.

294
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,430
是啊
Yes.

295
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,700
抱歉
Sorry.

296
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,390
来了
There we go.

297
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,650
我还得要回我弟弟
I suppose I'll need my brother back.

298
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,490
对了  好的
Yeah. Right.

299
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,830
我都下落30分钟了
I have been falling for 30 minutes!

300
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,970
他就交给你了
You can handle him from here.

301
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,070
好的  非常感谢你帮忙
Yes. Of course. Thank you very much for your help.

302
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,750
祝你好运
Good luck.

303
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,840
"交给你"  你是谁
Handle me? Who are you?

304
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,740
洛基
Loki.

305
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,330
你是什么术士吗
You think you're some kind of sorcerer?

306
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,850
你个二流货  别以为你...
Don't think for one minute, you second-rate...

307
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,100
好吧  再见
All right. Bye-bye.

308
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,370
父亲
Father?

309
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,750
看看这里  多美
Look at this place. It's beautiful.

310
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,440
父亲  是我们
Father, it's us.

311
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,330
我的儿子们
My sons.

312
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,220
我一直在等你们
I've been waiting for you.

313
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,140
我知道  我们来接你回家了
I know. We've come to take you home.

314
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,930
回家  是啊
Home, yes.

315
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,170
你们母亲  她在召唤我
Your mother, she calls me.

316
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,550
你们听到了吗
Do you hear it?

317
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,850
洛基  解除你的魔法
Loki, lift your magic.

318
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,940
我花了好久才摆脱你的咒语
Took me quite a while to break free from your spell.

319
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,940
弗丽嘉会为你自豪的
Frigga would have been proud.

320
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,260
过来陪我坐下  我没多少时间了
Come and sit with me. I don't have much time.

321
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,840
我知道我们辜负了你
I know we failed you.

322
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,410
但我们可以弥补的
But we can make this right.

323
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,200
是我辜负了你们
I failed you.

324
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,210
诸神黄昏已经到来
It is upon us. Ragnarok.

325
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,130
不  我阻止了诸神黄昏  我了结了苏尔特尔
No, I've stopped Ragnarok. I put an end to Surtur.

326
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,430
不
No.

327
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,060
已经开始了  她要来了
It has already begun. She's coming.

328
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,320
我的生命是唯一遏制着她的东西
My life was all that held her back.

329
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,240
但我大限将至
But my time has come.

330
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,620
我无法再抵住她了
I cannot keep her away any longer.

331
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,470
父亲  你在说谁
Father, who are you talking about?

332
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,900
死亡女神  海拉
Goddess of Death. Hela.

333
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,160
我的长女
My firstborn.

334
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,760
你姐姐
Your sister.

335
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,930
什么
Your what?

336
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,050
她的暴力欲望膨胀到我无法控制
Her violent appetites grew beyond my control.

337
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,500
我无法阻止她  就囚禁了她  把她关了起来
I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her. Locked her away.

338
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,960
她从阿斯加德汲取力量
She draws her strength from Asgard,

339
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,870
等她到了那里  她的力量就将无可限量
and once she gets there, her powers will be limitless.

340
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,310
不管她是什么  我们可以一同阻止她
Whatever she is, we can stop her together.

341
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,860
我们可以一同对抗她
We can face her together.

342
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,870
不行的
No, we won't.

343
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,330
我已走上了另一条路
I'm on a different path now.

344
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,580
这件事你们得独自面对了
This you must face alone.

345
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,660
我爱你们  我的儿子
I love you, my sons.

346
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,060
看啊
Look at that.

347
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,210
记住这地方
Remember this place.

348
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,700
家园
Home.

349
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:27,960
哥哥
Brother.

350
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,550
这都怪你
This was your doing.

351
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,350
他死了啊
So he's gone.

352
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,330
真可惜  我还挺想看到那一幕的
That's a shame. I would've liked to have seen that.

353
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,440
你就是海拉吧
You must be Hela.

354
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,930
我是托尔  奥丁之子
I'm Thor, son of Odin.

355
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,190
是吗  你长得不像他
Really? You don't look like him.

356
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,330
或许我们可以商量一下
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.

357
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,190
你口气像他
You sound like him.

358
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,400
跪下
Kneel.

359
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,880
你说什么
Beg your pardon?

360
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,520
跪下
Kneel.

361
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,660
拜见你的女王
Before your queen.

362
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,290
别指望了
I don't think so.

363
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,020
不可能
It's not possible.

364
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:17,170
亲爱的  你根本想象不到我都能做什么
Darling, you have no idea what's possible.

365
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,500
带我们回去
Bring us back!

366
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,320
不
No!

367
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,680
洛基
Loki!

368
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,740
你是谁  你把托尔怎么了
Who are you? What have you done with Thor?

369
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,770
我是海拉
I'm Hela.

370
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,290
我就是个扫地的
I'm just a janitor.

371
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,900
你看上去像个求生本能强烈的机灵鬼
You look like a smart boy with good survival instincts.

372
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,910
想要份工作吗
How would you like a job?

373
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,620
你是个战士吗
Are you a fighter?

374
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,860
还是食物
Or are you food?

375
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,150
我就是路过
I'm just passing through.

376
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,270
是食物
It is food.

377
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,570
跪下
On your knees.

378
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,360
他是我的
He's mine.

379
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,910
等等
Wait!

380
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:22,860
等等
Wait!

381
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,470
他是我的
He's mine.

382
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,930
如果你们想要他  得过我这关
So if you want him, you go through me.

383
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,760
但我们已经得到他了
But we've already got him.

384
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,120
那好吧  我就先过你们这关
All right, then. I guess I go through you.

385
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,700
又来食物了
More food.

386
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,700
谢谢
Thank you.

387
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:53,280
拾荒者142号  我需要进门并觐见老大
Scrapper 142. I need clearance and an audience with the boss.

388
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,610
我带来了特别的东西
I've got something special.

389
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,130
你要带我去哪
Where are you taking me?

390
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,170
回答我
Answer me!

391
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,990
我是托尔  奥丁之子  我得回阿斯加德
I am Thor, son of Odin. I need to get back to Asgard.

392
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,200
非常抱歉  王子殿下
Many apologies, your majesty.

393
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,280
我发现  你们并不认识我
It's come to my attention that you don't know who I am.

394
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,380
我是海拉  奥丁的长女
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn,

395
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:54,110
阿斯加德大军的统帅
the commander of the Legions of Asgard,

396
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,710
王位的合法继承人  死亡女神
the rightful heir to the throne, and the Goddess of Death.

397
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,030
我父亲已死
My father is dead.

398
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,530
两位王子也是  不客气
As are the princes. You're welcome.

399
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,840
我们曾在宇宙中坐拥无上力量
We were once the seat of absolute power in the cosmos.

400
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,020
我们的地位无可匹及
Our supremacy was unchallenged.

401
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,410
但奥丁却止步于九大王国
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.

402
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,300
我们的命运是统治所有其他王国
Our destiny is to rule over all others.

403
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,240
我是来恢复那份权势的
And I am here to restore that power.

404
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,960
给我跪下
Kneel before me

405
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,970
加入我  与我一起踏上伟大的征途
and rise into the ranks of my great conquest.

406
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,150
不管你是谁
Whoever you are,

407
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,700
不管你做了什么  马上投降
whatever you've done, surrender now!

408
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,860
否则我们绝不留情
Or we will show you no mercy.

409
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,140
不管我是谁  我刚刚说话你听没听啊
Whoever I am? Did you listen to a word I said?

410
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,400
这是你最后的警告
This is your last warning!

411
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,830
我以为你们会乐意见到我呢
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

412
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,360
好吧
Fine.

413
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,380
进攻
Charge!

414
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,740
我真怀念这个
I've missed this.

415
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,760
不过  真是可惜
Still, it's a shame.

416
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,480
好战士白白枉死
Good soldiers dying for nothing,

417
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,740
就因为他们看不到未来
all because they couldn't see the future.

418
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,370
悲哀
Sad.

419
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,560
看  他还活着
Look, still alive.

420
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,580
改主意了吗
Change of heart?

421
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,270
滚回你爬出来的山洞去吧
Go back to whatever cave you crept out of.

422
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,650
你个女魔头
You evil demoness!

423
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,410
去看看我的王宫吧
Let's go see my palace.

424
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,220
别担心  你已被找到
Fear not, for you are found.

425
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,050
你到家了  再也回不去了
You are home, and there is no going back.

426
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,100
没人能离开此地
No one leaves this place.

427
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,050
但这里是什么地方
But what is this place?

428
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,270
这里是  萨卡
The answer is Sakaar.

429
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,330
被宇宙传送门环绕
Surrounded by cosmic gateways,

430
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,420
萨卡位于已知和未知世界的边缘
Sakaar lives on the edge of the known and unknown.

431
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,260
这里收集了所有迷失  不被爱的东西
It is the collection point for all lost and unloved things.

432
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,580
比如你
Like you.

433
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,900
但在萨卡  你是重要的
But here on Sakaar, you are significant.

434
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,230
你是有价值的
You are valuable.

435
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,270
你是被爱的
Here you are loved.

436
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,350
怎么回事
What the hell?

437
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,130
没人比宗师更爱你了
And no one loves you more than the Grandmaster.

438
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,870
他是最初的  第一个迷失  第一个被找到的人
He is the original, the first lost and the first found.

439
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,520
萨卡的创始人
The creator of Sakaar,

440
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,960
冠军格斗之父
and father of the Contest of Champions.

441
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,380
虽然你曾经一文不名  但现在你有了身份
Where once you were nothing, now you are something.

442
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,630
你是宗师的财产
You are the property of the Grandmaster.

443
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,990
恭喜
Congratulations!

444
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:14,340
你将在5秒后见到宗师
You will meet the Grandmaster in five seconds.

445
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,280
准备好
Prepare yourself.

446
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,430
准备好
Prepare yourself.

447
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,330
你将见到宗师
You are now meeting the Grandmaster.

448
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,420
他真棒  是个"他"吧
He's wonderful. It is a he?

449
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,780
是的
It is a he.

450
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,960
嗯
Yeah.

451
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,320
我就喜欢你过来  142
I love when you come to visit, 142.

452
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,160
你总给我带最好的东西来
You bring me the best stuff.

453
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,860
托佩兹  每次我们聊起拾荒者142号
Whenever we get to talking, Topaz, about Scrapper 142,

454
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,620
我都怎么说  "她是..."  B开头的词
what do I always say? "She is the..." And it starts with a "B."

455
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,650
垃圾
Trash.

456
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,590
不  不是垃圾
No, not trash.

457
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,710
你是就等着那么说她吗
Were you waiting just to call her that?

458
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,150
都不是B开头的词
It doesn't start with a "B."

459
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,510
酒鬼婆娘
Booze hag.

460
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,450
抱歉  不是  "最好的"
I'm so sorry. No, "Best."

461
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,870
我是想说"最好的"
I was thinking about "Best."

462
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,200
因为我总说你是最好的
'Cause I always say you're the best.

463
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,110
她为我带来了我的格斗冠军呢
She brought me my beloved champion, you know.

464
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,090
每次她来你都这么说
You say that every time she's here.

告诉她那是做梦

476
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,340
老天  给她钱吧

477
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,870
你会付出代价的

478
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,690
不  是别人付我钱
No, I got paid for this.

我想知道的是
Here's what I wanna know.

你是谁
Who are you?

481
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:13,570
我是雷神
I am the God of Thunder.

482

我没听到雷声
I didn't hear any thunder,

483
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,620
但你手上的是电火花吗

天呐
Oh, my God!

502
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,890
流到我脚下了  看啊
I'm stepping in it. I'm stepping in it. Look!

503
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,790
好臭
The smell.

504
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,280
这是什么味儿
What does it smell like?

505
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,520
烤焦的吐司
Burnt toast.

506
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,140
我怎么这么没礼貌
What happened to my manners?

507
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,440
我还没好好自我介绍呢
I haven't properly introduced myself.

508
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,460
来吧  跟我来
Come on. Follow me.

509
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,300
我叫宗师
My name is Grandmaster.

510

我主持一项
I preside over a little

511
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,520
滑稽表演  叫做冠军格斗
harlequinade called the Contest of Champions.

512
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,460
来自各处的人  都会不情愿地参与其中
People come from far and wide to unwillingly participate in it.

513
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,330
而你  我的朋友  可以加入新卡司
And you, my friend, might just be part of the new cast.

514
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,270
怎么样
What do you say to that?

515
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,510
我们不是朋友  我也不在乎你的游戏
We're not friends and I don't give a shit about your games.

516
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,260
我要回阿斯加德
I'm going back to Asgard.

517
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,480
阿屎加德
Ass-gard.

518
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,110
一  二  三  四
One, two, three, four.

519
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,920
我下方有个时间空间的虫洞
There was a wormhole in space and time beneath me.

520
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,930
于是  我放手了
At that moment, I let go.

521
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,050
洛基
Loki?

522
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:49,360
洛基
Loki! Loki!

523
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,600
过来
Over here. Over here.

524
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,680
-失陪一下  -洛基
- Excuse me one second. - Loki!

525
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,560
-干什么  -你还活着
- What? - You're alive?

526
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,590
-我当然还活着  -你怎么来了
- Yes, of course I'm alive. - What are you doing here?

527
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,260
这话什么意思
What do you mean, what am I doing?

528
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,840
我被困在这张破椅子上了
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.

529
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,370
-你怎么没坐椅子  -没人让我坐椅子
- Where's your chair? - I didn't get a chair.

530
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,690
-帮我从这椅子上起来  -不行
- Get me out of this one. - I can't.

531
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,820
-帮我起来  -不行
- Get me out. - I can't.

532
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,510
什么
What?

533
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,100
我跟那个宗师交了朋友
I've made friends with this man. He's called the Grandmaster.

534
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,030
-他是个疯子  -我赢得了他的好感
- He's crazy! - I've gained his favor.

535
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,650
彩虹桥几周前把我丢到了这里
The Bifrost brought me out here weeks ago.

536
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,780
-几周前  -是啊
- Weeks ago? - Yes.

537
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,950
我才刚到
I just got here.

538
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,250
你们在小声说什么呢
What are you whispering about?

539
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,240
这里的时间规律很不一样
Time works real different around these parts.

540
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,360
在别的世界上  我都该几百万岁了
On any other world, I'd be, like, millions of years old.

541
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,510
但在萨卡上
But here on Sakaar...

542
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:31,410
不管怎样  你认识这个...
In any case, you know this...

543
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,720
你称自己为雷王是吧
You call yourself Lord of Thunder?

544
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,190
雷神  告诉他
God of Thunder. Tell him.

545
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:37,180
我这辈子从未见过这个人
I've never met this man in my life.

546
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,860
-他是我弟弟  -领养的
- He's my brother. - Adopted.

547
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,230
他能不能打
Is he any kind of a fighter?

548
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,180
你把我脖子上的东西拿走  我就打给你看看
You take this thing out of my neck and I'll show you.

549
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,260
瞧瞧  他在威胁我呢
Now, listen to that. He's threatening me.

550
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,130
小火花  事情是这样的
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.

551
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:48,710
如果你想回到那个二死堡还是什么的地方
If you wanna get back to Ass-place, Assberg...

552
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,730
阿斯加德
Asgard.

553
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:52,930
任何参赛者  只要能打败我的冠军
Any contender who defeats my champion,

554
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,140
就能赢得自由
their freedom they shall win.

555
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,590
好啊  那就给我指个路
Fine. Then point me in the direction

556
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,330
要我去揍的人在哪里
of whoever's ass I have to kick!

557
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,050
这才是我的参赛者
That's what I call, contender.

558
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:03,650
这边走  大王
Direction would be this way, Lord.

559
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,330
洛基
Loki!

560
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,420
放松点  哥们
Take it easy, man.

561
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:15,570
这边呢
Over here.

562
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,700
向你招手的一堆石头
The pile of rocks waving at you. Here.

563
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,020
是的  我其实是有生命的
Yeah, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being.

564
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,330
请允许我做个自我介绍
Allow me to introduce myself.

565
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:23,790
我叫寇格  我算是这里的领导吧
My name is Korg. I'm kind of like the leader in here.

566
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,490
你也能看出来  我是石头做的
I'm made of rocks, as you can see.

567
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,360
但不要被我的外表吓到
But don't let that intimidate you.

568
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,940
你不用害怕  除非你是剪刀做的
You don't need to be afraid unless you're made of scissors.

569
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:32,630
就是跟你开个石头剪刀布的小玩笑
Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke for you.

570
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,810
这是我的好朋友  米克
This is my very good friend over here, Miek.

571
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,320
他是只有剪刀手的昆虫
He's an insect and has knives for hands.

572
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,710
你是克努南人  对吗
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

573
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,080
-没错  -你怎么会落到这里
- That I am. - How'd you end up in here?

574
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,410
我试图发动革命来着
Well, I tried to start a revolution,

575
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,950
但没做好宣传工作
but didn't print enough pamphlets.

576
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,580
所以几乎没人参加
So hardly anyone turned up,

577
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,910
除了我妈妈和她那讨厌的男朋友
except for my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate.

578
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,530
作为惩罚  我被迫来到这里做个角斗士
As punishment, I was forced to be in here and become a gladiator.

579
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,540
简直是个宣传灾难
Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.

580
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:59,520
但我其实在策划另一场革命
But I'm actually organizing another revolution.

581
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,580
我不知道你是不是感兴趣
I don't know if you'd be interested in something like that.

582
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,070
你觉得怎么样
Do you reckon you'd be interested?

583
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,930
你怎么会...
How did you...

584
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,610
是啊  这个地方其实是个圈
Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle.

585
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,880
但不是真正的圈  更像是个恐怖怪圈
But not a real circle, more like a freaky circle.

586
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,320
这没道理
This doesn't make any sense.

587
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,910
是啊  这里就是不讲道理的
No, nothing makes sense here, man.

588
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:19,130
没道理就是这里的道理
The only thing that does make sense is that nothing makes sense.

589
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,650
这里有人跟宗师的冠军打过吗
Has anyone here fought the Grandmaster's champion?

590
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:22,710
道格打过
Doug has.

591
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,600
道格
Doug!

592
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,390
这就是命  道格已经死了
Our luck, Doug's dead.

593
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:28,900
对了  跟宗师的冠军打过的人都死掉了
That's right. Everyone who fights the Grandmaster's champion perishes.

594
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,650
你呢  你是石头做的
What about you? You're made of rocks.

595
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,680
会死掉的石头  看啊  又掉一块
Perishable rock. There you go. Another one gone.

596
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,450
我只是小打小闹
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights,

597
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,180
暖暖场之类的
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

598
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,510
等等  你不是要去跟他打吧
Wait. You're not gonna face him, are you?

599
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,550
没错
Yes, I am.

600
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,630
我要跟他打  打赢他  然后离开这鬼地方
Gonna fight him, win, and get the hell out of this place.

601
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,010
道格以前就这么说
That's exactly what Doug used to say.

602
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,890
回见  新道格
See you later, new Doug.

603
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,650
没人记得我吗
Does no one remember me?

604
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:03,470
没人学过我们的历史吗
Has no one been taught our history?

605
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,860
看看这些谎言
Look at these lies.

606
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:13,600
高脚杯  花园聚会
Goblets and garden parties?

607
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,580
和平协议
Peace treaties?

608
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:18,450
奥丁...
Odin...

609
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,330
为成果骄傲
Proud to have it,

610
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:22,520
却觉得手段可耻
ashamed of how he got it.

611
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,200
我们曾势不可挡
We were unstoppable.

612
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,930
在扩张阿斯加德帝国时  我曾是他的武器
I was his weapon in the conquest that built Asgard's empire.

613
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:54,410
我们征服了一个又一个王国
One by one, the realms became ours.

614
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:59,010
然后  就因为我的野心比他更大
But then, simply because my ambition outgrew his,

615
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,480
他就将我放逐  囚禁
he banished me, caged me,

616
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,640
像只野兽一样把我锁了起来
locked me away like an animal.

617
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:06,960
在那之前  阿斯加德的战士是受尊敬的
Before that, Asgard's warriors were honored,

618
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,460
他们的遗体像英雄那样葬在这宫殿下面
their bodies buried as heroes beneath this very palace.

619
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,220
-奥丁的宝藏  -赝品
- Odin's treasures. - Fake.

620
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:27,940
这里大部分的东西都是赝品
Most of the stuff in here is fake.

621
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:29,840
或者没用
Or weak.

622
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,760
比我以为的要小
Smaller than I thought it would be.

623
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,540
这个还可以
That's not bad.

624
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,400
但是这个...
But this...

625
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,290
永恒烈火
The Eternal Flame.

626
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,010
想看看真正的力量是什么样子吗
Want to see what true power really looks like?

627
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:43,280
亲爱的芬里斯  他们对你做了什么
Fenris, my darling, what have they done to you?

628
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,240
永恒烈火将让你们重生
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

629
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,940
我好想你
I've missed you.

630
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:09,490
我想念你们大家
I've missed you all.

631
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,420
奥丁
Odin,

632
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:17,200
我愿你升入英灵殿
I bid you take your place in the halls of Valhalla,

633
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,480
勇者将在那里永生
where the brave shall live forever.

634
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,580
我们应该高兴而不是哀伤
Nor shall we mourn but rejoice,

635
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,900
因为他们死得光荣
for those that have died the glorious death.

636
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,860
扎心  对吗
Hurts, doesn't it?

637
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:37,430
被欺骗的感觉
Being lied to.

638
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,970
告诉你是一回事  然后你发现那都是假的
Being told you're one thing and then learning it's all a fiction.

639
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:48,400
你不会以为我真的会来这里见你吧
You didn't think I'd really come and see you, did you?

640
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,990
这地方太恶心了
This place is disgusting.

641
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,150
你是不想要我帮忙吗
Does this mean you don't want my help?

642
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:57,450
我不能失去我在宗师身边的地位
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position with the Grandmaster.

643
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:58,940
我为赢得他的信任很费心力
It took me time to win his trust.

644
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,540
他是个疯子  但也是有办法应付的
He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable.

645
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,870
我是想告诉你
What I'm telling you is,

646
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:03,930
你可以跟我一起服侍宗师
you could join me at the Grandmaster's side.

647
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:08,700
也许将来  宗师会出事  然后...
Perhaps, in time, an accident befalls the Grandmaster, and then...

648
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,270
你不是真在考虑回去吧
You're not seriously thinking of going back, are you?

649
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:23,810
我们姐姐像砸玻璃一样轻松毁了你的锤子
Our sister destroyed your hammer like a piece of glass.

650
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,470
她比我们都强  她比你强
She's stronger than both of us. She's stronger than you.

651
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:27,880
你一丝机会都没有
You don't stand a chance.

652
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,850
你明白我什么意思吗
Do you understand what I'm saying here?

653
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,540
好吧
Fine.

654
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,530
那我得单干了
I guess I'll just have to go it alone.

655
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,370
一如既往
Like I've always done.

656
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,020
你能不能说点什么
Would you say something?

657
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,960
说话啊
Say something!

658
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,030
你要我说什么
What would you like me to say?

659
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:57,020
你装死
You faked your own death,

660
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,010
偷了王位  剥夺了奥丁的法力
you stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power,

661
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,580
把他留在地球上等死  放出了死亡女神
stranded him on Earth to die, releasing the Goddess of Death.

662
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,430
这些够不够
Have I said enough

663
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:07,380
还是你要我继续翻两天之前的旧账
or would you like me to go back further than the past two days?

664
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:12,660
我还没见过他口中这个宠儿冠军
You know, I haven't seen this beloved champion he talks of,

665
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,040
但听说他野蛮得吓人
but I've heard he is astonishingly savage.

666
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,880
明天的格斗  我下了很大的注压你输
I've placed a large wager against you tomorrow.

667
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,480
别让我失望
Don't let me down.

668
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,660
滚开  鬼
Piss off, ghost!

669
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,470
他消失了
He's freaking gone.

670
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,490
恶心
Yuck!

671
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:41,720
这上面还留着不知谁的毛发和血
There's still someone's hair and blood all over this.

672
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,710
伙计们  格斗完能不能清理下武器啊
Guys, can you clean up the weapons once you finish your fight?

673
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:46,290
恶心的懒蛋
Disgusting slobs.

674
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:50,300
托尔  用大木叉子吗
Thor, wanna use a big wooden fork?

675
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:51,890
不了
No.

676
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:53,300
是啊  不太实用
Yeah, not really useful.

677
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,340
除非你要打挤成一团的
Unless you're fighting off three vampires

678
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,810
三个吸血鬼
that were huddled together.

679
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,380
真希望我的锤子还在
I really wish I had my hammer.

680
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:00,570
锤子
Hammer?

681
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:01,350
很特别
Quite unique.

682
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:05,100
是用濒死星球内核的特别金属制成
It was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star.

683
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,520
我快速抡它
And when I spun it really, really fast,

684
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,020
就能飞起来
it gave me the ability to fly.

685
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,170
你骑在锤子上
You rode a hammer?

686
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,970
不  不是骑在上面
No, I didn't ride the hammer.

687
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:12,180
它骑在你背上
The hammer rode you on your back?

688
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,450
不  我快速抡它
No. I used to spin it really fast,

689
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:16,030
它就会把我带起来...
and it would pull me off the...

690
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:18,260
天啊  锤子给你撸吗
Oh, my God. A hammer pulled you off?

691
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,900
把我带离地面  它会带我离开地面
The ground. It would pull me off the ground,

692
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,920
带我升入空中  我就能飞了
up into the air, and I would fly.

693
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,260
我把它扔出去  它总能回到我手中
Every time I threw it, it would always come back to me.

694
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:27,610
你和这把锤子的关系好像很特殊
Sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship

695
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:28,260
很亲密
with this hammer

696
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,600
失去它堪比失去爱人
and that losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one.

697
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:33,530
这么说挺温馨的
That's a nice way of putting it.

698
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:37,420
我说了这些是我的
I said they're mine.

699
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:41,210
看  就是她把我抓来的
See her, that's the one that put me in here.

700
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,240
是啊  拾荒者142号
Yeah. Scrapper 142.

701
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,380
要小心这些阿斯加德人
Gotta watch out for those Asgardians, man.

702
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,970
命硬得很
They are hard to perish.

703
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:48,470
阿斯加德人
Asgardian?

704
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:57,630
别用那玩意电我  我有话要说
Do not zap me with that thing. I just wanna talk.

705
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:00,300
阿斯加德有危险了
Asgard is in danger.

706
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:06,250
天啊  你是女武神
My God, you're a Valkyrie.

707
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,410
我小时候还想当女武神
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was younger,

708
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:11,890
但之后我发现你们都是女的
until I found out that you were all women.

709
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:14,410
是女的没什么不好  我爱女人
There's nothing wrong with women, of course. I love women.

710
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,940
有时太爱了
Sometimes a little too much.

711
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:19,330
不是猥琐的那种  是尊重的欣赏
Not in a creepy way, just more of a respectful appreciation.

712
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:23,640
能有一支女武士组成的精英部队真的很不错
I think it's great that there is an elite force of women warriors.

713
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,980
是时候了
It's about time.

714
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,000
-你说完没  -雷王  该你了
- Are you done? - Lord of Thunder, you're up.

715
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,600
求你  帮帮我  我需要你的帮助
Please, help me. I need your help.

716
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,290
再见
Bye.

717
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,570
好吧  那你不是叛徒就是懦夫
Fine, then you must be a traitor or a coward.

718
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:35,810
因为女武神都发过誓要保卫王权
Because the Valkyrie is sworn to protect the throne.

719
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,420
听仔细了  殿下  这是萨卡  不是阿斯加德
Listen closely, your majesty. This is Sakaar, not Asgard.

720
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,230
我是拾荒者  不是女武神
And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.

721
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:47,350
带他过来收拾一下
Bring him in for processing.

722
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:51,750
没人能逃出这里  所以你反正也是个死
And no one escapes this place. So you're gonna die anyway.

723
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,690
你别动
Now, don't you move.

724
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,790
我的手不如以前稳了
My hands ain't as steady as they used to be.

725
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:11,110
以奥丁的胡子起誓  你不准剪我的头发
By Odin's beard, you shall not cut my hair,

726
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:14,110
不然就会尝到托尔之怒的滋味
lest you feel the wrath of the mighty Thor.

727
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:20,480
求你了  求你了  好心人  别剪我头发
Please. Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair.

728
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:23,090
求你  不要
Please! No!

729
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,910
不
No!

730
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,130
看看你们  今晚比赛多么精彩
Look at all of you. What a show! What a night!

731
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,160
谁觉得开心
Who's having fun?

732
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,180
我是你们的主持人
Please, I'm your host.

733
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,550
请掌声感谢所有赛前战的格斗者
Big round of applause for all of our undercard competitors,

734
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:51,780
他们今天死得真可怕
who today died so gruesomely.

735
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,950
比赛真棒
Good sports.

736
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:54,950
今晚比赛多么精彩
What a show! What a night!

737
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,050
我们都是为格斗而来的
This is what you've come for, and so have I.

738
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,100
现在  不再耽搁
And now, without further ado,

739
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,060
压轴比赛开始了
it's main event time.

740
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:15,640
虽是首次登场  但却很有潜力
Making his first appearance, though he looks quite promising,

741
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:17,760
有点绝招
got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.

742
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,470
我不再多说了  你们来自己判断
I'll say no more, see what you think.

743
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:22,600
女士们先生们  有请
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...

744
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,000
雷王
Lord of Thunder.

745
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:51,060
小心他的手指  会放火花
Watch out for his fingers. They make sparks.

746
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,790
好了  来吧
Okay, this is it.

747
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:56,320
我们准备欢迎这家伙吧  他来咯
Let's get ready to welcome this guy. Here he comes.

748
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,150
他这个家伙
He is a creature.

749
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,920
我们要怎么说呢
What can we say about him?

750
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,560
他很特别  独一无二
Well, he's unique. There's none like him.

751
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,920
我觉得跟他有特别的感情
I feel a special connection with him.

752
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,330
他从未有败绩
He's undefeated.

753
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,740
是连胜者
He's the reigning.

754
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:22,810
是卫冕方
He's the defending.

755
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:25,250
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen...

756
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:26,450
有请
I give you...

757
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:35,440
无敌的
Your Incredible...

758
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:40,980
绿巨人
Hulk!

759
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:42,830
太好了
Yes!

760
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:48,140
我得离开这个星球
I have to get off this planet.

761
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,090
你想去哪啊
Where you going?

762
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:02,510
我俩认识
We know each other.

763
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:04,290
他是我战友
He's a friend from work.

764
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,200
你去哪了
Where have you been?

765
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:17,350
大家都以为你死了
Everybody thought you were dead.

766
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,760
我们上次一别后发生了好多事
But so much has happened since I last saw you.

767
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,790
我失去了锤子
I lost my hammer.

768
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:25,150
就昨天  还记忆犹新的
Like, yesterday, so that's still pretty fresh.

769
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,520
洛基还活着  相信吗
Loki. Loki's alive. Can you believe it?

770
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,820
他就在上面
He's up there.

771
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,030
洛基  看这是谁
Loki! Look who it is!

772
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,690
班纳  真没想到我会这么说
Banner, I never thought I would say this,

773
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,620
但我见到你可真高兴
but I'm happy to see you.

774
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:40,000
绿巨人  绿巨人
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

775
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:47,580
班纳
Banner.

776
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:49,580
班纳
Banner!

777
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,570
不是班纳  只有绿巨人
No Banner. Only Hulk.

778
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,590
你在干什么
What are you doing?

779
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:56,040
是我啊  托尔
It's me. It's Thor!

780
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,460
班纳  我们是朋友啊

781
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:19,370
这真是疯了  我不想伤你
This is crazy. I don't want to hurt you!

782
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,620
这就对了  这才像话
Here we go. Here we go.

783
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,200
什么
What?

784
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,120
大块头
Hey, big guy.

785
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:03,990
太阳快下山了
The sun's getting real low.

786
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,210
没错  太阳要下山了
That's it. The sun's going down.

787
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,070
我不会再伤害你了
I won't hurt you anymore.

788

没人会伤害你了
No one will.

789
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,290
没错
Yes!

790
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,070
就是这感觉
That's how it feels!

791
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,580
我就是太喜欢这项运动了
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.

792
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,390
好吧  不管了
All right. Screw it.

793
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,700
我知道你还在的  班纳
I know you're in there, Banner.

794
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,900
我会把你逼出来的
I'll get you out!

795
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,950
你是怎么了  真让我下不来台
What's the matter with you? You're embarrassing me!

796
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:18,840
我还跟他们说我们是朋友
I told them we were friends!

797
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:54,340
雷哥  雷哥
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

798
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:59,460
雷哥  雷哥
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

799
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,990
又一天  又一个道格
Another day, another Doug.

800
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,510
那是什么声音
What is that noise?

801
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,860
民众并没有乖乖听话
The common folk aren't exactly falling in line.

802
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:51,330
有抵抗者想撞倒大门
There's a resistance trying to knock down the front gates.

803
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,880
说说你自己吧  斯科尔奇
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.

804
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,770
我爸是个石匠  我妈是...
Well, me dad was a stonemason. Me mum was...

805
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:05,710
嗯  打住吧  我的意思是
Right, yeah, I'll just stop you there. What I meant was,

806
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:07,150
你的野心是什么
what's your ambition?

807
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,940
我只想要个机会证明自己
I just want a chance to prove myself.

808
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,660
承认
Recognition.

809
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:15,620
我年轻时
When I was young,

810
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,920
每位伟大国王都有个处刑人
every great king had an executioner.

811
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:21,520
不仅仅是进行处刑
Not just to execute people,

812
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,800
也执行国王的愿景
but also to execute their vision.

813
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:28,120
但主要还是做处刑的
But mainly to execute people.

814
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,110
但  这仍是无上光荣
Still, it was a great honor.

815
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,440
我曾是奥丁的处刑人
I was Odin's executioner.

816
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:40,310
你就做我的处刑人
And you shall be my executioner.

817
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,500
我们开始征程吧
Let's begin our conquest.

818
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,770
斯科尔奇  剑呢
Skurge, where's the sword?

819
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,620
那把剑是打开彩虹桥的钥匙
That sword is the key to opening the Bifrost.

820
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,610
你提到的那些人
Those people you mentioned,

821
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:13,590
那些不肯乖乖就范的
the ones who aren't falling into line...

822
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:15,440
把他们都抓起来
Round them up.

823
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:40,400
借过
Excuse me.

824
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:56,030
抱歉了  那些玩意到处都是
Sorry about that. These bloody things are everywhere.

825
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:57,650
走吧
Come on.

826
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:34,200
你们在这里是安全的
You'll be safe here.

827
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:45,330
我们没事了吧
Are we cool?

828
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:50,530
绿巨人洗热浴盆
It's Hulk in a hot tub.

829
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,520
你这样多久了
So how long have you been like that?

830
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,230
什么样
Like what?

831
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,050
这样  大块头  绿色的  呆头呆脑
Like this. Big, and green, and stupid.

832
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:02,140
绿巨人一直是绿巨人
Hulk always Hulk.

833
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:08,120
你怎么到这儿的
How'd you get here?

834
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:10,190
靠赢
Winning.

835
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:11,610
你是说作弊吧
You mean cheating?

836
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:14,110
你赢的时候  对手也都有这玩意吗
Were they wearing one of these when you won?

837
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,800
你怎么来到这儿的
How'd you arrive here?

838
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:19,760
昆式战斗机
Quinjet.

839
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,020
很好  那架昆式战斗机现在在哪
Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?

840
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,570
你没穿衣服
That's naked.

841
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:30,980
他没穿衣服
He's very naked.

842
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:37,100
这下忘不掉了
It's in my brain now.

843
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:39,260
昆式战斗机
Quinjet.

844
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,990
太好了
Yes!

845
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:52,200
我要带咱们离开
I'm getting us out of here.

846
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:55,090
这个糟糕的地方
This terrible, awful place.

847
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:56,790
你会喜欢阿斯加德的
You're gonna love Asgard.

848
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:59,440
很大  还金闪闪的
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.

849
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,580
绿巨人不走
Hulk stay.

850
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:04,270
不不  我的人民需要我回阿斯加德
No, no, no. My people need me to get back to Asgard.

851
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:06,920
我们得阻止诸神黄昏
We must prevent Ragnarok.

852
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,220
诸神黄昏
Ragnarok?

853
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:10,130
我家园的毁灭预言
The prophesied death of my home world.

854
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:12,220
世界末日  一切终结
The end of days, it's the end of...

855
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:15,960
如果你帮我回阿斯加德
If you help me get back to Asgard,

856
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:17,950
我可以帮你回地球

地球爱绿巨人  他们爱死你了

01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,610
你是复仇者联盟成员  我们的队友  朋友
You're one of the Avengers. One of the team, one of our friends.

860
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:26,470
朋友就该如此  彼此支持
This is what friends do. They support each other.

861
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:27,970
你是班纳的朋友
You're Banner's friend.

862
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:30,200
我才不是班纳的朋友  我更喜欢你
I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.

863
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,240
班纳的朋友
Banner's friend.

864
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,600
我都不喜欢班纳
I don't even like Banner.

865
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:35,060
"我喜欢数字  科学什么的"
"I'm into numbers and science and stuff."

866
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:37,660
托尔走  绿巨人留下
Thor go. Hulk stay.

867
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:38,340

留下吧
Stay here.

869
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:43,500
破地方  难看死了
Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way.

870
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:47,460
又是红  又是白  选个颜色吧  真荒唐
The red, the white. Just pick a color. Ridiculous.

871
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,300
砸扁你
Smash you.

872
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:51,710
你才没砸扁什么  那场角斗我赢了
You didn't smash anything. I won that fight.

873
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:54,130
-我砸扁了你  -好吧
- I smashed you. - Yeah, sure, sure.

874

875
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:56,920
小个子
Baby.

876

获胜
Winning.

886
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:45,020
海姆达尔  我知道你看得到我

887
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:49,170
我需要你帮我
I need you to help me.

888
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:52,050
帮我看到
Help me see.

889
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,440
我看得到你  但你在很远的地方
I see you, but you're far away.

890
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:06,800
这里怎么回事
What's going on here?

891
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:08,210
自己来看吧
Come see for yourself.

892
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:14,340
我在祖先建造的要塞里庇护大家
I'm providing refuge in a stronghold built by our ancestors.

893
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:17,730
但如果抵挡不住  我们只能靠彩虹桥逃跑
But if the garrison falls, our only escape is Bifrost.

894
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:19,690
你想要疏散整个阿斯加德
You're talking about evacuating Asgard?

895
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:24,600
如果留下我们都活不久
We won't last long if we stay.

她汲取阿斯加德的力量  每天都更强大

897
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:28,830
走吧
Come on.

898
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,770
海拉很贪婪
Hela is ravenous.

899
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:35,970
如果我放走了她
If I let her leave,

900
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:38,290
她会吞噬整个九大王国甚至宇宙
she'll consume Nine Realms and all the cosmos.

901
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,120
我们需要你
We need you.

902
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,490
我在想办法了  但我都不知道自己在哪
I'm working on it. But I don't even know where the hell I am.

903
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:44,220
你所在的星球周围都是传送门  穿过其中一个
You're on a planet surrounded by doorways. Go through one.

904
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:45,980
-哪个  -大的那个
- Which one? - The big one.

905
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:16,780
托尔难过

908
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:25,020
我不难过  你个白痴
I'm not sad, you idiot.

909
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:26,370
我在生气
I'm pissed off!

910
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,880
愤怒  我失去了父亲
Angry. I lost my father.

911
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,290
我失去了锤子
I lost my hammer.

912
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:37,380
-唧唧歪歪  像个孩子  -你都没认真听
- Whining and crying. Cry like baby. - You're not even listening.

913
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,370
别踢东西
Don't kick stuff.

914
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,870
你真不够朋友
You're being a really bad friend.

915
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:44,230
你才不够朋友
You bad friend!

916
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:45,200
-你知道我们怎么喊你吗  -不知道
- You know what we call you? - No.

917
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,490
我们喊你蠢复仇者
We call you the stupid Avenger.

918
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,500
你是小复仇者
You're tiny Avenger!

919
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:53,440
你疯了吗
What, are you crazy?

920
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,310
是啊
Yes.

921
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:57,460
知道吗  地球是恨你
You know what? Earth does hate you.

922

不要
No.

923
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,060
很抱歉我说了那些话
I'm sorry I said those things.

924
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,740
你不是蠢复仇者
You're not the stupid Avenger.

925
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:29,100
没人喊你蠢复仇者
Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.

926
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:30,760
没事
It's okay.

927
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:33,290
你不能随便冲人仍盾牌
You just can't go around throwing shields at people.

928
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:33,960
差点杀了我
Could have killed me.

929
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,930
我知道  对不起  我总是好生气
I know. I'm sorry. I just get so angry all the time.

930
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:39,170
绿巨人总是很生气
Hulk always, always angry.

931
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:41,200
我知道  我们是一样的
I know. We're the same, you and I.

932
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,830
我们就是俩鲁莽的傻瓜
We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.

933
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:47,920
是啊  一样  绿巨人是火  托尔是水
Yeah, same. Hulk like fire, Thor like water.

934
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,600
我们都是火
We're kind of both like fire.

935
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,590
但绿巨人是真火
But Hulk like real fire.

936
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:56,130
绿巨人是烈火
Hulk like raging fire.

937
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:58,790
托尔是阴燃火
Thor like smoldering fire.

938
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:02,670
绿巨人  我需要你帮我个忙
Hulk, I need you to do something for me.

939
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:10,650
生气姑娘
Angry girl.

940
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:20,160
怎么了  你...
What's going on? What are you...

941
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:31,270
你就蠢到看不出
You're so thick-headed that you can't tell

942
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:33,190
人家远远躲到了宇宙尽头
when someone's hiding all the way across the universe

943
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:34,450
就是不想被打扰吗
and wants to be left alone?

944
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:37,320
-我们得谈谈  -不  你想跟我谈
- We need to talk. - No, you wanna talk to me.

945
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:38,930
我需要她留下
I need her to stay.

946
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:39,720
留下
Stay?

947
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:41,660
挡住
Block.

948
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:44,640
留下
Stay.

949
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,010
-拜托  -拜托
- Please. - Please.

950
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:50,810
好吧
All right.

951
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:53,940
这样吧
Here's the deal.

952
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:56,410
我听你说
I'll listen to you

953
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,180
喝光这个我就走
till this is empty.

954
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:02,850
阿斯加德有危险  人民在牺牲
Asgard is in danger and people are dying.

955
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:04,900
我们得回去  我需要你帮忙
We need to get back there. I need your help.

956
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:08,620
喝完了  再见
Finished. Bye.

957
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:11,500
奥丁死了
Odin is dead.

958
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:17,340
死亡女神海拉  入侵了阿斯加德
Hela, the Goddess of Death, has invaded Asgard.

959
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,430
如果海拉回来了  那阿斯加德无望了
If Hela's back, then Asgard's already lost.

960
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:21,990
我要阻止她
I'm going to stop her.

961
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:23,990
-一个人吗  -不
- Alone? - Nope.

962
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:25,630
我在组建一支队伍
I'm putting together a team.

963
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:28,500
我  你还有大块头
It's me, you, and the big guy.

964
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:31,240
不  不组队  绿巨人单干
No. No team. Only Hulk.

965
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,100
我和你
It's me and you.

966
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:34,310
我看是只有你
I think it's only you.

967
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:36,740
求你  听我说  女武神都是传奇
Please, listen. The Valkyrie are legend.

968
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:39,590
阿斯加德的精英武士  发誓保护王权
Elite warriors of Asgard sworn to defend the throne.

969
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:40,660
我不要再次
I'm not getting dragged

970
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:42,780
被卷入奥丁的家庭纠纷当中
into another one of Odin's family squabbles.

971
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,580
-这话什么意思  -你姐姐
- What's that supposed to mean? - Your sister.

972
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:46,670
她的力量来自阿斯加德  你也是
Her power comes from Asgard, same as yours.

973
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:48,110
当奥丁无法控制她的力量
When it grew beyond Odin's control

974
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:49,630
她就屠杀了王宫里的每个人
she massacred everyone in the palace

975
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:51,130
企图夺取王位
and tried to seize the throne.

976
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:52,980
她企图逃离驱逐时
When she tried to escape her banishment

977
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,130
他派女武神去抵抗她
he sent the Valkyrie in to fight her back.

978
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,380
我能生还只是因为
I only survived because...

979
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,910
我已经迎战过她一次了
Look, I already faced her once

980
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:03,650
那是我还相信王权的时候
back when I believed in the throne,

981
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,450
而我失去了一切
and it cost me everything.

982
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:07,180
这就是阿斯加德的问题
That's what's wrong with Asgard.

983
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:09,890
王权  秘密  金色的骗局
The throne, the secrets, the whole golden sham.

984
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:10,960
我同意
I agree.

985
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,620
别太亲近了
Don't get familiar.

986
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:15,180
我同意
I agree.

987
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,330
所以我拒绝了王位
That's why I turned down the throne.

988
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:20,360
但关键不在于王位  而是人民
But this isn't about the crown. This is about the people.

989
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,730
他们要死了  他们也是你的人民
They're dying and they're your people, too.

990
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:23,660
忘了他们吧
Forget it.

991
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:25,950
我就做到了
I have.

992
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:27,620
-好吧  -好
- Okay. - Okay.

993
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:29,210

谢谢
Thank you.

995
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:31,750
-谢什么  -这个
- For what? - For this.

996
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:35,650
你没看到吧
Didn't see that, did you?

997
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:39,470
那么...这下好多了
There... That's better.

998
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,500
随你吧
You know, go ahead.

999
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:47,000
留下  为那个疯子奴役他人
Stay here and enslave people for that lunatic.

1000
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:48,820
继续喝酒  躲藏
Keep drinking, keep hiding.

1001
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:49,790
但我
But me...

1002
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:55,440
我会冲向我的麻烦  而不是逃避它们
I choose to run toward my problems and not away from them.

1003
01:12:56,570 --> 01:12:57,640
因为...
Because that's what...

1004
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:04,400
因为  英雄都会这么做
Because that's what heroes do.

1005
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:17,850
朋友留下
Friend stay!

1006
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:30,570

所以  你得驾驶飞机返航

恐怕是的
I'm afraid so.

1058
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:08,430
发生了什么事啊
What the hell happened?

1059
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,440

01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:58,190
就是如此
Well, it's true.

1077
01:16:58,190 --> 01:17:00,300
看来那个诱拐犯
It seems that that criminally seductive

1078
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:03,120
雷王把他偷走了
Lord of Thunder has stolen him away.

1079
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,930
是诱拐犯雷神  我们得走了
Seductive God of Thunder. We need to move.

1080
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:07,700
糟糕
Oh, no.

1081
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:10,280
这太糟了
This is bad.

1082
01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:12,690
这太糟糕了
This is really, really bad.

1083
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:18,960
托尔  我在抓狂
Thor, I think I'm freaking out.

1084
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,510
别别
No, no, no.

1085
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:22,780
别抓狂  你没事的  穿上这个
Don't freak out. You're okay. Put these on.

1086
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:23,650
这是托尼的衣服
These are Tony's clothes.

1087
01:17:23,650 --> 01:17:25,020
-我知道  穿吧  -他也在吗
- I know, come on. - Is he here?

1088
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:27,170
不  他没在  听着  保持冷静
No, he's not here. But listen. Just stay calm, okay?

1089
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:28,230
太阳快下山了
The sun's going down.

1090
01:17:28,230 --> 01:17:30,880
太阳要下山了  太阳快下山了
The sun's getting really low. Sun's going down.

1091
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:40,090
我很生气
I'm upset!

1092
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:44,870
我非常生气
I'm very upset.

1093
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:47,430
知道我喜欢生气的哪一点吗  怪罪
You know what I like about being upset? The blame.

1094
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:49,880
现在  我就想做这个
Right now, that's the mindset that I'm in.

1095
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,140
知道我怪谁吗
And you know who I'm blaming?

1096
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:52,190
宗师  我可以...
Grandmaster, I can...

1097
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:53,760
别打断我
Don't interrupt me!

1098
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:54,600
给你
Here you go.

1099
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,900
你干吗把融化棍递给我
Why are you handing me the melt stick?

1100
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,090
他打断了我
He was interrupting.

1101
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:01,140
那又不是死罪
That's not a capital violation.

1102
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:02,620
我说到哪了
Where was I?

1103
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:05,280
我的宝贝冠军不见了
My precious champion has come up missing,

1104
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,430
这都是因为那个雷王
and it's all because of that Lord of Thunder.

1105
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:08,870
都怪他
It's all because of him.

1106
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:09,900
你哥哥
Your brother.

1107
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:13,340
不管你们怎么回事  是领养还是另有隐情
Whatever the story is. Adopted, or complicated, or you know.

1108
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:14,410
我相信有很多渊源
I'm sure there's a big history.

1109
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:15,740
他是你带来的参赛者
And your contender...

1110
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:17,160
亲爱的朋友
My dear friend,

1111
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,150
如果你能给我12小时
if you were to give me 12 hours,

1112
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:20,900
我可以把他俩都活着带回来
I could bring them both back to you. Alive.

1113
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,170
我两小时就能做到
I could do it in two.

1114
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:24,510
我一小时就能做到
I could do it in one.

1115
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:25,690
打住吧
Let's stop there.

1116
01:18:25,810 --> 01:18:27,350
知道吗  我今早醒来时 
You know what? I woke up this morning

1117
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:29,180
想的是公开处决
thinking about a public execution.

1118
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:32,650
但现在  我可以安于
But for now, I'll settle for this sweet little

1119
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:34,410
"谁能先抓到他"
"Who's gonna get him first?"

1120
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:37,850
所以  你们得抓紧了
So, you're on the clock.

1121
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:40,900
你做了什么
What have you done?

1122
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,410
我不听命于你  狗腿子
I don't answer to you, lackey.

1123
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:43,500
是洛基
It's Loki.

1124
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:45,820
你要听命于宗师
And you will answer to the Grandmaster.

1125
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:51,320
你为什么要帮我哥哥和那个绿傻瓜逃跑
Why would you help my brother escape with that green fool?

1126
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:53,060
我不帮任何人
I don't help anyone.

1127
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:00,880
你是个女武神
You're a Valkyrie.

1128
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,150
我以为女武神都惨死了
I thought the Valkyrie had all died gruesome deaths.

1129
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:10,690
接下来要说什么想好了
Choose your next words wisely.

1130
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:14,030
非常抱歉  那记忆一定很痛苦
I'm terribly sorry. Must be a very painful memory.

1131
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:08,720
太阳快下山了  要下山了
The sun's going down. It's getting really low.

1132
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,290
太阳快下山了  要下山了
The sun's going down. It's getting real low.

1133
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:12,660
该死
Oh, shoot.

1134
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:15,900
-太阳快下山了  -你能不能别念叨了
- Sun's getting low. - Would you stop saying that?

1135
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:17,110
我就是需要你保持冷静
I just need you to stay calm.

1136
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:19,220
冷静  我在外星球上
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1137
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:21,070
反正就是个星球  星球你也是去过的
This is just a planet. You've been on a planet before.

1138
01:20:21,070 --> 01:20:21,990
是啊  就一个
Yeah. One.

1139
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:24,010
现在你去过俩了  这是好事
Now you've been on two. That's a good thing.

1140
01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:25,510
-这是新体验  -天呐
- It's a new experience. - Oh, my God.

1141
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:26,470
我的神经元
My neurons,

1142
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:29,570
已经在超过我大脑信息处理速度地运作了
they're firing faster than my brain can handle the information.

1143
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,110
这次的感觉完全不一样
The whole thing is totally different this time.

1144
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,210
以前  我一直觉得
In the past, I always felt

1145
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:35,730
我和绿巨人各有一只手把着方向盘
like Hulk and I each had a hand on the wheel.

1146
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,830
但这次  就好像他拿了车钥匙
But this time, it's like he had the keys to the car

1147
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:39,430
而我被锁在后备箱里
and I was locked in the trunk.

1148
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:41,250
你现在回来了  这才最重要
All right, well, you're back now. That's all that matters.

1149
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:42,270
不  不是的
No, it's not what matters.

1150
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:43,110
我就是想告诉你
What I'm trying to tell you,

1151
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:45,320
如果我再变成绿巨人
is that if I turn into the Hulk again,

1152
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:46,850
班纳可能就再也回不来了
Banner may never come back.

1153
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:50,490
而且我们还困在一颗一切都让我紧张的星球上
And we're stranded on a planet that is designed to stress me out.

1154
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:53,280
我们没被困  我会想到办法回家的
We're not stranded. I'm gonna figure out a way to get us home.

1155
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:54,630
谢谢
Thank you.

1156
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:57,080
不是你家  我的家  阿斯加德
Not your home, though. Asgard. My home.

1157
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:57,810
什么
What?

1158
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,480
听着  我的人民身陷危险
Listen, my people are in great danger.

1159
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:02,900
你和我  我们得去击退一个非常厉害的人
You and I, we have to fight this really powerful being,

1160
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,280
碰巧她还是我姐姐
who also happens to be my sister.

1161
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:06,420
好吧  这太离谱了
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...

1162
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:09,130
我不想打你姐姐  这是家庭问题
I don't wanna fight your sister. That's a family issue.

1163
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:10,470
不  她是邪恶化身
No, she's an evil being.

1164
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,390
我不管她怎么样
I don't care what she is.

1165
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,980
我不要再打谁了  我受够了
I'm not fighting any more beings. I'm sick of it.

1166
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:16,280
-什么  -我刚跟你说了
- What? - I just told you.

1167
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:19,490
如果我再变成绿巨人  我会变不回来的
If I turn into the Hulk, I am never gonna come back again.

1168
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:20,410
你都不在乎
And you don't care.

1169
01:21:20,410 --> 01:21:22,450
不不  我要组建一支队伍
No, no. I'm putting together the team.

1170
01:21:22,450 --> 01:21:23,730
绿巨人是火
The Hulk is the fire.

1171
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:25,840
等等  你是在利用我得到绿巨人
Wait, you're just using me to get to the Hulk.

1172
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:26,570
-什么  -真过分
- What? - It's gross.

1173
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:27,340
什么  不是的
What? No!

1174
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:29,520
你才不在乎我呢  你不是我的朋友
You don't care about me. You're not my friend.

1175
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,750
才不是  我都不喜欢绿巨人  他就...
No! I don't even like the Hulk. He's all like...

1176
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,210
"砸扁  砸扁  砸扁"
"Smash, smash, smash."

1177
01:21:34,210 --> 01:21:35,790
我更喜欢你
I prefer you.

1178
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:37,530
谢谢
Thanks.

1179
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:41,470
但老实说  在对抗邪恶化身这件事上
But if I'm being honest, when it comes to fighting evil beings,

1180
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:42,960
他是很强大很有帮助
he is very powerful and useful.

1181
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,100
班纳也很强大很有帮助
Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.

1182
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:45,750
是吗
Is he though?

1183
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:48,310
好吧  绿巨人有几个博士学位  零
Okay. How many PhDs does Hulk have? Zero.

1184
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,460
班纳有多少个博士学位  七个
How many PhDs does Banner have? Seven.

1185
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,390
好吧  你不用打任何人
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone.

1186
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:55,320
但我们在这里有危险  我们得走了
But we're in danger here, so we have to move.

1187
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:00,150
你拿那个做什么
What are you doing with that?

1188
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:01,710
我需要伪装  我是逃犯
I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.

1189
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:03,970
-我也需要伪装  -你就是伪装
- I need a disguise. - You are the disguise.

1190
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:05,780
-我装成托尼·斯塔克  -什么
- I'll be Tony Stark. - What?

1191
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:08,020
嗯  托尼和吉普赛人
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1192
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:10,540
不  你不是托尼  你是布鲁斯·班纳
No, no, you're not Tony. You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1193
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:11,970
那你为什么把我打扮成托尼
Then why did you dress me up like Tony?

1194
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:13,220
因为你光着呢
Because you were naked.

1195
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,640
好吧  这是个好理由
Okay, I'll give you that.

1196
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:16,390
你干什么呢  别乱抓了
What are you doing? Stop doing that!

1197
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:17,890
托尼的裤子好紧
Tony wears his pants super tight.

1198
01:22:17,890 --> 01:22:19,130
-别抓了  -抱歉
- Stop it! - I'm sorry.

1199
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:21,430
-你为什么怪怪的  -我不知道
- Why are you being so weird? - I don't know.

1200
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:24,050
或许我在一个怪物体内
Maybe the fact that I was trapped for two years

1201
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:27,190
困了两年所以才怪怪的
inside of a monster made me a little weird.

1202
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:28,590
没事的
It's okay.

1203
01:22:28,730 --> 01:22:31,110
你没事的  冷静下来  走吧
You're good. Calm down. Calm down. Come on.

1204
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:32,780
我们去阿斯加德
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard

1205
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:35,020
你再也不用去想绿巨人了
and you're not gonna have to think about the Hulk ever again.

1206
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:36,190
-好吗  -好
- All right? - All right.

1207
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:43,420
绿巨人  绿巨人
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

1208
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:45,370
这可太糟了
This is bad.

1209
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:51,450
班纳  班纳
Banner! Banner!

1210
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:55,860
班纳
Banner!

1211
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:10,830
班纳
Banner!

1212
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:12,580
托尔
Thor!

1213
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:27,470
我正打算那么做呢
I was gonna do that.

1214
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:28,970
我先做了
Yeah, well, I did it first.

1215
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:31,600
很好  你在这儿干什么
That's good. What are you doing here?

1216
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,470
你在这儿干什么  你不是要走吗
What are you doing here? I thought you were leaving.

1217
01:23:33,470 --> 01:23:35,100
出了点小岔子
I got sidetracked.

1218
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:36,620
这是怎么...
What's with the...

1219
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:37,920
是我的伪装
It's my disguise.

1220
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,330
但我能看到你的脸
But I can see your face.

1221
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,210
我这样你不就看不到了
Not when I do this, you can't.

1222
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:42,870
你发型不错
Your hair looks nice.

1223
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:45,770
我喜欢你的处理  换过吗  还是洗了
I like what you did with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?

1224
01:23:51,210 --> 01:23:52,650
她眼睛上那个是什么
What are those things on her eyes?

1225
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:54,030
是她杀过的人吗
Are those people that she's killed?

1226
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:55,840
她好美  强壮又勇敢
She's so beautiful and strong and courageous.

1227
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:56,930
这家伙是谁
Who is this guy?

1228
01:23:56,930 --> 01:23:57,930
-我吗  -我朋友  
- Who? Me? - He's a friend.

1229
01:23:57,930 --> 01:23:59,380
-我是布鲁斯  -我觉得我认识你
- I'm Bruce. - I feel like I know you.

1230
01:24:00,030 --> 01:24:01,440
我也这么觉得
I feel like I know you, too.

1231
01:24:06,490 --> 01:24:10,200
听着  我多年来浑浑噩噩  想忘记过去
Look, I've spent years in a haze, trying to forget my past.

1232
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:12,550
萨卡似乎是借酒消愁  忘记过去
Sakaar seemed like the best place to drink and forget,

1233
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:13,950
混吃等死的绝佳之处
and to die one day.

1234
01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:16,110
我是觉得你喝得太多了
I was thinking that you drink too much,

1235
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:17,430
可能会因此没命
and that probably was gonna kill you.

1236
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:19,090
我没打算停止喝酒
I don't plan to stop drinking.

1237
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:21,130
但我不想忘记
But I don't wanna forget.

1238
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:22,260
我不能再扭头不管了
I can't turn away anymore,

1239
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:25,170
所以  如果我要死
so if I'm gonna die, well,

1240
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,120
那不如是为了把我的剑
it may as well be driving my sword

1241
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,940
插进那个屠夫婆娘的心脏
through the heart of that murderous hag.

1242
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:30,320
-很好  -嗯
- Good. - Yeah.

1243
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:33,490
所以  我是说  我想加入你的团队
So, I'm saying that I wanna be on the team.

1244
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:35,090
有名字了吗
Has it got a name?

1245
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,560
嗯  叫报仇者联盟
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.

1246
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:39,460
报仇者
Revengers?

1247
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:42,790
因为我要报仇  你也要报仇
Because I'm getting revenge. You're getting revenge.

1248
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:45,600
还有你  你想报仇吗
You, too. What do you... Do you want revenge?

1249
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:48,410
-我还没决定  -好
- I'm undecided. - Okay.

1250
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:51,210
另外  我还带了示和礼物
Also, I've got a peace offering.

1251
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,500
惊不惊喜
Surprise.

1252
01:25:03,290 --> 01:25:04,300
得确认一下
Just had to be sure.

1253
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:09,530
你好  布鲁斯
Hello, Bruce.

1254
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:14,640
上次我见你时  你想杀了所有人
So, last time I saw you, you were trying to kill everybody.

1255
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:15,890
你现在都在忙什么
Where are you at these days?

1256
01:25:15,890 --> 01:25:17,980
每时每刻都不一样
It varies from moment to moment.

1257
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,420
那是龙牙剑吗
Is that a Dragonfang?

1258
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,430
是的
It is.

1259
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:23,300
天啊
My God.

1260
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:25,960
这就是著名的女武神之剑
This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.

1261
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,690
萨卡和阿斯加德
So, Sakaar and Asgard are about

1262
01:25:27,690 --> 01:25:29,600
之间离得不能更远了
as far apart as any two known systems.

1263
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,240
最好的办法  是走城外的一个虫洞
Our best bet is a wormhole just outside of city limits.

1264
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:36,180
在山达尔补充燃料  18个月后就能回到阿斯加德了
Refuel on Xandar, and we can be back in Asgard in 18 months.

1265
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:39,250
不行  我们要走大的那个
Nope. We are going through the big one.

1266
01:25:39,570 --> 01:25:41,020
魔鬼屁眼
The Devil's Anus?

1267
01:25:41,090 --> 01:25:42,000
屁眼
Anus?

1268
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:43,300
等等  谁的屁眼
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?

1269
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:45,570
声明一下  我选的时候不知道它叫这么个名字
For the record, I didn't know it was called that when I picked it.

1270
01:25:45,570 --> 01:25:47,880
看起来像是在爱因斯坦罗森桥[虫洞]内
That looks like a collapsing neutron star inside of

1271
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:49,820
坍缩的中子星
an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

1272
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:52,690
我们需要另找艘船  它会把我的船撕成碎片
We need another ship. That will tear mine to pieces.

1273
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:54,080
她说得对  我们需要一艘能禁得住
She's right. We need one that can withstand

1274
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,050
奇点短程线拉力的船
the geodetic strain from the singularity.

1275
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:57,980
还得有脱机动力转向系统
And has an offline power steering system

1276
01:25:57,980 --> 01:26:00,420
没有机载电脑也能运行
that could also function without the on board computer.

1277
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:01,920
还得有杯托
And we need one with cup holders,

1278
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,140
因为我们要死了  喝酒吧
because we're gonna die. So, drinks!

1279
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:06,180
我认识你吗  我好像认识你
Do I know you? I feel like I know you.

1280
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:08,060
我也觉得我认识你  好奇怪
I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.

1281
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:08,970
你觉得怎么样
What do you say?

1282
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:12,020
穿过不稳定的宇宙传送门进行未知总星系旅行
Uncharted metagalactic travel through a volatile cosmic gateway.

1283
01:26:12,030 --> 01:26:13,390
这才叫冒险
Talk about an adventure.

1284
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:15,440
-我们需要一艘飞船  -没错
- We need a ship. - Need a ship.

1285
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:18,050
有那么一两艘飞船  绝对是最顶尖的
There are one or two ships. Absolute top of the line models...

1286
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:19,550
你们不非得听我的
I don't mean to impose...

1287
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,890
但宗师有很多飞船
But the Grandmaster has a great many ships.

1288
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:28,530
我可能还偷到了他安全系统的密码
I may even have stolen the access codes to his security system.

1289
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:31,040
还突然难以抑制地想行正义之举吗
And suddenly you're overcome with an urge to do the right thing.

1290
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,110
天啊  不是
Heavens, no.

1291
01:26:32,110 --> 01:26:33,740
宗师对我的好感已消磨殆尽
I've run out of favor with the Grandmaster,

1292
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:35,830
我用飞船和密码
and in exchange for codes and access to a ship,

1293
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:39,250
换安全穿过屁眼
I'm asking for safe passage through the Anus.

1294
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:42,590
你是说  你能让我们进入机库
You're telling us that you can get us access into the garage

1295
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:44,400
而不触发警报
without setting off any alarms?

1296
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,750
对  哥哥  我可以
Yes, brother. I can.

1297
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:48,970
好  我先...提醒你们一下
Okay, can I just... A quick FYI.

1298
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:51,050
我几分钟前跟他说话的时候
I was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago

1299
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:53,380
他很想杀了我们
and he was totally ready to kill any of us.

1300
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:54,320
他确实想杀我来着
He did try to kill me.

1301
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:56,450
是啊  我也是  好多次呢
Yes, me too. On many, many occasions.

1302
01:26:56,450 --> 01:26:58,130
我们小时候  有一次
There was one time when we were children,

1303
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:00,030
他变成了一条蛇
he transformed himself into a snake,

1304
01:27:00,030 --> 01:27:01,380
他知道我喜欢蛇
and he knows that I love snakes.

1305
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:03,270
我捡起蛇  好好欣赏
So, I went to pick up the snake to admire it,

1306
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:04,880
结果他变了回去
and he transformed back into himself

1307
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:06,080
大喊  "嘿  是我"
and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"

1308
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:09,260
然后捅了我  我们当时才八岁
And he stabbed me. We were eight at the time.

1309
01:27:09,690 --> 01:27:10,810
我们要偷飞船的话
If we're boosting a ship

1310
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:12,810
得把王宫的守卫引开
we're gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace.

1311
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:14,770
放出野兽吧
Why not set the beast loose?

1312
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:15,510
闭嘴
Shut up.

1313
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:16,740
你们有野兽
You guys have a beast?

1314
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:19,210
没有  没什么野兽  他在胡说
No, there's no beast. He's just being stupid.

1315
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,930
我们要挑起革命
We're going to start a revolution.

1316
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:22,820
-革命  -我过会儿再解释
- Revolution? - I'll explain later.

1317
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:25,220
-他是谁来着 -过会儿再解释
- Who's this guy again? - I'll explain later.

1318
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:28,780
你拉出来的
Is that some sort of protoplasm,

1319
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:31,390
是原生质吗  还是卵
all the stuff that's coming out of you, or are they eggs?

1320
01:27:32,490 --> 01:27:33,620
看起来像卵
Looks like eggs.

1321
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,640
我找寇格
I'm looking for Korg.

1322
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,620
谁找我
Who's asking?

1323
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:47,110
我知道是你
I know you're asking.

1324
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,840
还有别人吗  还是只有你
Is there anyone else asking, or is it just you?

1325
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:52,060
雷王向你问好
The Lord of Thunder sends his best.

1326
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:57,270
革命开始了
The revolution has begun.

1327
01:27:57,730 --> 01:27:59,790
革命  怎么会这样
Revolution? How did this happen?

1328
01:27:59,890 --> 01:28:00,650
不知道
Don't know.

1329
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:03,980
但角斗场的服从圆盘主机
But the arena's mainframe for the Obedience Disks

1330
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:05,220
被关掉了
have been deactivated

1331
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:07,340
奴隶都武装起来了
and the slaves have armed themselves.

1332
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:08,850
我不喜欢那个词
I don't like that word.

1333
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:10,330
哪个  主机吗
Which? Mainframe?

1334
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:12,840
不是  我怎么会不喜欢"主机"
No. Why would I not like "mainframe"?

1335
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,120
S开头的那个
No, the "S" word.

1336
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:18,260
抱歉  在职囚犯们都武装起来了
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs have armed themselves.

1337
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:20,920
这样好多了
Okay, that's better. That's better.

1338
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:28,770
听着  我们应该谈谈
So, listen. We should talk.

1339
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:31,180
我不同意
I disagree.

1340
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:34,380
我们家从来就不擅长开诚布公
Open communication was never our family's forte.

1341
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:35,870
可不是呢
You have no idea.

1342
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:38,580
我们上次谈过后发现的真相很是了不得
Been quite the revelation since we last spoke.

1343
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:39,850
你们好
Hello.

1344
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:50,320
奥丁让我们聚在一起
Odin brought us together.

1345
01:28:51,190 --> 01:28:53,840
他的死让我们分裂  还挺诗意
It's almost poetic that his death should split us apart.

1346
01:29:00,290 --> 01:29:01,800
我们现在与陌生人无异
We might as well be strangers now.

1347
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:05,520
两位王子  各自漂泊
Two sons of the crown, set adrift.

1348
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:10,160
你不是不想谈吗
Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.

1349
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:12,860
问题是...
Here's the thing.

1350
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:14,740
我可能留在萨卡更好
I'm probably better off staying here on Sakaar.

1351
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:16,380
我也这么想
That's exactly what I was thinking.

1352
01:29:18,590 --> 01:29:19,880
你刚刚是在同意我说的话吗
Did you just agree with me?

1353
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:21,650
这地方太适合你了
Come on, this place is perfect for you.

1354
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:23,550
野蛮  混乱  无法无天
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...

1355
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:24,910
弟弟  你会在这儿如鱼得水的
Brother, you're gonna do great here.

1356
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:27,490
你就真这么瞧不起我
Do you truly think so little of me?

1357
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:31,210
洛基  我曾非常看重你
Loki, I thought the world of you.

1358
01:29:32,230 --> 01:29:34,210
我以为我们能永远并肩战斗
I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever.

1359
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:37,770
但最终  你是你  我是我
But at the end of the day, you're you and I'm me.

1360
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:40,680
我也说不好  或许你还有一丝良心  但
I don't know, maybe there's still good in you, but...

1361
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:44,310
说实话  我们早已分道扬镳
let's be honest, our paths diverged a long time ago.

1362
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:49,940
是啊
Yeah.

1363
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:53,800
或许我们还是再也不要见面了比较好
It's probably for the best that we never see each other again.

1364
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:55,260
这不是你一直想要的吗
It's what you always wanted.

1365
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:00,720
我们来演"喊救命"吧
Hey, let's do "Get Help."

1366
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,820
-什么  -"喊救命"
- What? - "Get Help."

1367
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:03,500
不
No.

1368
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:04,570
-来嘛  你最喜欢了  -我非常讨厌
- Come on, you love it. - I hate it.

1369
01:30:04,570 --> 01:30:06,440
-这招多棒啊  每次都好使  -太丢人了
- It's great. It works every time. - It's humiliating.

1370
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:07,680
-你有更好的计划吗  -没有
- Do you have a better plan? - No.

1371
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:08,560
那就这么办
We're doing it.

1372
01:30:09,010 --> 01:30:11,040
我才不要演"喊救命"
We are not doing "Get Help."

1373
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:13,580
救命  求你们了
Get help! Please!

1374
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:14,770
我弟弟快死了
My brother, he's dying.

1375
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:16,640
救命  帮帮他吧
Get help! Help him!

1376
01:30:18,860 --> 01:30:19,760
经典
Classic.

1377
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:21,200
我还是讨厌
Still hate it.

1378
01:30:21,410 --> 01:30:23,380
-太丢人了  -我又不丢人
- It's humiliating. - Not for me, it's not.

1379
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:25,990
好了  她让我们上哪艘船来着
Now, which one's the ship she told us to get?

1380
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:27,420
司令号
The Commodore.

1381
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:28,760
好的
Right.

1382
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:33,850
不过我觉得应该也没什么用
Though I feel it won't make much of a difference.

1383
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:38,270
洛基
Loki.

1384
01:30:39,430 --> 01:30:41,040
我知道我背叛过你很多次
I know I've betrayed you many times before,

1385
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,890
但这次真不是针对你
but this time it's truly nothing personal.

1386
01:30:42,890 --> 01:30:46,040
抓到你的赏金会让我过得很阔绰
The reward for your capture will set me up nicely.

1387
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,630
你果然从不是个重感情的人
Never one for sentiment, were you?

1388
01:30:47,630 --> 01:30:49,260
无情会过得更轻松些
Easier to let it burn.

1389
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:50,690
我同意
I agree.

1390
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:00,550
看起来好痛
That looks painful.

1391
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:04,450
亲爱的弟弟  你越来越好猜了
Dear brother, you're becoming predictable.

1392
01:31:04,450 --> 01:31:06,370
我信任你  你背叛我
I trust you, you betray me.

1393
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:08,650
一遍又一遍
Round and round in circles we go.

1394
01:31:08,770 --> 01:31:11,130
洛基  人生  是要成长的
See, Loki, life is about... It's about growth.

1395
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:12,080
是要改变的
It's about change.

1396
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:15,540
但你好像只想保持原样
But you seem to just wanna stay the same.

1397
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:17,500
我想说的是
I guess what I'm trying to say

1398
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:20,600
你永远都只是恶作剧之神
is that you'll always be the God of Mischief,

1399
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:22,610
但你本可不止如此
but you could be more.

1400
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,820
我就把这个留给你了
I'll just put this over here for you.

1401
01:31:27,150 --> 01:31:30,820
好了  我们都还有地方要去  所以祝你好运了
Anyway, all got places to be, so good luck, I guess.

1402
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,300
好了  你能搞定的
All right, you can figure this out.

1403
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:39,880
不过是又一艘宇宙飞船罢了
It's just another spaceship.

1404
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:54,730
忠诚的萨卡人
Loyal Sakaarians,

1405
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:58,560
雷王偷了我的飞船和我最爱的冠军
Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship and my favorite champion.

1406
01:31:59,730 --> 01:32:03,100
萨卡人  升空  把他打下来
Sakaarians, take to the skies. Bring him down.

1407
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:04,980
不要让他离开这个星球
Do not let him leave this planet.

1408
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:19,630
-打得不错  -谢谢
- Good shot! - Thanks.

1409
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:23,120
开门
Open the doors.

1410
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,060
好
Okay.

1411
01:32:29,530 --> 01:32:31,830
我希望你比看起来要坚强一些
I hope that you're tougher than you look.

1412
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:32,800
为什么
Why?

1413
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,430
我们不该反击什么的吗
Shouldn't we be shooting back or something?

1414
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:48,420
是应该
Yes, we should.

1415
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:50,540
这船上的武器在哪里
Where are the guns on this ship?

1416
01:32:50,590 --> 01:32:52,020
没有武器
There aren't any.

1417
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,890
-这是艘消遣船  -什么
- It's a leisure vessel. - What?

1418
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:57,170
宗师用它来享乐的  群交派对之类的
Grandmaster uses it for his good times, orgies and stuff.

1419
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,780
她刚刚是说宗师用这船办群交派对吗
Did she just say the Grandmaster uses it for orgies?

1420
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:00,590
是的
Yeah.

1421
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:02,240
什么都别碰
Don't touch anything.

1422
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:23,760
不  不
No! No!

1423
01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:28,530
-不  -不
- No! - No!

1424
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:36,430
进来
Get inside!

1425
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:37,880
马上
In a minute.

1426
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:51,040
我该去帮帮她  你过来开
I should probably go and help. Here, take the wheel.

1427
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,840
不行  我不会开这个
No. I don't know how to fly one of these.

1428
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:54,660
你是个科学家  用你的博士学位去搞明白
You're a scientist. Use one of your PhDs.

1429
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:58,490
那些学位都不是外星飞船驾驶啊
None of them are for flying alien spaceships!

1430
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:33,750
好吧  拜托
Okay, come on.

1431
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,440
这上面肯定有枪的
There's gotta be a gun on this thing.

1432
01:34:35,850 --> 01:34:37,080
那看起来好像是枪
That looks like a gun.

1433
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:41,480
今天我生日  今天我生日
It's my birthday. It's my birthday.

1434
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:43,950
今天我生日
It's my birthday.

1435
01:34:50,850 --> 01:34:52,010
好啊
Yeah!

1436
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:11,770
伙计们  我们马上就要进入恶魔屁眼了
Guys, we're coming up on the Devil's Anus!

1437
01:35:18,410 --> 01:35:19,680
在那儿
There she is.

1438
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:21,160
我们逃离的途径
Our ticket out of here.

1439
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:23,420
这是什么
Hey, what's this?

1440
01:35:28,510 --> 01:35:29,230
谢谢
Thank you.

1441
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:32,230
老兄  我们要跳上那艘超大飞船离开这里
Hey, man. We're about to jump on that ginormous spaceship.

1442
01:35:32,230 --> 01:35:33,050
要一起来吗
You wanna come?

1443
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:37,930
你们看起来确实急需一位领袖
You do seem like you're in desperate need of leadership.

1444
01:35:37,930 --> 01:35:39,040
谢谢
Why, thank you.

1445
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,500
来了
Here we go.

1446
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:52,110
该死
Shit.

1447
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,200
阿斯加德人民
Asgardians...

1448
01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:14,020
有不知好歹的人
Some misguided soul

1449
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,780
偷走了彩虹桥之剑
has stolen the Bifrost sword.

1450
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:18,940
告诉我们它在哪里
Tell us where it is

1451
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:22,000
否则后果自负
or there will be consequences.

1452
01:36:25,890 --> 01:36:27,460
严重的后果
Bad ones.

1453
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:31,130
有人说吗
Well?

1454
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:39,470
你
You.

1455
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:44,280
不  住手
No! Stop!

1456
01:36:46,850 --> 01:36:47,580
求你们
Please.

1457
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:19,550
动手啊  处刑人
Well? Executioner?

1458
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:25,670
等等
Wait!

1459
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:27,050
等等
Wait!

1460
01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:30,870
我知道剑在哪
I know where the sword is.

1461
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,350
没想到我还能再回来
I never thought I'd be back here.

1462
01:38:19,450 --> 01:38:21,010
我以为会更美一些呢
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.

1463
01:38:21,330 --> 01:38:24,720
倒不是说它不美  只是着火了
I mean, not that it's not nice. It's just, it's on fire.

1464
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,170
看  山上
Here, up here in the mountains.

1465
01:38:26,170 --> 01:38:28,500
有热信号  那里聚集了很多人
Heat signatures. People clustered together.

1466
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:29,600
她要去找他们了
She's coming for them.

1467
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,950
好  把我丢在王宫  我去引开她
Okay, drop me off at the palace and I'll draw her away.

1468
01:38:31,950 --> 01:38:33,140
你想害死自己吗
And get yourself killed?

1469
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:34,780
困在那里的人才是最重要的
The people trapped down there are all that matters.

1470
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:36,010
我去应付海拉时
While I'm dealing with Hela,

1471
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:37,990
你们得疏散阿斯加德的人民
I need you two to help get everyone off Asgard.

1472
01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:39,740
我们要怎么做啊
How the hell are we supposed to do that?

1473
01:38:40,270 --> 01:38:41,760
我在地面上有人接应
I have a man on the ground.

1474
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:48,980
阿斯加德人民
Asgard.

1475
01:38:52,150 --> 01:38:53,040
她来了
She's here.

1476
01:39:05,150 --> 01:39:06,740
这下飞船有火力了
Now the ship has a gun.

1477
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:08,140
交给我吧
I'll take it from here.

1478
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:11,830
我在武器库发现了这个
I found this in the armory.

1479
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,130
祝你好运
Good luck.

1480
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:18,970
陛下
Your Majesty...

1481
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:22,250
别死了
Don't die.

1482
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:26,290
你懂我意思的
You know what I mean.

1483
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:27,330
别停步
We must keep moving!

1484
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:30,030
去彩虹桥
Go to the Bifrost!

1485
01:41:12,870 --> 01:41:13,750
姐姐
Sister.

1486
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:17,830
你还活着
You're still alive.

1487
01:41:18,230 --> 01:41:21,720
我喜欢你对这里的改造  重装修了啊
I love what you've done with the place. Redecorating, I see.

1488
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:24,000
看来我们父亲解决
It seems our father's solution

1489
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,120
所有问题的思路都是掩盖
to every problem was to cover it up.

1490
01:41:28,150 --> 01:41:29,550
或驱逐
Or to cast it out.

1491
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:35,420
他对你说你有资格  他也对我说过这话
He told you you were worthy. He said the same thing to me.

1492
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:37,330
你瞧
You see?

1493
01:41:38,180 --> 01:41:39,780
你根本不了解他
You never knew him.

1494
01:41:40,550 --> 01:41:42,060
没见过他最辉煌的时刻
Not at his best.

1495
01:41:42,890 --> 01:41:47,380
奥丁和我曾让整个文明淹死在血泪之中
Odin and I drowned entire civilizations in blood and tears.

1496
01:41:47,490 --> 01:41:49,790
你以为这些金子是哪来的
Where do you think all this gold came from?

1497
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:52,430
然后  有一天
And then, one day,

1498
01:41:52,430 --> 01:41:55,050
他突然决定做个仁慈的君王
he decided to become a benevolent king.

1499
01:41:55,490 --> 01:41:57,900
制造和平  保护生命
To foster peace, to protect life.

1500
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:00,720
生下你
To have you.

1501
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:03,360
我能理解你的愤怒
I understand why you're angry.

1502
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:04,510
你毕竟是我姐姐
And you are my sister,

1503
01:42:04,510 --> 01:42:07,250
严格讲  有权继承王位
and technically have a claim to the throne.

1504
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:09,900
相信我  我也愿意别人来统治
And believe me, I would love for someone else to rule.

1505
01:42:09,910 --> 01:42:11,060
但那不能是你
But it can't be you.

1506
01:42:11,070 --> 01:42:14,770
你真是坏透了
You're just the worst.

1507
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:17,770
好吧  起来
Okay, get up.

1508
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:20,020
你坐在我的位置上了
You're in my seat.

1509
01:42:21,410 --> 01:42:23,060
父亲曾对我说
You know, Father once told me

1510
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:26,190
一位明君从不挑起战争
that a wise king never seeks out war.

1511
01:42:26,190 --> 01:42:29,100
但必须时刻做好准备
But must always be ready for it.

1512
01:43:00,890 --> 01:43:01,800
回去
Go back!

1513
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:08,290
回去
Go!

1514
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,080
老实说  我以为你有更大本事呢
To be honest, I expected more.

1515
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:51,340
海姆达尔
Heimdall!

1516
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:54,610
剑
The sword!

1517
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:00,980
我们的不同之处在于
Here's the difference between us.

1518
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:02,520
我是奥丁的长女
I'm Odin's firstborn,

1519
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:05,470
合法继承人  阿斯加德的拯救者
the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard.

1520
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:07,030
你什么都不是
And you're nothing.

1521
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:20,480
如此简单  瞎子都看得清
So simple, even a blind man could see it.

1522
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:26,010
这下你让我想起了爸爸
Now you remind me of Dad.

1523
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,620
那只臭狗打不死
The stupid dog won't die!

1524
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:02,870
没事了  交给我吧
Everything's gonna be all right now. I got this.

1525
01:45:02,870 --> 01:45:04,700
你想知道我是谁
You wanted to know who I am?

1526
01:45:06,210 --> 01:45:07,900
你说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

1527
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:09,410
你会看到的
You'll see!

1528
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:00,620
瞧  谁都别想跑
You see? No one's going anywhere.

1529
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:01,780
我会拿到那把剑
I'll get that sword,

1530
01:46:01,780 --> 01:46:04,150
哪怕我为此要杀光他们每个人
even if I have to kill every single one of them to do it.

1531
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:32,430
伙计
Hey, man.

1532
01:46:34,010 --> 01:46:35,460
我是寇格  这是米克
I'm Korg. This is Miek.

1533
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:37,480
我们要跳上那艘飞船离开这里
We're gonna jump on that spaceship and get out of here.

1534
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:38,390
要一起来吗
Wanna come?

1535
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:51,560
你们的拯救者到了
Your savior is here.

1536
01:46:58,970 --> 01:46:59,890
想我了吗
Did you miss me?

1537
01:47:00,610 --> 01:47:02,570
大家快上船吧
Everyone, on that ship now.

1538
01:47:06,850 --> 01:47:09,150
欢迎回家  我看到你来了
Welcome home. I saw you coming.

1539
01:47:09,150 --> 01:47:09,930
当然了
Of course you did.

1540
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:29,570
虽然是英勇之举  但你们毫无胜算
It's a valiant effort, but you never stood a chance.

1541
01:47:30,030 --> 01:47:30,980
瞧
You see...

1542
01:47:31,730 --> 01:47:34,930
我不是女王  或怪物
I'm not a queen or a monster.

1543
01:47:36,730 --> 01:47:38,460
我是死亡女神
I'm the Goddess of Death.

1544
01:47:39,410 --> 01:47:41,810
你是什么的神来着
What were you the god of, again?

1545
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:55,290
就算是你有两只眼睛时
Even when you had two eyes,

1546
01:47:55,950 --> 01:47:57,630
也只能看清一半
you'd see only half the picture.

1547
01:47:59,270 --> 01:48:02,360
她太强大了  没有锤子  我做不到
She's too strong. Without my hammer, I can't.

1548
01:48:03,330 --> 01:48:05,720
你是托尔  锤子之神吗
Are you Thor, the God of Hammers?

1549
01:48:10,010 --> 01:48:13,610
锤子是用来帮你控制力量  集中力量的
That hammer was to help you control your power, to focus it.

1550
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:16,190
不是你力量的源泉
It was never your source of strength.

1551
01:48:16,940 --> 01:48:19,480
太迟了  她已经夺下了阿斯加德
It's too late. She's already taken Asgard.

1552
01:48:20,330 --> 01:48:22,740
阿斯加德不是一个地方  从来不是
Asgard is not a place. Never was.

1553
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:25,610
这里就可以是阿斯加德
This could be Asgard.

1554
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:28,910
阿斯加德是我们人民的所在
Asgard is where our people stand.

1555
01:48:29,770 --> 01:48:34,620
而现在  那些人民需要你的帮助
Even now, right now, those people need your help.

1556
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:43,710
我不像你那么强大
I'm not as strong as you.

1557
01:48:47,110 --> 01:48:47,800
是啊
No...

1558
01:48:49,610 --> 01:48:50,450
你比我更强大
You're stronger.

1559
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:01,250
告诉我  弟弟
Tell me, brother.

1560
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:03,770
你是什么的神来着
What were you the god of, again?

1561
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:21,440
-你来迟了  -你缺了只眼睛
- You're late. - You're missing an eye.

1562
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:22,640
还没打完呢
This isn't over.

1563
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:32,350
我觉得我们该解散报仇者
I think we should disband the Revengers.

1564
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:34,810
用闪电打她
Hit her with a lightning blast.

1565
01:51:34,810 --> 01:51:35,700
我刚用史上
I just hit her with the

1566
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:37,580
最大的闪电打她了
biggest lightning blast in the history of lightning.

1567
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:38,660
毫无作用
It did nothing.

1568
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:44,930
我们得抵住她  直到大家都上了船
We just need to hold her off until everyone's on board.

1569
01:51:45,410 --> 01:51:46,640
那也不是个完
It won't end there.

1570
01:51:47,230 --> 01:51:50,580
海拉在阿斯加德待得越久  她就越强大
The longer Hela's on Asgard, the more powerful she grows.

1571
01:51:50,710 --> 01:51:51,850
她会找到我们的
She'll hunt us down.

1572
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:54,360
我们得在此时此地阻止她
We need to stop her here and now.

1573
01:51:54,430 --> 01:51:55,580
我们怎么办
So what do we do?

1574
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:57,820
我不要再演"喊救命"了
I'm not doing "Get Help."

1575
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:12,420
阿斯加德不是一个地方  是人民所在
Asgard's not a place, it's a people.

1576
01:52:15,590 --> 01:52:16,370
洛基
Loki,

1577
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:18,560
我们根本不是要阻止诸神黄昏
this was never about stopping Ragnarok.

1578
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:20,900
我们要引发诸神黄昏
This was about causing Ragnarok.

1579
01:52:20,970 --> 01:52:22,740
苏尔特尔的王冠  在地堡里
Surtur's crown, the vault.

1580
01:52:24,010 --> 01:52:24,990
只能如此
It's the only way.

1581
01:52:26,210 --> 01:52:27,310
真大胆  哥哥
Bold move, brother.

1582
01:52:28,890 --> 01:52:29,890
我都不敢想
Even for me.

1583
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:34,520
我们来吧
Shall we?

1584
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:36,910
你先请
After you.

1585
01:53:02,210 --> 01:53:03,400
这真是疯了
This is madness.

1586
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:19,050
走  快走
Go! Go, now!

1587
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:21,470
为了阿斯加德
For Asgard.

1588
01:54:35,770 --> 01:54:37,110
海拉
Hela!

1589
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:05,510
永恒烈火将让你重生
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

1590
01:55:17,190 --> 01:55:18,770
海拉  够了
Hela, enough!

1591
01:55:22,370 --> 01:55:25,020
你想要阿斯加德  它是你的了
You want Asgard, it's yours.

1592
01:55:25,310 --> 01:55:28,650
不管你在玩什么把戏  不会成功的
Whatever game you're playing, it won't work.

1593
01:55:28,990 --> 01:55:30,710
你休想打败我
You can't defeat me.

1594
01:55:31,350 --> 01:55:32,310
我知道
No, I know.

1595
01:55:34,470 --> 01:55:35,290
但他能
But he can.

1596
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:40,480
不
No.

1597
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:52,470
在我脚下震颤吧  阿斯加德
Tremble before me, Asgard!

1598
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:55,290
我是你的末日
I am your reckoning!

1599
01:56:03,910 --> 01:56:05,180
人民安全了
The people are safe.

1600
01:56:06,210 --> 01:56:07,260
那才是最重要的
That's all that matters.

1601
01:56:09,790 --> 01:56:11,470
我们实现了预言
We're fulfilling the prophecy.

1602
01:56:11,820 --> 01:56:13,030
我恨这则预言
I hate this prophecy.

1603
01:56:13,180 --> 01:56:15,150
我也是  但我们没别的办法
So do I, but we have no choice.

1604
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:16,910
苏尔特尔毁掉阿斯加德
Surtur destroys Asgard,

1605
01:56:16,910 --> 01:56:19,490
才能毁掉海拉  我们的人民才能生还
he destroys Hela, so that our people may live.

1606
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:22,160
但我们得让他做完  否则
But we need to let him finish the job, otherwise...

1607
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:25,260
不
No!

1608
01:56:27,650 --> 01:56:29,480
绿巨人  停下  你个白痴
Hulk, stop, you moron!

1609
01:56:38,590 --> 01:56:39,900
绿巨人  停下
Hulk, stop.

1610
01:56:39,900 --> 01:56:43,140
就这一次  别砸了
Just for once in your life, don't smash.

1611
01:56:43,950 --> 01:56:45,170
大怪物
Big monster!

1612
01:56:46,170 --> 01:56:47,110
我们走吧
Let's go!

1613
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:49,760
好吧
Fine.

1614
01:57:14,270 --> 01:57:17,230
我是阿斯加德的末日
I am Asgard's doom!

1615
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:42,030
毁得还不算太严重
The damage is not too bad.

1616
01:57:42,230 --> 01:57:44,440
只要地基还撑得住
As long as the foundations are still strong,

1617
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:46,220
我们还能重建
we can rebuild this place.

1618
01:57:46,670 --> 01:57:50,120
它可以成为全宇宙人民
It will become a haven for all peoples

1619
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:51,910
和外星人的避难所
and aliens of the universe.

1620
01:57:58,690 --> 01:58:00,910
这下地基是没了  抱歉
Now those foundations are gone. Sorry.

1621
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:17,350
我做了什么啊
What have I done?

1622
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:20,920
你让我们免遭灭绝
You saved us from extinction.

1623
01:58:21,830 --> 01:58:23,720
阿斯加德不是一个地方
Asgard is not a place...

1624
01:58:25,170 --> 01:58:26,160
是人民的所在
It's a people.

1625
01:58:55,910 --> 01:58:56,820
挺适合你
It suits you.

1626
01:59:00,270 --> 01:59:02,770
或许你也没那么坏  弟弟
Maybe you're not so bad after all, brother.

1627
01:59:03,350 --> 01:59:04,170
或许吧
Maybe not.

1628
01:59:05,590 --> 01:59:06,340
谢谢
Thank you.

1629
01:59:07,470 --> 01:59:09,350
如果你真在这里  我或许还会抱抱你
If you were here, I might even give you a hug.

1630
01:59:14,130 --> 01:59:14,870
我在这儿
I'm here.

1631
01:59:39,850 --> 01:59:40,580
你的王位
Your throne.

1632
01:59:56,150 --> 01:59:59,760
那么  阿斯加德国王
So, King of Asgard.

1633
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:10,640
我们去哪
Where to?

1634
02:00:12,130 --> 02:00:13,040
我不确定
I'm not sure.

1635
02:00:14,050 --> 02:00:15,180
有什么提议吗
Any suggestions?

1636
02:00:17,970 --> 02:00:19,870
米克  你是哪来的
Miek, where are you from?

1637
02:00:20,300 --> 02:00:21,250
米克死了
Miek's dead.

1638
02:00:22,110 --> 02:00:25,040
是啊  我刚刚在桥上不小心踩到了他
Yeah, no, I accidentally stomped on him on the bridge.

1639
02:00:25,250 --> 02:00:28,500
我好愧疚  我抱了他一天了
I've just felt so guilty, I've been carrying him around all day.

1640
02:00:30,850 --> 02:00:32,160
米克  你还活着
Miek, you're alive!

1641
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:34,740
他还活着  你刚问什么来着  哥们
He's alive, guys. What was your question again, bro?

1642
02:00:36,330 --> 02:00:37,360
去地球吧
Earth it is.

1643
02:02:54,250 --> 02:02:57,070
你真觉得回地球是个好主意吗
Do you really think it's a good idea to go back to Earth?

1644
02:02:57,310 --> 02:03:00,190
当然  地球人民喜欢我  我很受欢迎
Yes, of course. The people of Earth love me. I'm very popular.

1645
02:03:01,130 --> 02:03:02,670
我换个说法
Let me rephrase that.

1646
02:03:03,120 --> 02:03:06,660
你真觉得带我回地球是个好主意吗
Do you really think it's a good idea to bring me back to Earth?

1647
02:03:07,010 --> 02:03:08,580
老实说  或许不是
Probably not, to be honest.

1648
02:03:09,100 --> 02:03:10,470
别担心  弟弟
I wouldn't worry, brother.

1649
02:03:10,750 --> 02:03:12,850
我觉得一切都会没问题的
I feel like everything's gonna work out fine.

1650
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:43,890
天呐
Oh, boy.

1651
02:09:52,420 --> 02:09:55,820
我想说  我为你们所有人骄傲
I just gotta say, I'm proud of you all.

1652
02:09:56,770 --> 02:10:00,090
这场革命非常成功  大家好棒
This revolution has been a huge success. Yay, us!

1653
02:10:00,210 --> 02:10:02,880
鼓励鼓励自己  干得好
Pat on the back. Pat on the back.

1654
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:05,080
来嘛  不吗
Come on. No?

1655
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:07,670
我也是  因为我是其中重要的一部分
Me too. 'Cause I've been a big part of it.

1656
02:10:07,670 --> 02:10:10,500
没有人去推翻  哪里来的革命呢
Can't have a revolution without somebody to overthrow.

1657
02:10:10,580 --> 02:10:12,430
所以  不客气
So, you're welcome.

1658
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:15,170
我们平手了
And it's a tie.
