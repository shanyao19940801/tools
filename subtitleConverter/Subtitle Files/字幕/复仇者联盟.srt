3
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:31,366
宇宙立方已经苏醒
The Tesseract has awakened.

4
00:00:33,202 --> 00:00:38,159
它正在一个渺小世界里，人类的世界
It is on a little world, a human world.

5
00:00:38,874 --> 00:00:42,207
人类想利用它的能量
They would wield its power,

6
00:00:42,586 --> 00:00:48,256
他们不会成功只有我们的盟友才能利用它
but our ally knows its workings as they never will.

7
00:00:49,802 --> 00:00:52,885
他将作为先锋
He is ready to lead

8
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:58,517
而我们智塔利人大军将紧随其后
and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.

9
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:02,517
给他一个地球
A world will be his.

10
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:05,850
我们拥有宇宙
The universe, yours.

11
00:01:06,068 --> 00:01:11,940
至于人类，除了等死，还能做什么？
And the humans,what can they do but burn?

12
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:27,250
全体人员注意
All personnel,

13
00:01:27,423 --> 00:01:29,711
疏散命令已获确认
the evacuation order has been confirmed.

14
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:30,675


15
00:01:30,862 --> 00:01:33,051
（联合暗能量行动）
(DIRECTING AGENTS)

16
00:02:01,624 --> 00:02:03,081
情况有多糟糕？
How bad is it?

17
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:06,577
长官，最糟的就是我们不知道情况
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

18
00:02:10,174 --> 00:02:13,090
绍韦博士四小时前侦测到立方发出的能量波
Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago.

19
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:15,091
宇航局未批准绍韦进入测试阶段
NASA didn't authorise Selvig to go to test phase.

20
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:17,461
他没有测试，当时他根本不在房间里
He wasn't testing it.He wasn't even in the room.

21
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:18,676
是自动触发的
Spontaneous event.

22
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:19,963
宇宙立方自行启动？
It just turned itself on?

23
00:02:20,184 --> 00:02:21,214
现在的能级达到多少了？
Where are the energy levels now?

24
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:23,593
攀升中，绍韦没能把它停下来,我们因此下令撤离
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered evac.

25
00:02:23,813 --> 00:02:25,010
完全撤离还要多久？
How long to get everyone out?

26
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:26,558
半小时应该够了
Campus should be clear in the next half-hour.

27
00:02:26,774 --> 00:02:28,018
再快点
Do better.

28
00:02:28,984 --> 00:02:30,941
长官，撤离也许是徒劳无益的
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

29
00:02:31,153 --> 00:02:32,528
那我应该让他们都回去歇着？
We should tell them to go back to sleep?

30
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:34,944
如果我们无法控制宇宙立方的力量
If we can't control the Tesseract's energy,

31
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:37,481
也就不会有「安全距离」一说了
there may not be a minimum safe distance.

32
00:02:37,618 --> 00:02:40,445
你去确保二阶段原型机的安全转移
I need you to make sure the Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.

33
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,370


34
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:42,660
长官，真的要优先考虑它们？
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

35
00:02:42,873 --> 00:02:44,580
除非到世界末日
Until such time as the world ends,

36
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,747
否则我们就得这么来
we will act as though it intends to spin on.

37
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:49,086
把下面的设备都搬走
Clear out the tech below.

38
00:02:49,296 --> 00:02:51,786
二阶段原型机的每一个部件都要装车运走
Every piece of Phase 2 on a truck and gone.

39
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:53,086
遵命，长官
Yes, sir.

40
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:54,671
跟我来
With me.

41
00:02:57,763 --> 00:02:58,758
说说情况吧，博士
Talk to me, Doctor.

42
00:03:00,558 --> 00:03:01,932
局长
Director.

43
00:03:02,143 --> 00:03:03,802
我们确切知道的情况有哪些？
Is there anything we know for certain?

44
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,260
宇宙立方不大听话
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

45
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,266
- 你在开玩笑？- 不，我不是开玩笑
- Is that supposed to be funny? - No, it's not funny at all.

46
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:12,982
宇宙立方不仅被唤醒了，还在自行活动
The Tesseract is not only active, she's behaving.

47
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,189
拔了电源试试？
I assume you pulled the plug.

48
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:16,111
它自身是个能量源
She's an energy source.

49
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:19,358
我们关闭了电源，它又重新打开
We turn off the power,she turns it back on.

50
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:20,654
如果它能级达到峰值
If she reaches peak level...

51
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:24,284
博士，这不正是我们所需要的吗？利用宇宙的能量
We prepared for this, Doctor. Harnessing energy from space.

52
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:25,872
但是我们没办法控制
But we don't have the harness.

53
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:27,278
我们离利用还差得远呢
My calculations are far from complete.

54
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,371
它在释放干扰与辐射
And she's throwing off interference, radiation.

55
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:32,294
低能级的伽玛射线，没什么危害
Nothing harmful,low levels of gamma radiation.

56
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,040
也许会有危害
That can be harmful.

57
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:36,668
巴顿探员呢？
Where's Agent Barton?

58
00:03:36,843 --> 00:03:38,550
鹰眼？
The Hawk?

59
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:41,467
一如既往，在他的鹰巢里
Up in his nest, as usual.

60
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,723
巴顿探员，请回答
Agent Barton, report.

61
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:46,763
我让你来
I gave you this detail

62
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:48,471
是希望你能够近距离进行观察
so you could keep a close eye on things.

63
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:50,062
我站远点看得更清楚
Well, I see better from a distance.

64
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:52,229
你有看到什么东西激活它了吗？
Have you seen anything that might set this thing off?

65
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:54,814
博士，能量又达到峰值了
Doctor, it's spiking again.

66
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:56,402
没有人员进出
No one's come or gone.

67
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:58,236
绍韦也没问题
And Selvig's clean.

68
00:03:58,448 --> 00:04:00,736
没人与外界联系或传输信息
No contacts, no IMs.

69
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,033
如果有什么扰动，也不来自这端，长官
If there was any tampering, sir,it wasn't at this end.

70
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,329
「来自这端」？
"At this end"?

71
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:10,370
是啊，立方不是通往宇宙另一端的通道吗？
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right?

72
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:13,491
通道是双向的
Doors open from both sides.

73
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,583
还是不行…
Not yet.

74
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,509


75
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:20,511


76
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:26,610
先生，请把矛放下
Sir, please put down the spear.

77
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,293


78
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:36,754


79
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:39,007


80
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:40,425


81
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:45,263


82
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:47,098


83
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:04,949


84
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,111
你是有心之人
You have heart.

85
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,665


86
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,183
不要
Please don't.

87
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,181
我还要它呢
I still need that.

88
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,860
没必要把事情弄那么复杂
This doesn't have to get any messier.

89
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,268
当然有必要
Of course it does.

90
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,362
我不远万里，就是为了它
I've come too far for anything else.

91
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,112
我是来自亚斯加特的洛基
I am Loki, of Asgard

92
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,201
我肩负着光荣的使命
and I am burdened with glorious purpose.

93
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,825
洛基
Loki,

94
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,614
托尔的弟弟
brother of Thor.

95
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:01,290
你我族类毫无恩怨
We have no quarrel with your people.

96
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:04,458
蚂蚁与靴子也毫无恩怨
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

97
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,709
你也打算踩死我们？
Are you planning to step on us?

98
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,135
我给你们带来福音
I come with glad tidings

99
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,298
为整个世界带来解脱
of a world made free.

100
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:14,679
怎么解脱？
Free from what?

101
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,221
从自由中解脱
Freedom.

102
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,391
自由是生命中最大的谎言
Freedom is life's great lie.

103
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:23,021
当你内心接受了这观念
Once you accept that, in your heart,

104
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:25,363


105
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,404
你就将获得安宁
you will know peace.

106
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,154
你嘴上说「安宁」
Yeah, you say "peace,"

107
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,195
但我觉得你想表达的却恰恰相反
I kind of think you mean the other thing.

108
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,903
长官，霍利局长在拖延时间
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

109
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,451
这地方马上就要爆炸了
This place is about to blow

110
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,291
我们会被压在几十米的岩石下
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.

111
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,825
他想活埋了我们
He means to bury us.

112
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,160
像古代的法老一样
Like the pharaohs of old.

113
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,337
他说得对，传送门正在自我坍塌
He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself.

114
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,755
离临界状态只有两分钟了
We've got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.

115
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,131
好吧
Well, then.

116
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:51,973


117
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:06,981
我要用这些车
I need these vehicles.

118
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,196
- 那是谁？ - 我也不知道
- Who's that? - They didn't tell me.

119
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,657
希尔！
Hill!

120
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,361
能听到吗？
Do you CODY?

121
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:21,411
巴顿叛变了
Barton has turned.

122
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:22,879


123
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:37,307
他们拿走了宇宙立方！拦下他们！
They have the Tesseract! Shut them down!

124
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,219


125
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,925
快走，别管它了，快走！
Okay, let's go. No, leave it. Go!

126
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,527
楼上撤离完毕了，长官，你得走了
We're clear upstairs, sir. You need to go.

127
00:09:57,515 --> 00:09:58,516


128
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:26,752


129
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:53,404


130
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,826
局长？
Director?

131
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,660
霍利局长，能听到吗？
Director Fury, do you copy?

132
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,165
宇宙立方已落入敌手
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.

133
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,828
有人受伤，希尔，你那边呢？
I have men down. Hill?

134
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,047
还有很多人被埋
A lot of men still under.

135
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,967
不清楚有多少生还者
I don't know how many survivors.

136
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:20,339
发布命令
Sound a general call.

137
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,261
所有没参加救援工作的人员
I want every living soul not working rescue

138
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:23,384
都去寻找那个箱子
looking for that briefcase.

139
00:11:23,598 --> 00:11:24,629
收到
Roger that.

140
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,134
古逊，赶回基地，这是七级事件
Coulson, get back to base. This is a Level Seven.

141
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:30,806
我们的战争
As of right now,

142
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:32,480
就此开始
we are at war.

143
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:35,472
我们该做什么？
What do we do?

144
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:48,428
复仇者联盟

145
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,604


146
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,191


147
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:16,055
今晚没按照我的预想进行
This is not how I wanted this evening to go.

148
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:15,778


149
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,816
我知道你对今晚的预想
I know how you wanted this evening to go.

150
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,106
相信我
Believe me

151
00:12:19,237 --> 00:12:20,268
现实比预想好一点
this is better.

152
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,112
你现在为谁工作？
Who are you working for?

153
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,068
莱曼托夫吗？
Lermentov, yes?

154
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,495
他觉得
Does he think

155
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:30,913
我们需要他的允许
we have to go through him

156
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,665
才能运走我们的货物？
to move our cargo?

157
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,461
我还以为索罗霍布将军负责出口生意呢
I thought General Solohob is in charge of the export business.

158
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,755
索罗霍布
Solohob

159
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:43,006
只是中间人罢了
a bagman, a front.

160
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:49,634
过时的情报害了你
Your outdated information betrays you.

161
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,978
大名鼎鼎的黑寡妇
The famous Black Widow

162
00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:00,025
也不过是个漂亮的花瓶
and she turns out to be simply another pretty face.

163
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:04,070
你真觉得我很漂亮？
You really think I'm pretty?

164
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:08,859
告诉莱曼托夫我们货物的运输
Tell Lermentov we don't need him

165
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:12,744
还轮不到他来插手
to move the tanks.

166
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,329
他已是明日黄花了
Tell him he is out.

167
00:13:16,753 --> 00:13:18,377
不过
Well...

168
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,000
你也许只能用写的了
...you may have to write it down.

169
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:23,888


170
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,055


171
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:29,643


172
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,434
找她的
It's for her.

173
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:38,178
听仔细了
You listen carefully

174
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:40,889
你在114号萨伦斯基广场三楼
You're at 1-14 Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.

175
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,275
有架F22在八英里外待命
We have an F-22 exactly eight miles out.

176
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,112
让那女人接电话，否则不等你跑到大厅
Put the woman on the phone or I will blow up the block

177
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:48,363
我就炸平整条街
before you can make the lobby.

178
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,955
- 我们需要你回来 - 开玩笑哪？我在工作
- We need you to come in. - Are you kidding? I'm working.

179
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,448
这边情况更加危急
This takes precedence.

180
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,294
我都审问了一半了
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

181
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:02,253
那蠢货什么都招了
This moron is giving me everything.

182
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:05,293
我什么都没说啊
I don't give everything.

183
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:08,093
听好了，我现在走不开
Look, you can't pull me out of this right now.

184
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,215
娜塔莎
Natasha...

185
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:12,299
巴顿被精神控制了
Barton's been compromised.

186
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,345
稍等片刻
Let me put you on hold.

187
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:19,777


188
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,531


189
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,534


190
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,123


191
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:38,963


192
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:40,130


193
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:46,387


194
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:54,853


195
00:14:59,105 --> 00:15:00,099
巴顿人呢？
Where is Barton now?

196
00:15:00,272 --> 00:15:01,766
- 不知道   - 还活着吧？
- We don'tknow. - But he's alive?

197
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:04,769
应该是，等你回来再细说
We think so. I'll brief you on everything when you get back.

198
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:07,066
不过你得先和大块头聊聊
But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.

199
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,363
古逊你知道，相比他据我千里之外，史塔克更信任我
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me.

200
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:14,073
噢，我去找史塔克，你去找大块头
Oh, I've got Stark. You get the big guy.

201
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:18,335


202
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,385


203
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:37,605


204
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:38,606


205
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:39,806
你是谁？
Who are you?

206
00:15:40,271 --> 00:15:41,349
快出去！
Get out!

207
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,970
会传染的！
There is sickness here!

208
00:15:44,108 --> 00:15:45,103
你是医生吗？
You're a doctor.

209
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,113


210
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:48,098
我爸爸昏迷不醒了
My father's not waking up!

211
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:50,063
他发烧了，还一直呻吟
He has a fever and he's moaning

212
00:15:50,197 --> 00:15:51,275
但眼睛却睁不开
but his eyes won't open.

213
00:15:51,407 --> 00:15:52,402
慢点
Slow down.

214
00:15:53,951 --> 00:15:55,029
我爸爸
My father...

215
00:15:57,413 --> 00:15:58,408
像他们一样？
Like them?

216
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:01,170


217
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:03,662
求你了
Please.

218
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,054


219
00:16:30,863 --> 00:16:33,151
你该先收钱的，班纳
You should've got paid up front, Banner.

220
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:36,063
对一个需要远离压力的人来说
You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress

221
00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:39,534
你居然选择住在这种地方
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

222
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,495
我靠的并不是远离压力
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

223
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,198
那是靠什么，瑜伽？
Then what is it? Yoga?

224
00:16:47,378 --> 00:16:50,544
把我引到郊区，聪明的决定
You brought me to the edge of the city. Smart.

225
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:55,176
我猜我已被重兵包围了
I assume the whole place is surrounded.

226
00:16:55,637 --> 00:16:57,011
只有你我二人
Just you and me.

227
00:16:58,264 --> 00:17:00,303
你的小演员哪？
And your actress buddy?

228
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:02,473
她也是个间谍？那么小就入行了？
Is she a spy, too? They start that young?

229
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:04,138
我入行时也不大
I did.

230
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:05,384
你是谁？
Who are you?

231
00:17:05,605 --> 00:17:06,719
娜塔莎·罗曼诺夫
Natasha Romanoff.

232
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:11,395
你是来取我性命的吗，罗曼诺夫小姐？
Are you here to kill me, Ms. Romanoff?

233
00:17:11,611 --> 00:17:14,315
这可不是一般人能完成的任务
Because that's not going to work out for everyone.

234
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:16,985
当然不是，我是代表神盾局来的
No, of course not. I'm here on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

235
00:17:18,743 --> 00:17:20,236
神盾局
S.H.I.E.L.D.

236
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:23,033
他们怎么找到我的？
How did they find me?

237
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:24,830
我们一直关注着你，博士
We never lost you, Doctor.

238
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,036
只是保持了距离
We've kept our distance.

239
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:29,241
还帮你挡下了些不速之客
Even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent.

240
00:17:29,754 --> 00:17:30,749
为什么这样？
Why?

241
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,251
尼克·霍利似乎很信任你
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

242
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:35,090
但现在我们需要你的加入
But now we need you to come in.

243
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:37,925
如果我拒绝呢？
What if I say no?

244
00:17:38,138 --> 00:17:40,260
我会说服你的
I'll persuade you.

245
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:46,720
要是「另一个我」说不呢？
And what if the other guy says no?

246
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:49,062
你们已经一年多没出事了
You've been more than a year without an incident.

247
00:17:49,274 --> 00:17:51,846
你总想让这个纪录延续吧
I don't think you want to break that streak.

248
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,691
好吧，我并非时时刻刻都能控制住自己
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

249
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,946
博士，一场全球性的大灾变很可能就要降临
Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe.

250
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:03,904
这些正是我一直试图远离的
Well, those I actively try to avoid.

251
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:06,286
这东西
This

252
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:08,870
就是宇宙立方
is the Tesseract.

253
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:11,871
它有足以夷平整个地球的能量
It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.

254
00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:16,873
霍利想让我怎么做，把它吃了？
What does Fury want me to do, swallow it?

255
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:19,548
它被人夺走了，霍利希望你可以找到它
He wants you to find it. It's been taken.

256
00:18:20,388 --> 00:18:24,551
它释放的伽玛射线强度太弱 我们无法追踪
It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace.

257
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:27,684
没有人比你更懂伽玛射线了
There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do.

258
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:30,682
所以我才来找你
If there was, that's where I'd be.

259
00:18:31,274 --> 00:18:33,431
那么说，霍利不是派你来抓怪物的？
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

260
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:34,895
至少他没这么说
Not that he's told me.

261
00:18:35,111 --> 00:18:37,269
他什么都跟你说了？
And he tells you everything?

262
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:39,322
和霍利谈谈吧，他现在需要你
Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.

263
00:18:39,449 --> 00:18:40,479
需要把我关笼子里？
He needs me in a cage?

264
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:41,611
没人打算把你关在…
No one's going to put you in a...

265
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:42,779
别骗我了！
Stop lying to me!

266
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:43,916


267
00:18:46,998 --> 00:18:49,618
对不起，又失态了
I'm sorry. That was mean.

268
00:18:50,585 --> 00:18:52,742
我只是想看看你的反应
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

269
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:56,916
咱们好好说话
Why don't we do this the easy way

270
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,377
你也别用枪指着我
where you don't use that

271
00:18:58,593 --> 00:19:02,506
那家伙也就不会添乱
and the other guy doesn't make a mess.

272
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:04,586
好吗？
Okay?

273
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,927
娜塔莎？
Natasha?

274
00:19:12,607 --> 00:19:13,637
退后
Stand down.

275
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:16,150
一切顺利
We're good here.

276
00:19:17,987 --> 00:19:19,529
这叫「只有你我二人」
"Just you and me."

277
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:24,272
这有些过火了，局长
This is out of line, Director.

278
00:19:24,494 --> 00:19:26,901
你试图运用你不能控制的力量
You're dealing with forces you can't control.

279
00:19:27,329 --> 00:19:30,779
议员先生，你上过战场吗，真枪实弹的？
You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight?

280
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:33,786
你觉得绝对控制存在吗？
Did you feel an overabundance of control?

281
00:19:34,002 --> 00:19:37,370
你是说亚斯加特正与我们行星开战？
You're saying that this Asgard is declaring war on our planet?

282
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:40,126
不是亚斯加特，只是洛基
Not Asgard. Loki.

283
00:19:40,342 --> 00:19:43,128
肯定不止他一人，另一个呢？
He can't be working alone.What about the other one?

284
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:44,292
他的哥哥
His brother.

285
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,468
根据我们的情报，他并非我们的敌人
Our intelligence says Thor is not a hostile

286
00:19:46,682 --> 00:19:47,677
但他离我们太远
but he's worlds away.

287
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,640
我们也不能指望他帮忙
We can't depend on him to help, either.

288
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:50,763
全得看我们自己
It's up to us.

289
00:19:50,894 --> 00:19:53,515
这就是你需要全力研发第二阶段的原因
Which is why you should be focusing on Phase 2.

290
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:54,968
它正是为了应对这种…
It was designed for exactly this...

291
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,356
二阶段尚未完成，敌人已大军压境
Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.

292
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,152
我们需要应急反应部队
We need a response team.

293
00:20:00,362 --> 00:20:02,650
复仇者联盟计划早已停止
The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

294
00:20:02,865 --> 00:20:04,655
我不是说复仇者联盟
This isn't about the Avengers.

295
00:20:04,867 --> 00:20:05,980
我看过那份名单
We've seen the list.

296
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:08,407
你拥有世界上最精锐的特工组织
You're running the world's greatest covert security network

297
00:20:08,537 --> 00:20:10,160
却还要把人类的命运
and you're going to leave the fate of the human race

298
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,574
置于那群怪胎手中
to a handful of freaks.

299
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:13,615
人类的命运不会被握在任何人手中
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

300
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:16,039
我们确实需要应急反应部队
We need a response team.

301
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:18,999
他们也许性情孤僻，互有不合
These people may be isolated, unbalanced even

302
00:20:19,214 --> 00:20:23,377
但只要引导得当，他们正是我们现在最急需的
but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need.

303
00:20:23,677 --> 00:20:24,957
你确定？
You believe?

304
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:28,760
感情用事是赢不了战争的，局长
War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

305
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:32,807
当然，是士兵拼下来的
No, it's won by soldiers.

306
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,658


307
00:20:52,456 --> 00:20:54,246
时间不够了
There's not enough time.

308
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,999
我得让它落入海里
I got to put her in the water!

309
00:21:01,381 --> 00:21:02,412
你不是一个人在战斗
You won't be alone.

310
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:04,501
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

311
00:21:04,968 --> 00:21:06,130
这家伙竟然还活着！
This guy is still alive!

312
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,104


313
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:32,653
失眠了？
Trouble sleeping?

314
00:21:33,997 --> 00:21:36,666
我都睡了70年了，长官,早睡够了
I slept for 70 years, sir. I think I've had my fill.

315
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,123
那你应该出门庆祝一下，四处看看
Then you should be out,celebrating, seeing the world.

316
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,804
我被冰封期间，世界正处在战乱中
When I went under, the world was at war.

317
00:21:51,014 --> 00:21:52,840
等我醒来，他们说我们赢了
I wake up, they say we won.

318
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,100
却对我们的损失绝口不提
They didn't say what we lost.

319
00:21:55,686 --> 00:21:58,010
我们一路上也犯了不少错误
We've made some mistakes along the way.

320
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:00,098
最近就有一些
Some, very recently.

321
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,847
你是带着任务来的吗，长官？
Are you here with a mission, sir?

322
00:22:02,985 --> 00:22:03,980
是的
I am.

323
00:22:04,111 --> 00:22:05,770
想把我融入外面的世界？
Trying to get me back in the world?

324
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,939
想让你拯救外面的世界
Trying to save it.

325
00:22:12,618 --> 00:22:14,610
海德拉的秘密武器
HYDRA'S secret weapon.

326
00:22:13,184 --> 00:22:14,703


327
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:16,904
这是史塔在找你的时候
Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean

328
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,153
从海里捞上来的
when he was looking for you.

329
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,367
他和我们观点相同
He thought what we think.

330
00:22:20,626 --> 00:22:24,753
宇宙立方是人类开发利用永续能源的关键
The Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy.

331
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:29,045
这正是世界所需要的
That's something the world sorely needs.

332
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:31,715
谁把它夺走了？
Who took it from you?

333
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:33,339
洛基
He's called Loki.

334
00:22:33,556 --> 00:22:36,176
他远道而来
He's not from around here.

335
00:22:36,642 --> 00:22:40,050
如果你加入我们，还得给你补补课
There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in.

336
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,019
不是你不明白
The world has gotten even stranger

337
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:44,227
这世界变化快
than you already know.

338
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:47,306
我现在早见怪不怪了
At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me.

339
00:22:47,945 --> 00:22:49,604
你错了，我赌10美元
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

340
00:22:51,365 --> 00:22:55,238
任务报告放在你的公寓了
There's a debriefing packet waiting for you back at your apartment.

341
00:22:57,622 --> 00:22:59,530
关于宇宙立方的情况
Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract

342
00:22:59,665 --> 00:23:00,862
你有什么能告诉我们的吗？
that we ought to know now?

343
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:03,455
你们就不该把它捞出来
You should have left it in the ocean.

344
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:05,927


345
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:15,353


346
00:23:36,202 --> 00:23:39,072
我这边搞定了，剩下的就看你了
Good to go on this end. The rest is up to you.

347
00:23:39,288 --> 00:23:40,616
断开与输电线的连接了吗？
You disconnected the transmission lines?

348
00:23:40,748 --> 00:23:41,743
我们脱离了供电网络？
Are we off the grid?

349
00:23:41,874 --> 00:23:45,668
史塔大厦将成为能源自给的标志性建筑
Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy.

350
00:23:45,795 --> 00:23:49,161
前提是弦反应堆能够替代电网正常供电
Well, assuming the arc reactor takes over and it actually works.

351
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:50,828
没问题的
I assume.

352
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:52,337
点亮吧
Light her up.

353
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:59,843


354
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:58,885
看起来如何？
How does it look?

355
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:01,726
像圣诞节一样，但更有我的特色
Like Christmas, but with more me.

356
00:24:01,936 --> 00:24:03,678
我们得在普及公众意识上更进一步才行
We've got to go wider on the public awareness campaign.

357
00:24:03,896 --> 00:24:04,927
你得在传媒上多造势
You need to do some press.

358
00:24:05,565 --> 00:24:06,559
我明天就去华盛顿
I'm in DC tomorrow,

359
00:24:06,732 --> 00:24:08,226
为接下来三座大厦选址
I'm working on the zoning for the next three buildings.

360
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:10,606
小辣椒，别扫兴，我们期待这一刻已久
Pepper, you're killing me. The moment, remember?

361
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,850
尽情享受现在吧
Enjoy the moment.

362
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:13,233
进来我们一块享受吧
Get in here and I will.

363
00:24:16,576 --> 00:24:19,492
先生，神盾局的古逊探员来电
Sir, Agent Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D. is on the line.

364
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,074
说我在外面
I'm not in.

365
00:24:21,748 --> 00:24:23,027
我也的确在外面
I'm actually out.

366
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,510


367
00:24:30,256 --> 00:24:32,876
先生，他坚持要找你
Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

368
00:24:33,092 --> 00:24:35,843
长点骨气，佐维斯，我约会呢
Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.

369
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:43,344
能级保持稳定
Levels are holding steady, I think.

370
00:24:43,561 --> 00:24:45,718
那还用说，我亲自参与的
Of course they are. I was directly involved.

371
00:24:45,938 --> 00:24:47,100
这让我不得不考虑一个问题
Which brings me to my next question.

372
00:24:47,273 --> 00:24:49,229
当个天才感觉如何？
How does it feel to be a genius?

373
00:24:49,441 --> 00:24:51,682
看来我这辈子肯定没机会考虑这个问题了
Well, I really wouldn't know, now would I?

374
00:24:51,902 --> 00:24:56,397
别这样说，你可是我灵感的源泉
What do you mean? All this came from you.

375
00:24:56,615 --> 00:25:00,232
不，这才是一切的源泉
No, all this came from that.

376
00:25:00,452 --> 00:25:02,740
别太谦虚
Give yourself some credit. Please.

377
00:25:02,954 --> 00:25:04,745
史塔大厦就像你的孩子一样
Stark Tower is your baby.

378
00:25:04,956 --> 00:25:07,328
你有12%的功劳
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

379
00:25:07,793 --> 00:25:08,906
12%？
12%?

380
00:25:09,044 --> 00:25:10,157
15%，不能再多了
An argument can be made for 15.

381
00:25:10,295 --> 00:25:11,872
就12%还叫「我的孩子」？
12%? My baby?

382
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:13,665
毕竟所有的重活都是我干的
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

383
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,671
准确地说，重物都是我搬的
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

384
00:25:15,926 --> 00:25:18,167
对了，说说混乱的安保系统
And, sorry, but the security snafu?

385
00:25:18,303 --> 00:25:19,761
都怪你
- That was on you. - Oh.

386
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,005
- 我的私人电梯 - 你是说我们的电梯？
- My private elevator... - You mean our elevator?

387
00:25:22,224 --> 00:25:24,892
挤满了浑身臭汗的工人
...It was teeming with sweaty workmen.

388
00:25:25,102 --> 00:25:29,602
我会为刚才分功的评论付出代价的，对吧？
I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I?

389
00:25:30,065 --> 00:25:31,262
可没那么简单
It's not going to be that subtle.

390
00:25:31,483 --> 00:25:32,762
这么说吧
I'll tell you what.

391
00:25:32,984 --> 00:25:35,439
下一座大厦上将挂上「宝芝」的大名
The next building is gonna say "Potts" on the tower.

392
00:25:35,654 --> 00:25:37,028
还是写租约上吧
On the lease.

393
00:25:37,948 --> 00:25:40,070
打电话问你妈你能不能留下过夜
Call your mom. Can you bunk over?

394
00:25:40,283 --> 00:25:41,527
先生，您的电话
Sir, the telephone.

395
00:25:41,743 --> 00:25:44,114
我的规程被改写了
I'm afraid my protocols are being overridden.

396
00:25:44,329 --> 00:25:46,285
史塔先生，我有事找你
Mr. Stark, we need to talk.

397
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:48,906
你正在与东尼·史塔的仿生假体通话
You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark.

398
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:51,123
- 请留言 - 我有急事
- Please leave a message. - This is urgent.

399
00:25:51,336 --> 00:25:53,126
那就快点说
Then leave it urgently.

400
00:25:54,673 --> 00:25:55,786
安保漏洞，你的错
Security breach. It's on you.

401
00:25:56,007 --> 00:25:58,711
- 史塔先生 - 费尔，快请进
- Mr. Stark. - Phil! Come in.

402
00:25:58,885 --> 00:25:59,880
「费尔」？
"Phil"?

403
00:26:00,011 --> 00:26:01,042
我不能久留
I can't stay.

404
00:26:01,263 --> 00:26:02,460
他名叫「探员」
His first name is "Agent."

405
00:26:02,681 --> 00:26:04,304
快请进，我们正在庆祝
Come on in. We're celebrating.

406
00:26:04,516 --> 00:26:06,306
正因此他不能久留
Which is why he can't stay.

407
00:26:06,518 --> 00:26:08,474
请尽快阅读这些资料
We need you to look this over as soon as possible.

408
00:26:08,687 --> 00:26:09,717
我不喜欢别人递给我东西
I don't like being handed things.

409
00:26:09,938 --> 00:26:11,396
没事，我喜欢别人递给我东西
That's fine, because I love to be handed things.

410
00:26:11,606 --> 00:26:12,934
我们换一换
So, let's trade.

411
00:26:14,317 --> 00:26:15,811
谢谢你
Thank you.

412
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:20,359
正式咨询时间是每隔一周的 周四的早8点到下午5点
Official consulting hours are between 8 and 5 every other Thursday.

413
00:26:20,532 --> 00:26:21,527
我不是来咨询的
This isn't a consultation.

414
00:26:21,658 --> 00:26:22,902
是关于复仇者联盟？
Is this about the Avengers?

415
00:26:23,326 --> 00:26:25,152
我对此一无所知
Which I know nothing about.

416
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,907
我记得复仇者联盟计划早已废弃
The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought.

417
00:26:28,123 --> 00:26:29,497
我连入选资格都没有
And I didn't even qualify.

418
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:30,703
我也不大清楚
I didn't know that either.

419
00:26:30,876 --> 00:26:33,745
何况我反复无常，偏执自恋
Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed,

420
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:35,123
和他人难以相处
don't play well with others.

421
00:26:35,422 --> 00:26:36,417
这个我深有感触
That I did know.

422
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:38,172
现在没空管性格了
This isn't about personality profiles anymore.

423
00:26:38,341 --> 00:26:40,666
无所谓了，宝芝小姐，可以过来下吗？
Whatever. Ms. Potts, got a second?

424
00:26:40,886 --> 00:26:41,880
稍等
Half a mo.

425
00:26:47,184 --> 00:26:49,508
我还以为我们能共度良宵哪
You know, I thought we were having a moment.

426
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,304
我正在享受那12%的良宵
I was having 12% of a moment.

427
00:26:52,522 --> 00:26:54,977
事态看来挺严重的，费尔惊魂未定
This seems serious. Phil's pretty shaken.

428
00:26:55,192 --> 00:26:57,148
你知道那是…你怎么叫他费尔？
How would you know if it's... Why is he "Phil"?

429
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,103
这都是些什么？
What is all this?

430
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:00,862
这些是
This is

431
00:27:01,573 --> 00:27:02,568
看吧
this.

432
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:04,457


433
00:27:09,915 --> 00:27:11,289
我今晚就飞华盛顿
I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.

434
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:12,446
明天吧
Tomorrow.

435
00:27:12,584 --> 00:27:14,872
你资料要看，还不少呢
You have homework. You have a lot of homework.

436
00:27:15,087 --> 00:27:16,793
要是我不看呢？
Well, what if I didn't?

437
00:27:17,422 --> 00:27:18,797
- 你不看？- 是啊
- If you didn't? - Yeah.

438
00:27:19,007 --> 00:27:21,165
你是说你已经看完了？
You mean when you've finished?

439
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,545
那好吧
Well, then...

440
00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:32,048
就这么定了，一路顺风
Square deal. Fly safe.

441
00:27:36,273 --> 00:27:37,387
好好干
Work hard.

442
00:27:40,277 --> 00:27:42,020
去拉瓜迪亚机场顺路吗？
So, any chance you're driving by LaGuardia?

443
00:27:42,238 --> 00:27:44,988
- 我载你去吧 - 太棒了
- I can drop you. - Fantastic.

444
00:27:45,116 --> 00:27:46,110
说说那个大提琴手吧
I want to hear

445
00:27:46,242 --> 00:27:47,901
你们还有戏吗？
about the cellist. Is that still a thing?

446
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,232
她搬回波特兰了
She moved back to Portland.

447
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:52,572
真的吗？
What? BOO!

448
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:03,038
我们距基地还有40分钟航程，长官
We're about 40 minutes out from home base, sir.

449
00:28:06,762 --> 00:28:10,426
班纳博士想复制我曾注射的血清吗？
So, this Dr. Banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me?

450
00:28:10,641 --> 00:28:12,182
很多人都想
A lot of people were.

451
00:28:12,393 --> 00:28:14,016
你是世界上第一个超级英雄
You were the world's first superhero.

452
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:17,432
班纳认为破解艾斯金的原始配方的关键
Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking

453
00:28:17,606 --> 00:28:18,934
就在于伽玛射线
Erskine's original formula.

454
00:28:19,984 --> 00:28:21,358
只可惜事与愿违，不是吗？
Didn't really go his way, did it?

455
00:28:21,777 --> 00:28:23,235
差不多吧
Not so much.

456
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:26,280
不过他不变身的时候就像史蒂芬·霍金一样
When he's not that thing, though, the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

457
00:28:28,325 --> 00:28:30,862
我是指智力方面
He's like a smart person.

458
00:28:32,997 --> 00:28:34,110
说实话
I gotta say,

459
00:28:34,457 --> 00:28:36,863
十分荣幸能与你正式会面
it's an honour to meet you officially.

460
00:28:37,626 --> 00:28:39,120
我是，我以前也算见过你
I've sort of met you. I mean,

461
00:28:39,295 --> 00:28:41,085
是你还在沉睡的时候
I watched you while you were sleeping.

462
00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:45,129
你被发现冰封不醒时
I mean, I was present

463
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:48,627
我就在场
while you were unconscious from the ice.

464
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:51,134
你能加入我们
You know, it's really just a huge honour

465
00:28:51,265 --> 00:28:53,221
实在是太荣幸了
to have you on board this...

466
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:55,473
希望我可以胜任吧
I hope I'm the man for the job.

467
00:28:55,686 --> 00:28:58,556
你当然可以，绝对的
Oh, you are. Absolutely.

468
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:01,642
我们对你的战斗服做了些改动
We made some modifications to the uniform.

469
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:03,352
还采纳了些我的意见
I had a little design input.

470
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:04,813
战斗服？
The uniform?

471
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:07,519
那些星条旗图案…
Aren't the stars and stripes a little

472
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:10,027
是不是有些过时？
old-fashioned?

473
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:13,025
鉴于目前局势
With everything that's happening

474
00:29:13,245 --> 00:29:14,869
和未来可能发生的事情
and the things that are about to come to light,

475
00:29:15,748 --> 00:29:19,198
人们可能需要一些过去的美国精神
people might just need a little old-fashioned.

476
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:39,154


477
00:29:51,742 --> 00:29:54,695
智塔利人已经等不及了
The Chitauri grow restless.

478
00:29:54,912 --> 00:29:56,619
让他们做好战备吧
Let them gird themselves.

479
00:29:56,747 --> 00:29:58,538
我将引领他们打一场光荣的战役
I will lead them in the glorious battle.

480
00:29:58,749 --> 00:29:59,911
战役？
Battle?

481
00:30:00,751 --> 00:30:03,835
对付那些弱小的地球人？
Against the meagre might of Earth?

482
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:06,880
一场光荣的闪电战
Glorious, not lengthy.

483
00:30:07,091 --> 00:30:10,874
只要你的大军如你所言般强大
If your force is as formidable as you claim.

484
00:30:11,095 --> 00:30:13,585
你竟然质疑我们？
You question us?

485
00:30:13,806 --> 00:30:15,928
你质疑的人
You question him,

486
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:18,553
正是在你战败且遭受流放时
he who put the sceptre in your hand?

487
00:30:18,768 --> 00:30:21,685
授予你权杖
Who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose

488
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:24,766
并给予你远古知识与新的目标的人
when you were cast out, defeated?

489
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:26,855
我是国王
I was a king!

490
00:30:27,068 --> 00:30:29,274
亚斯加特的法定国王
The rightful king of Asgard,

491
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:30,774
可惜遭人背叛
betrayed.

492
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:34,068
你鼠目寸光
Your ambition is little

493
00:30:34,284 --> 00:30:37,034
满是幼稚之想
and born of childish need.

494
00:30:37,245 --> 00:30:39,237
我们放眼地球之外
We look beyond the Earth

495
00:30:39,456 --> 00:30:42,409
那些即将被宇宙立方开启的无垠星空
to the greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil.

496
00:30:42,876 --> 00:30:44,285
可惜宇宙立方还在我手上
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

497
00:30:47,088 --> 00:30:48,083
我可没有威胁你
I don't threaten.

498
00:30:49,632 --> 00:30:52,205
但只要传送门没有打开
But until I open the doors,

499
00:30:52,427 --> 00:30:56,044
你的大军没有归于我的麾下
until your force is mine to command,

500
00:30:56,806 --> 00:30:58,597
你的一切都只是空谈
you are but words.

501
00:30:58,808 --> 00:31:02,757
你会得到想要的战争的，亚斯加特人
You will have your war, Asgardian.

502
00:31:04,564 --> 00:31:06,556
如果你失败了
If you fail,

503
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:11,943
宇宙立方落入他人之手
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

504
00:31:12,155 --> 00:31:16,531
那将没有任何国家，任何星球
there will be no realm, no barren moon,

505
00:31:16,743 --> 00:31:20,027
哪怕一道裂隙供你躲藏
no crevice where he cannot find you.

506
00:31:21,623 --> 00:31:24,373
你知道苦痛的滋味吗？
You think you know pain?

507
00:31:24,584 --> 00:31:30,253
他会让你体验真正的痛不欲生
He will make you long for something sweet as pain.

508
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:31,641


509
00:31:59,452 --> 00:32:00,482
把美国队长的装备卸载下来
Stow the captain's gear.

510
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,615
遵命，长官
Yes, sir.

511
00:32:03,164 --> 00:32:06,283
罗曼诺夫探员，这位是罗杰斯队长
Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.

512
00:32:06,501 --> 00:32:07,780
- 你好，女士 - 你好
- Ma'am. - Hi.

513
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:08,956
他们在舰桥等着你
They need you on the bridge.

514
00:32:09,087 --> 00:32:10,580
他们开始面部识别追踪了
They're starting the face-trace.

515
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:11,875
回见
See you there.

516
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:17,760
你在冰中被发现可轰动一时呢
It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice.

517
00:32:18,054 --> 00:32:20,627
我以为古逊会乐晕了呢
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

518
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:23,718
他没让你在美国队长集换卡上签名？
Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?

519
00:32:23,935 --> 00:32:25,132
集换卡？
Trading cards?

520
00:32:25,353 --> 00:32:27,511
珍藏版的，他可引以为傲呢
They're vintage. He's very proud.

521
00:32:29,274 --> 00:32:30,553
班纳博士
Dr. Banner.

522
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:33,848
你好啊
Yeah, hi.

523
00:32:34,404 --> 00:32:35,601
我听说你会过来
They told me you would be coming.

524
00:32:35,822 --> 00:32:37,101
他们说你能找到那立方
Word is, you can find the Cube.

525
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:40,030
就说了这些？
Is that the only word on me?

526
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:41,613
我就关心这些
Only word I care about.

527
00:32:44,205 --> 00:32:46,790
这些一定让你倍感陌生吧
It must be strange for you, all of this.

528
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,169
其实，我倒觉得似曾相识
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

529
00:32:50,378 --> 00:32:52,951
先生们，你们最好赶紧进去
Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute.

530
00:32:53,173 --> 00:32:55,923
这儿马上就难以呼吸了
It's going to get a little hard to breathe.

531
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:58,717
空勤人员，请清空甲板
Flight crew, secure the deck.

532
00:33:03,223 --> 00:33:04,800
这是潜艇吗？
Is this a submarine?

533
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,345
真的？
Really?

534
00:33:06,477 --> 00:33:10,224
想把我关在水下加压的金属管子里？
They want me in a submerged, pressurised, metal container?

535
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:30,593


536
00:33:36,632 --> 00:33:39,003
不，好像更糟
No, no, this is much worse.

537
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:59,414


538
00:34:08,831 --> 00:34:11,534
悬停能量检查完毕，供给稳定
Hover power check complete. Position cyclic.

539
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,157
动力增至8%
Increase collective to 8.0%.

540
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:21,545
准备全速启航
Preparing for maximum performance takeoff.

541
00:34:21,677 --> 00:34:23,170
输出功率调至最高
Increase output to capacity.

542
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:25,467
动力性能已达上限
Power plant performing at capacity.

543
00:34:25,681 --> 00:34:27,139
准备完毕
We are clear.

544
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:28,842
全部引擎运转正常
All engines operating.

545
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:33,685
神盾局193.6号应急规程已启动
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency Protocol 193.6 in effect.

546
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:36,476
- 已到达预定高度，长官 - 很好
- We are at level, sir. - Good.

547
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:37,853
我们消失吧
Let's vanish.

548
00:34:38,068 --> 00:34:40,475
开启光线反射板
Engage retro-reflection panels.

549
00:34:56,253 --> 00:34:57,415
光线反射板开启完毕
Reflection panels engaged.

550
00:34:58,046 --> 00:34:59,421
先生们
Gentlemen.

551
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:12,882
感谢你的到来，博士
Doctor, thank you for coming.

552
00:35:14,897 --> 00:35:16,769
多谢你的善意邀请
Thanks for asking nicely.

553
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:19,602
那我要在这呆多久？
So, how long am I staying?

554
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:21,609
等我们拿到宇宙立方
Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,

555
00:35:21,737 --> 00:35:22,934
你就可以走了
you're in the wind.

556
00:35:23,071 --> 00:35:24,897
你那边有何进展？
Where are you with that?

557
00:35:25,115 --> 00:35:26,858
我们在扫描地球上每一个
We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible

558
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:27,987
连接到无线网络的摄像头
camera on the planet.

559
00:35:28,577 --> 00:35:30,367
手机，笔记本电脑…
Cell phones, laptops...

560
00:35:30,913 --> 00:35:34,197
只要它连上了卫星，就成了我们的眼线
If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us.

561
00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:35,660
这样还是无法及时找到他们
That's still not gonna find them in time.

562
00:35:35,876 --> 00:35:36,871
你得缩小搜寻范围
You have to narrow your field.

563
00:35:37,086 --> 00:35:39,042
你们有多少光谱仪可用？
How many spectrometers do you have access to?

564
00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:40,877
- 你要多少？ - 通知所有可以联系上的实验室
- How many are there? - Call every lab you know.

565
00:35:41,089 --> 00:35:42,795
让他们把光谱仪放在房顶
Tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof

566
00:35:42,924 --> 00:35:44,381
调整成接收伽玛射线的状态
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

567
00:35:44,592 --> 00:35:47,794
我会草拟一个聚类识别的追踪算法
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition.

568
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,502
最少能排除一些区域
At least we could rule out a few places.

569
00:35:50,765 --> 00:35:52,555
能给我找个干活的地方吗？
Do you have somewhere for me to work?

570
00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:53,922
罗曼诺夫探员
Agent Romanoff,

571
00:35:54,102 --> 00:35:56,342
能把班纳博士带到他的实验室去吗？
could you show Dr. Banner to his laboratory, please?

572
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,721
你会喜欢的，博士，那儿应有尽有
You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.

573
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:02,065
放那边去
Put it over there.

574
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,913


575
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,192
你从哪找的这些人？
Where did you find all these people?

576
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:09,358
神盾局树敌无数，博士
S.H.I.E.L.D. has no shortage of enemies, Doctor.

577
00:36:09,826 --> 00:36:10,904
这是你需要的材料吗？
Is this the stuff you need?

578
00:36:11,077 --> 00:36:12,072
是啊，铱
Yeah, iridium.

579
00:36:12,245 --> 00:36:14,865
陨石里找的，它可以产生反质子
It's found in meteorites. It forms anti-protons.

580
00:36:15,081 --> 00:36:16,704
这东西很难搞到
It's very hard to get hold of.

581
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:18,457
如果神盾局知道你需要它，就更难了
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D. knows you need it.

582
00:36:18,668 --> 00:36:20,042
这我就不知道了
Well, I didn't know.

583
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,430
Hey!

584
00:36:21,671 --> 00:36:23,959
宇宙立方向我展现了太多
The Tesseract has shown me so much.

585
00:36:24,424 --> 00:36:26,332
不止是知识，更是真理
It's more than knowledge. It's truth.

586
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:27,462
我知道
I know.

587
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:30,211
你看到了什么，巴顿探员？
What did it show you, Agent Barton?

588
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,590
我的下一个目标
My next target.

589
00:36:32,765 --> 00:36:33,760
告诉我你需要些什么
Tell me what you need.

590
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,096
引开他们的注意力
I need a distraction.

591
00:36:40,022 --> 00:36:41,432
和能通过视网膜扫描的眼球
And an eyeball.

592
00:36:48,197 --> 00:36:50,734
如果…不是太麻烦的话
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

593
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,980
没事，不麻烦
No, no. It's fine.

594
00:36:55,037 --> 00:36:56,614
那是套珍藏版
It's a vintage set.

595
00:36:56,831 --> 00:36:59,119
花了我好几年才收集齐
It took me a couple of years to collect them all.

596
00:37:01,669 --> 00:37:02,747
全新的
Near mint.

597
00:37:02,962 --> 00:37:04,336
边角有些泛黄，不过…
Slight foxing around the edges, but...

598
00:37:04,547 --> 00:37:07,167
发现疑似目标，吻合度67%
We got a hit. A 67% match.

599
00:37:07,675 --> 00:37:09,299
等等，交叉匹配，吻合度79%
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

600
00:37:10,303 --> 00:37:11,298
位置在哪？
Location?

601
00:37:11,471 --> 00:37:14,506
德国斯图加特国王大街28号
Stuttgart, Germany. 28 Königstrasse.

602
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:15,968
他就没打算躲起来
He's not exactly hiding.

603
00:37:16,184 --> 00:37:17,297
队长
Captain,

604
00:37:17,643 --> 00:37:18,638
看你的了
you're up.

605
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:30,791


606
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,085


607
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:00,738


608
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,933


609
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,400


610
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:44,365


611
00:38:58,045 --> 00:38:59,171


612
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:01,757


613
00:39:08,068 --> 00:39:10,597
（视网膜扫瞄… 通过认证 解锁）

614
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,862


615
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:44,383


616
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:46,135


617
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:53,267


618
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:55,288
给我跪下
Kneel before me.

619
00:39:59,763 --> 00:40:01,042
我说了
I said

620
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,651


621
00:40:03,141 --> 00:40:05,299
跪下！
kneel!

622
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:17,979
早这样不就好了？
Is not this simpler?

623
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:22,735
这不正是你们的本性？
Is this not your natural state?

624
00:40:25,038 --> 00:40:28,240
这是关于人性无人道破的真理
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

625
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:30,829
渴望被奴役
that you crave subjugation.

626
00:40:31,378 --> 00:40:35,161
自由那看似光鲜的诱惑吞噬了生活的乐趣
The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy

627
00:40:35,382 --> 00:40:37,954
热衷于追求权力
in a mad scramble for power,

628
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:41,177
沉溺于渴望认同
for identity.

629
00:40:42,848 --> 00:40:46,180
你们生来就该被奴役
You were made to be ruled.

630
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,433
到头来
In the end,

631
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:50,975
你们还是会臣服
you will always kneel.

632
00:40:58,363 --> 00:41:00,319
不会向你这种人臣服的
Not to men like you.

633
00:41:01,366 --> 00:41:03,274
你再也找不出第二个我了
There are no men like me.

634
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,029
你这种人多了
There are always men like you.

635
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,156
看看这老家伙
Look to your elder, people.

636
00:41:12,376 --> 00:41:13,786
就让他做你们的反面教材吧
Let him be an example.

637
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:16,559


638
00:41:20,593 --> 00:41:23,165
你看，上次我来德国
You know, the last time I was in Germany,

639
00:41:23,387 --> 00:41:26,553
就有一个人凌驾于众人之上
and saw a man standing above everybody else,

640
00:41:26,766 --> 00:41:28,223
我们就不欢而散
we ended up disagreeing.

641
00:41:28,434 --> 00:41:30,390
美国大兵
The soldier.

642
00:41:32,438 --> 00:41:33,682
过时的家伙
The man out of time.

643
00:41:34,273 --> 00:41:35,517
至少我不是快要死的那个
I'm not the one who's out of time.

644
00:41:39,028 --> 00:41:41,565
洛基，放下武器，立即投降
Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.

645
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:43,460


646
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:48,340


647
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:55,973


648
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:58,100


649
00:42:01,926 --> 00:42:03,502
跪下
Kneel.

650
00:42:03,636 --> 00:42:05,046
不可能
- Not today!

651
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:08,419
他的分身到处都是
The guy's all over the place.

652
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:10,362


653
00:42:11,936 --> 00:42:14,260
罗曼诺夫探员，想我了没？
Agent Romanoff. You miss me?

654
00:42:14,737 --> 00:42:15,416
（系统被改写）

655
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:24,919


656
00:42:30,996 --> 00:42:33,071
出招吧，小驯鹿
Make your move, Reindeer Games.

657
00:42:41,132 --> 00:42:42,589
这才乖
Good move.

658
00:42:44,093 --> 00:42:45,372
史塔先生
Mr. Stark.

659
00:42:46,053 --> 00:42:47,215
队长
Captain.

660
00:42:54,437 --> 00:42:56,060
他说什么了吗？
Is he saying anything?

661
00:42:56,272 --> 00:42:57,516
什么都不说
Not a word.

662
00:42:57,815 --> 00:42:59,723
把他带回来，我们时间不多了
Just get him here. We're low on time.

663
00:43:02,778 --> 00:43:03,773
有些不对劲
I don't like it.

664
00:43:04,155 --> 00:43:06,111
怎么，因为邪神大人如此轻易的投降？
What, Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

665
00:43:06,323 --> 00:43:07,982
我觉得没那么简单
I don't remember it being that easy.

666
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,616
这家伙挺厉害的
This guy packs a wallop.

667
00:43:09,827 --> 00:43:13,409
不过你那么大年纪功夫也挺不错的
Still, you are pretty spry for an older fellow.

668
00:43:14,457 --> 00:43:16,033
保持健康的秘诀是什么，做普拉提？
What's your thing, Pilates?

669
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:17,203
什么？
What?

670
00:43:17,376 --> 00:43:18,371
和健美操差不多
It's like calisthenics.

671
00:43:18,502 --> 00:43:20,541
你在当冰棍队长的时候
You might have missed a couple of things

672
00:43:20,755 --> 00:43:22,378
错过了很多事情
doing time as a Capsicle.

673
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,876
霍利没说他也叫你了
Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.

674
00:43:26,093 --> 00:43:28,963
是啊，霍利没说的事多了
Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.

675
00:43:29,346 --> 00:43:30,923
怎么打雷了？
Where's this coming from?

676
00:43:35,019 --> 00:43:37,591
怎么了？你还怕打雷？
What's the matter? Are you scared of a little lightning?

677
00:43:38,022 --> 00:43:40,310
我只是不喜欢随之而来的家伙
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

678
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:57,761


679
00:43:58,124 --> 00:43:59,286
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

680
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:04,393


681
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:12,234


682
00:44:12,222 --> 00:44:13,679
半路杀出了这家伙
And now there's that guy.

683
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:15,632
又一个亚斯加特人？
Another Asgardian?

684
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:17,676
- 他是自己人吗？ - 这无关紧要
- That guy's a friendly? - Doesn't matter.

685
00:44:17,894 --> 00:44:20,466
无论他杀了洛基或是放了他宇宙立方就找不到了
If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost.

686
00:44:20,688 --> 00:44:22,514
史塔，我们需要攻击计划
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

687
00:44:22,732 --> 00:44:25,020
我有个计划，攻击
I have a plan. Attack.

688
00:44:31,032 --> 00:44:32,823
要是我可不管这闲事，队长
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

689
00:44:33,034 --> 00:44:34,029
我可做不到
I don't see how I can.

690
00:44:34,244 --> 00:44:36,864
他们都是从神域而来基本上就是神
These guys come from legend. They're basically gods.

691
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:38,610
世上只有上帝一个神，女士
There's only one God, ma'am.

692
00:44:38,748 --> 00:44:41,119
而且他才不会打扮成那样
And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.

693
00:44:52,191 --> 00:44:53,734


694
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:56,236


695
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:57,974
宇宙立方在哪？
Where is the Tesseract?

696
00:44:58,184 --> 00:44:59,464
我也很想念你
I missed you, too.

697
00:44:59,686 --> 00:45:01,353
我像是跟你开玩笑的吗？
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

698
00:45:02,063 --> 00:45:03,437
你应该感谢我
You should thank me.

699
00:45:03,898 --> 00:45:05,937
彩虹桥已毁，奥丁汇聚了多少暗能
With the Bifrost gone, how much dark energy

700
00:45:06,151 --> 00:45:08,901
才把你传送到
did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here

701
00:45:09,112 --> 00:45:10,486
你心爱的地球上？
to your precious Earth?

702
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:12,169


703
00:45:14,617 --> 00:45:15,897
我还以为你死了
I thought you dead.

704
00:45:17,537 --> 00:45:18,947
你为我哀悼了？
Did you mourn?

705
00:45:19,414 --> 00:45:21,204
我们都哀悼了，我们的父王…
We all did. Our father...

706
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:24,457
你的父王
Your father.

707
00:45:26,337 --> 00:45:29,207
他把我的身世告诉你了，不是吗？
He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?

708
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,000
我们从小一块长大
We were raised together.

709
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,841
一起嬉戏，一同打闹
We played together, we fought together.

710
00:45:37,348 --> 00:45:38,546
你都不记得了吗？
Do you remember none of that?

711
00:45:38,767 --> 00:45:40,723
我只记得阴影
I remember a shadow.

712
00:45:42,228 --> 00:45:45,264
我活在你伟大所投射的阴影中
Living in the shade of your greatness.

713
00:45:45,982 --> 00:45:48,602
我无法忘记你把我扔下深渊
I remember you tossing me into an abyss.

714
00:45:48,735 --> 00:45:50,726
王位是我的，也应该由我来继承
I, who was, and should be, king!

715
00:45:50,945 --> 00:45:53,020
所以你践踏我心爱的世界
So you take the world I love as a recompense

716
00:45:53,156 --> 00:45:54,982
以补偿你所遭受的怠慢？
for your imagined slights?

717
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,283
不，地球在我的庇护之下，洛基
No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki.

718
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,591


719
00:45:59,704 --> 00:46:03,238
你保护得可真好啊
And you're doing a marvellous job with that.

720
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:05,664
人们成群结队地彼此厮杀
The humans slaughter each other in droves

721
00:46:05,794 --> 00:46:07,584
你却在一旁干着急
while you idly fret.

722
00:46:07,796 --> 00:46:09,953
我要统治他们，难道有错吗？
I mean to rule them, as why should I not?

723
00:46:10,173 --> 00:46:11,714
你自认高他们一等？
You think yourself above them?

724
00:46:12,801 --> 00:46:13,795
那当然
Well, yes.

725
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,465
那你就没懂得统治的真谛，弟弟
Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother.

726
00:46:17,305 --> 00:46:18,679
王位并不适合你
A throne would suit you ill.

727
00:46:23,895 --> 00:46:26,646
我见过许多你未知的世界
I've seen worlds you've never known about!

728
00:46:26,856 --> 00:46:31,019
奥丁逊，在流放途中，我已成长
I have grown, Odinson, in my exile.

729
00:46:31,401 --> 00:46:33,358
我见识了宇宙立方的真正力量
I have seen the true power of the Tesseract,

730
00:46:33,487 --> 00:46:34,565
等我拥有了它…
and when I wield it...

731
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,522
谁向你展示了它的力量？
Who showed you this power?

732
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:39,027
是谁在背后操纵着你这个国王迷？
Who controls the would-be king?

733
00:46:39,243 --> 00:46:41,033
- 我就是国王！- 别妄想了！
- I am a king! - Not here!

734
00:46:41,245 --> 00:46:42,524
交出宇宙立方！
You give up the Tesseract!

735
00:46:42,663 --> 00:46:45,200
放下痴心妄想！
You give up this poisonous dream!

736
00:46:47,918 --> 00:46:49,292
跟我回家
You come home.

737
00:46:54,258 --> 00:46:55,371
不在我手上
I don't have it.

738
00:46:57,469 --> 00:46:59,260
你需要立方来带我回去
You need the Cube to bring me home.

739
00:46:59,388 --> 00:47:01,712
但我把它转移了，我也不知道在哪
But I've sent it off, I know not where.

740
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:04,675
听好了，弟弟
You listen well, brother.

741
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,158


742
00:47:06,645 --> 00:47:07,842
我听着哪
I'm listening.

743
00:47:12,748 --> 00:47:13,916


744
00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:18,648
不许再碰我了
Do not touch me again.

745
00:47:18,866 --> 00:47:20,442
那你也别拿我东西
Then don't take my stuff.

746
00:47:20,659 --> 00:47:22,900
我看你是不知道厉害
You have no idea what you're dealing with.

747
00:47:24,788 --> 00:47:25,783
这是中央公园的莎翁戏剧节吗？
Shakespeare in the Park?

748
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:30,284
取帘为氅，令堂知否？
Doth Mother know you wear-eth her drapes?

749
00:47:30,544 --> 00:47:33,295
这不关你的事，铁皮人
This is beyond you, metal man.

750
00:47:33,505 --> 00:47:35,627
洛基将面临亚斯加特律法的审判
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

751
00:47:35,841 --> 00:47:39,209
让他把立方交出来，他就归你了在此之前
He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then,

752
00:47:39,595 --> 00:47:40,839
最好别碍事
stay out of the way.

753
00:47:42,389 --> 00:47:44,013
你个外域来客
- Tourist.

754
00:47:46,073 --> 00:47:47,282


755
00:47:49,396 --> 00:47:50,426
好吧
Okay.

756
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:02,422


757
00:48:09,263 --> 00:48:10,681


758
00:48:13,684 --> 00:48:14,685


759
00:48:17,688 --> 00:48:19,273


760
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:23,135
能量达到400%
Power at 400% capacity.

761
00:48:23,347 --> 00:48:24,888
尝尝这个
How about that?

762
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:33,495


763
00:48:46,341 --> 00:48:47,509


764
00:48:53,557 --> 00:48:56,643


765
00:48:57,936 --> 00:48:58,937


766
00:49:06,236 --> 00:49:07,237


767
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:14,077


768
00:49:15,704 --> 00:49:16,705


769
00:49:20,417 --> 00:49:21,418


770
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:26,214
Hey!

771
00:49:28,953 --> 00:49:30,150
够了没
That's enough.

772
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:35,748
我不知道你来此有何目的
Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.

773
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,248
我来这里终结洛基的阴谋
I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes.

774
00:49:38,463 --> 00:49:41,000
用行动说话，把锤子放下
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.

775
00:49:41,132 --> 00:49:42,127
啊…不行
Yeah... No.

776
00:49:42,383 --> 00:49:43,841
这可不是个好主意，他爱死他的锤子了
Bad call. He loves his hammer.

777
00:49:44,066 --> 00:49:45,067


778
00:49:45,428 --> 00:49:47,669
想让我放下锤子？
You want me to put the hammer down?

779
00:49:54,076 --> 00:49:55,661


780
00:50:02,918 --> 00:50:04,169


781
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:16,700
打够了没？
Are we done, here?

782
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:01,727


783
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:07,543
先跟你说清楚了
In case it's unclear,

784
00:51:08,261 --> 00:51:10,051
如果你想逃跑
if you try to escape,

785
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:13,426
哪怕轻轻挠那玻璃一下
if you so much as scratch that glass,

786
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:17,325


787
00:51:23,025 --> 00:51:26,974
你就会随着这监牢从万米高空坠落
it's 30,000 feet straight down in a steel trap.

788
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:29,652
懂了吗？
You get how that works?

789
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:34,321
你是蚂蚁，我是靴子
Ant, boot.

790
00:51:34,426 --> 00:51:36,511


791
00:51:37,665 --> 00:51:39,408
这笼子可真不错
It's an impressive cage.

792
00:51:40,334 --> 00:51:42,955
不过，不是为我建造的吧
Not built, I think, for me.

793
00:51:43,337 --> 00:51:45,744
它是为个比你强大得多的东西建的
Built for something a lot stronger than you.

794
00:51:45,965 --> 00:51:47,838
我有所耳闻
Oh, I've heard.

795
00:51:48,843 --> 00:51:50,005
一头愚蠢的野兽
A mindless beast.

796
00:51:51,012 --> 00:51:52,635
还假装自己是普通人
Makes play he's still a man.

797
00:51:53,722 --> 00:51:55,963
你该有多绝望
How desperate are you,

798
00:51:56,183 --> 00:51:59,266
才会找来这种怪胎作援兵？
that you call on such lost creatures to defend you?

799
00:51:59,478 --> 00:52:01,802
我有多绝望？
How desperate am I?

800
00:52:02,022 --> 00:52:03,812
你以战争威胁我们的世界
You threaten my world with war.

801
00:52:04,024 --> 00:52:06,146
你窃取自己无法掌控的能量
You steal a force you can't hope to control.

802
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:10,142
你嘴边挂着安宁，却以挥舞手中屠刀为乐
You talk about peace, and you kill because it's fun.

803
00:52:10,363 --> 00:52:13,363
你逼我孤注一掷
You have made me very desperate.

804
00:52:13,575 --> 00:52:15,483
你会为你的所作所为后悔的
You might not be glad that you did.

805
00:52:15,884 --> 00:52:17,177
噢
Ooh.

806
00:52:18,747 --> 00:52:22,031
功亏一篑让你无比痛苦吧
It burns you to have come so close.

807
00:52:23,502 --> 00:52:26,205
获取宇宙立方，拥有其中能量
To have the Tesseract, to have power,

808
00:52:27,005 --> 00:52:29,210
无尽的能量
unlimited power.

809
00:52:29,424 --> 00:52:31,380
用来干什么？
And for what?

810
00:52:33,762 --> 00:52:36,845
点起照亮人类前路的明灯
A warm light for all mankind to share.

811
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:40,348
然后认识到真正力量的本来面目
And then to be reminded what real power is.

812
00:52:44,439 --> 00:52:48,732
如果真正力量想要看杂志解闷，记得跟我说
Well, let me know if "real power" wants a magazine or something.

813
00:52:57,077 --> 00:52:58,535
你都看他看入迷了吧
He really grows on you, doesn't he?

814
00:52:58,745 --> 00:53:00,653
洛基是在拖延时间
Loki's gonna drag this out.

815
00:53:00,872 --> 00:53:04,323
托尔，他到底想干什么？
So, Thor, what's his play?

816
00:53:04,543 --> 00:53:07,080
他拥有一支智塔利大军
He has an army called the Chitauri.

817
00:53:07,295 --> 00:53:10,212
他们并非来自亚斯加特或任何已知的世界
They're not of Asgard, nor any world known.

818
00:53:10,632 --> 00:53:12,707
洛基想带领他们攻打地球
He means to lead them against your people.

819
00:53:12,926 --> 00:53:14,503
他们将助洛基夺取地球
They will win him the Earth,

820
00:53:14,636 --> 00:53:16,426
而我想洛基会将宇宙立方交给他们
in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

821
00:53:16,638 --> 00:53:18,380
来自外太空的
An army

822
00:53:18,598 --> 00:53:20,257
大军
from outer space.

823
00:53:20,475 --> 00:53:22,882
那么他正在建立另一个传送门
So, he's building another portal.

824
00:53:23,103 --> 00:53:24,430
这就是他带走艾力·绍韦的原因
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

825
00:53:24,563 --> 00:53:25,557
绍韦？
Selvig?

826
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:28,055
- 他是位天体物理学家 - 我的朋友
- He's an astrophysicist. - He's a friend.

827
00:53:28,275 --> 00:53:30,397
洛基用某种魔法控制了他
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

828
00:53:30,569 --> 00:53:32,062
还有我们的一位探员
along with one of ours.

829
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:33,855
洛基为何如此轻易的束手就擒
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

830
00:53:33,989 --> 00:53:35,268
他在这无法领导任何大军
He's not leading an army from here.

831
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:37,197
我觉得不应该把注意力集中在洛基身上
I don't think we should be focusing on Loki.

832
00:53:37,409 --> 00:53:39,199
他的想法难以捉摸
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

833
00:53:39,327 --> 00:53:40,607
可以说就是个疯子
You could smell crazy on him.

834
00:53:40,829 --> 00:53:42,571
说话注意点
Have care how you speak.

835
00:53:43,123 --> 00:53:45,328
尽管洛基蛮不讲理，但他还是亚斯加特人
Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard.

836
00:53:45,751 --> 00:53:46,829
也是我的弟弟
And he is my brother.

837
00:53:47,043 --> 00:53:48,916
他在两天内杀了80个人
He killed 80 people in two days.

838
00:53:49,796 --> 00:53:50,791
不是亲弟弟
He's adopted.

839
00:53:50,964 --> 00:53:53,252
让我们往机械上想想吧
I think it's about the mechanics.

840
00:53:53,467 --> 00:53:55,423
铱，他们要铱干什么？
Iridium... What do they need the iridium for?

841
00:53:55,635 --> 00:53:56,630
铱是一种稳定剂
It's a stabilising agent.

842
00:53:56,803 --> 00:53:58,083
我是说，随便那个周末
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

843
00:53:58,221 --> 00:53:59,762
我开飞机载你去波特兰
I'll fly you to Portland.

844
00:53:59,973 --> 00:54:01,514
多培养一下情感
Keep love alive.

845
00:54:01,725 --> 00:54:05,594
这样传送门就不会像神盾局的那个一样自我坍塌了
It means the portal won't collapse on itself like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

846
00:54:05,812 --> 00:54:09,097
不打不相识，你那一下真狠
No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing.

847
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:11,557
同时铱还可以让洛基根据需要
Also, it means the portal can open as wide

848
00:54:11,777 --> 00:54:14,183
把传送门开得更大，持续时间更长
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

849
00:54:14,905 --> 00:54:17,110
升起后桅，全速启航
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

850
00:54:18,825 --> 00:54:20,022
那人在玩「小蜜蜂」
That man is playing Galaga.

851
00:54:21,078 --> 00:54:24,446
他自以为别人看不到，但被我发现了
He thought we wouldn't notice, but we did.

852
00:54:26,416 --> 00:54:27,791
霍利的视线如何兼顾两侧？
How does Fury even see these?

853
00:54:27,959 --> 00:54:28,954
他会转身
He turns.

854
00:54:29,252 --> 00:54:30,876
那多累啊
Sounds exhausting.

855
00:54:31,963 --> 00:54:33,125
剩余的原材料
The rest of the raw materials,

856
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:36,126
巴顿探员都能轻松得到
Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.

857
00:54:36,342 --> 00:54:37,716
现在他只需要一个部件
The only major component he still needs

858
00:54:37,927 --> 00:54:41,425
高能量密度的动力源
is a power source of high-energy density.

859
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:44,888
来启动立方
Something to kick-start the Cube.

860
00:54:45,101 --> 00:54:48,054
你什么时候变成热核天体物理学家了？
When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?

861
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:49,265
昨天晚上
Last night.

862
00:54:49,772 --> 00:54:52,974
看看任务资料，绍韦的笔记和精选的理论论文
The packet, Selvig's notes, the extraction theory papers.

863
00:54:53,192 --> 00:54:54,187
难道只有我看了？
Am I the only one who did the reading?

864
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,146
洛基需要某种特定的能源吗？
Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?

865
00:54:57,363 --> 00:55:00,067
他得把立方加热到1.2亿开氏度
He would have to heat the Cube to 120-million Kelvin

866
00:55:00,282 --> 00:55:01,740
以突破库仑势垒
just to break through the Coulomb barrier.

867
00:55:01,951 --> 00:55:04,156
除非绍韦找到
Unless Selvig has figured out how to stabilise

868
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:05,483
稳定量子隧道效应的办法
the quantum tunneling effect.

869
00:55:05,704 --> 00:55:06,699
如果他真找到了
Well, if he could do that,

870
00:55:06,872 --> 00:55:09,327
就可以用地球上任一个反应堆完成重离子聚变
he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet.

871
00:55:09,542 --> 00:55:11,948
终于有会说人话的了
Finally, someone who speaks English.

872
00:55:12,169 --> 00:55:14,125
是那么回事吗？
Is that what just happened?

873
00:55:14,338 --> 00:55:16,330
很高兴见到你，班纳博士
It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.

874
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:19,584
你在反电子冲撞领域中的成就无人能及
Your work on antielectron collisions is unparalleled.

875
00:55:19,802 --> 00:55:21,592
我也是你失控时变成的
And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control

876
00:55:21,804 --> 00:55:23,842
那个绿色大怪兽的铁杆粉丝
and turn into an enormous green rage-monster.

877
00:55:25,391 --> 00:55:26,421
谢谢
Thanks.

878
00:55:26,642 --> 00:55:29,132
班纳博士只为追寻立方而来
Dr. Banner is only here to track the Cube.

879
00:55:29,353 --> 00:55:30,633
我希望你可以助他一臂之力
I was hoping you might join him.

880
00:55:30,855 --> 00:55:32,016
从他的权杖开始看吧
I would start with that stick of his.

881
00:55:32,148 --> 00:55:33,178
它也许有魔力
It may be magical,

882
00:55:33,315 --> 00:55:34,595
但用法和海德拉的武器挺像的
but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.

883
00:55:34,734 --> 00:55:37,769
我不大清楚，但它由立方所驱动
I don't know about that, but it is powered by the Cube.

884
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:39,813
我想知道洛基怎么用它
And I would like to know how Loki used it

885
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:41,607
把我见过的最机警的两个人
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

886
00:55:41,741 --> 00:55:43,531
变成他的跟班飞猴
into his personal flying monkeys.

887
00:55:43,909 --> 00:55:45,451
猴子？你在说什么
Monkeys? I do not understand.

888
00:55:45,578 --> 00:55:46,572
绿野仙踪，我知道
I do.

889
00:55:49,582 --> 00:55:51,454
我知道这典故
I understood that reference.

890
00:55:52,376 --> 00:55:53,704
我们开始吧，博士？
Shall we play, Doctor?

891
00:55:53,919 --> 00:55:55,626
这边请，先生
This way, sir.

892
00:56:09,602 --> 00:56:11,178
伽玛读数和绍韦报告上
The gamma readings are definitely consistent

893
00:56:11,395 --> 00:56:13,387
宇宙立方的读数完全一致
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

894
00:56:13,773 --> 00:56:15,396
但处理起来要花好几周时间
But it's going to take weeks to process.

895
00:56:15,608 --> 00:56:16,805
如果可以绕过他们的主机
If we bypass their mainframe

896
00:56:16,942 --> 00:56:18,222
连接到主群集
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

897
00:56:18,444 --> 00:56:21,527
我们可以做到每秒600兆次浮点运算
we can clock this at around 600 teraflops.

898
00:56:22,698 --> 00:56:24,654
可惜我只带了牙刷
All I packed was a toothbrush.

899
00:56:25,743 --> 00:56:27,319
有空来史塔大厦玩玩
You know, you should come by Stark Tower sometime.

900
00:56:27,536 --> 00:56:29,575
顶10层用作科研
Top ten floors, all R&D.

901
00:56:29,914 --> 00:56:31,371
包你喜欢
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

902
00:56:31,582 --> 00:56:34,072
谢了，上次我在纽约
Thanks, but the last time I was in New York,

903
00:56:34,293 --> 00:56:36,830
差点炸了哈莱姆区
I kind of broke Harlem.

904
00:56:37,046 --> 00:56:38,872
我保证这次你会毫无压力
Well, I promise a stress-free environment.

905
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:40,880
毫不紧张，绝无意外
No tension, no surprises.

906
00:56:40,899 --> 00:56:42,233
- Ow!

907
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:43,735
Hey! - Nothing?

908
00:56:44,095 --> 00:56:45,089
你疯了？
Are you nuts?

909
00:56:45,221 --> 00:56:46,215
天晓得
Jury's out.

910
00:56:46,347 --> 00:56:47,460
自制力不错啊
You really have got a lid on it, haven't you?

911
00:56:47,598 --> 00:56:48,593
有何秘诀？
What's your secret?

912
00:56:48,724 --> 00:56:50,182
玩爵士乐还是磕药？
Mellow jazz, bongo drums huge bag of weed?

913
00:56:50,351 --> 00:56:51,464
你很爱开玩笑吗？
Is everything a joke to you?

914
00:56:51,769 --> 00:56:52,764
好玩嘛
Funny things are.

915
00:56:52,895 --> 00:56:54,637
这会令大家身陷险境
Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship

916
00:56:54,772 --> 00:56:56,016
何来好玩
isn't funny.

917
00:56:56,148 --> 00:56:57,143
对不起，博士
No offence, Doc.

918
00:56:57,274 --> 00:56:58,768
没关系，若我连这小刺激都适应不了
It's all right, I wouldn't have come aboard

919
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:01,735
就不会登船了
if I couldn't handle pointy things.

920
00:57:01,862 --> 00:57:04,435
大块头，你太谨慎了，放松点
You're tip-toeing, big man. You need to strut.

921
00:57:04,573 --> 00:57:06,232
而你需要专注解决问题，史塔先生
And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark.

922
00:57:06,367 --> 00:57:07,860
难道我没有做事吗？
Do you think I'm not?

923
00:57:07,993 --> 00:57:10,780
为何霍利现在才召集我们？
Why did Fury call us in? Why now? Why not before?

924
00:57:10,913 --> 00:57:12,655
有何内幕？
What isn't he telling us?

925
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:14,532
消除所有疑惑，我才能做事
I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.

926
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:16,411
你指霍利有所隐瞒？
You think Fury's hiding something?

927
00:57:16,544 --> 00:57:19,709
毕竟他可是特务中的佼佼者
He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.

928
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:21,580
深不可测
His secrets have secrets.

929
00:57:21,714 --> 00:57:23,208
他也有同感吧？
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

930
00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:24,234
Uh...

931
00:57:25,802 --> 00:57:27,592
我只想完成我在这里的工作
I just want to finish my work here, and...

932
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:28,715
博士?
Doctor?

933
00:57:34,144 --> 00:57:36,515
点起照亮人类前程的明灯
"A warm light for all mankind."

934
00:57:36,646 --> 00:57:38,721
提及宇宙立方时，洛基这样对霍利说道
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

935
00:57:38,857 --> 00:57:40,314
我听见了
I heard it.

936
00:57:40,442 --> 00:57:42,729
是说给你听的
I think that was meant for you.

937
00:57:43,445 --> 00:57:46,398
即使巴顿没跟洛基提过史塔大厦
Even if Barton didn't tell Loki about the tower,

938
00:57:46,531 --> 00:57:47,609
他也可以由新闻得知
it was still all over the news.

939
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:49,816
史塔大厦？高耸又奇丑…
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly

940
00:57:51,161 --> 00:57:52,405
的纽约建筑大厦？
building in New York?

941
00:57:52,537 --> 00:57:56,237
由弦反应炉供能，能源可自生
It's powered by an arc reactor, a self-sustaining energy source.

942
00:57:56,374 --> 00:57:58,781
大厦能自给自足一年吗？
That building will run itself for, what, a year?

943
00:57:58,918 --> 00:58:00,744
只是个试点
It's just the prototype.

944
00:58:00,879 --> 00:58:02,835
我可是目前洁净能源的先驱者
I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.

945
00:58:03,256 --> 00:58:04,666
这就是他的目的
That's what he's getting at.

946
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:07,372
为何神盾局没招揽他加入宇宙立方计划？
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. bring him in on the Tesseract project?

947
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:10,715
当初为何他们会涉足能源产业？
What are they doing in the energy business in the first place?

948
00:58:10,847 --> 00:58:13,800
一旦我获悉所有神盾局的机密
I should probably look into that once my decryption program

949
00:58:13,933 --> 00:58:16,091
我会着手调查此事
finishes breaking into all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

950
00:58:16,227 --> 00:58:17,222
对不起，你说…
I'm sorry. Did you say...

951
00:58:17,353 --> 00:58:19,345
自我上船来，佐维斯就一直运行破解程式
Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.

952
00:58:19,481 --> 00:58:21,057
几小时后，我就可以得知
In a few hours, I'll know every dirty secret

953
00:58:21,191 --> 00:58:22,352
神盾局的隐藏机密
S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide.

954
00:58:22,484 --> 00:58:23,478
吃蓝莓吗?
Blueberry?

955
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:25,482
你仍为没被招揽而百思不解？
Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around.

956
00:58:25,612 --> 00:58:28,446
情报机构竟然害怕聪明人？
An intelligence organisation that fears intelligence?

957
00:58:28,573 --> 00:58:30,150
真没劲
Historically, not awesome.

958
00:58:30,283 --> 00:58:32,571
洛基想挑拨离间
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

959
00:58:32,702 --> 00:58:34,279
洛基肯定意图发动战争
This is a man who means to start a war

960
00:58:34,412 --> 00:58:35,953
继续这样下去，岂不正中他下怀
and if we don't stay focused, he'll succeed.

961
00:58:37,248 --> 00:58:39,703
既然有命在身，就要服从
We have orders. We should follow them.

962
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:42,201
我可不喜欢臣服于他人
Following's not really my style.

963
00:58:43,421 --> 00:58:45,792
你想出风头吧？
And you're all about style, aren't you?

964
00:58:45,924 --> 00:58:46,954
在座各位
Of the people in this room,

965
00:58:47,092 --> 00:58:48,668
当中有人着装奇异
which one is, A, wearing a spangly outfit,

966
00:58:48,802 --> 00:58:50,129
简直不成气候
and, B, not of use?

967
00:58:50,261 --> 00:58:54,590
斯蒂夫，你不觉得不自在吗？
Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you.

968
00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:58,340
找立方吧
Just find the Cube.

969
00:59:00,747 --> 00:59:02,624


970
00:59:11,282 --> 00:59:13,191
他就是让我父亲赞不绝口的家伙？
That's the guy my dad never shut up about?

971
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,446
他们应该再次冷藏他
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.

972
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:17,096
Huh.

973
00:59:17,288 --> 00:59:18,995
他很了解洛基
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

974
00:59:19,124 --> 00:59:20,866
他看事情比我们敏锐
He does have the jump on us.

975
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,704
他就像导火索
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

976
00:59:23,837 --> 00:59:25,662
迟早会搞砸一切
It's going to blow up in his face.

977
00:59:25,797 --> 00:59:28,085
到时我拭目以待
And I'm going to be there when it does.

978
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,540
我就会由新闻得知过程
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

979
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:33,958
不如你也着装加入我们
Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up with the rest of us.

980
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:34,948


981
00:59:35,557 --> 00:59:39,138
你看，可我没有护甲
You see, I don't get a suit of armour.

982
00:59:39,269 --> 00:59:42,601
赤手空拳打战简直寻死
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

983
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:44,473
太糟糕了
It's a nightmare.

984
00:59:44,607 --> 00:59:47,394
每时每刻都有一堆炮弹碎片
I've got a cluster of shrapnel trying every second

985
00:59:47,527 --> 00:59:49,519
试图侵入我心脏
to crawl its way into my heart.

986
00:59:49,654 --> 00:59:51,693
这个保护了我
This stops it.

987
00:59:51,823 --> 00:59:54,147
这个小光环是我身体一部分了
This little circle of light, it's part of me now,

988
00:59:55,368 --> 00:59:57,027
不止是护甲
not just armour.

989
00:59:57,704 --> 01:00:00,158
是可怕的天赐
It's a terrible privilege.

990
01:00:00,497 --> 01:00:02,868
- 不过你可以控制它 - 我只是学会使用
- But you can control it. - Because I learned how.

991
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:03,995
不能这样说
It's different.

992
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:07,667
我听闻过你的事情
Hey, I read all about your accident.

993
01:00:07,796 --> 01:00:11,129
如此强的伽马射线早该杀死你
That much gamma exposure should have killed you.

994
01:00:11,258 --> 01:00:13,713
你意指绿巨人浩克
So you're saying that the Hulk...

995
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:17,550
他救了我？
The other guy saved my life?

996
01:00:18,056 --> 01:00:19,170
说得好
That's nice.

997
01:00:20,058 --> 01:00:23,841
观点不错，可为什么救我？
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

998
01:00:25,147 --> 01:00:27,055
我们会知道的
I guess we'll find out.

999
01:00:28,776 --> 01:00:30,435
届时你就会闷闷不乐
You may not enjoy that.

1000
01:00:30,569 --> 01:00:32,525
说不定你会高兴起来
And you just might.

1001
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:36,709
（机密仓库10-C）

1002
01:00:37,218 --> 01:00:39,262


1003
01:00:39,345 --> 01:00:40,805


1004
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:55,570


1005
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:33,130
洛基一带走博士
As soon as Loki took the doctor,

1006
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:34,999
我们就把珍儿转移了
we moved Jane Foster.

1007
01:01:35,134 --> 01:01:37,505
挪威有个一流的天文台
They've got an excellent observatory in Tromsø.

1008
01:01:37,636 --> 01:01:41,170
珍儿昨天应邀过去做顾问
She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday.

1009
01:01:41,306 --> 01:01:45,089
酬劳不菲，有私人飞机，离这里很远
Handsome fee, private plane, very remote.

1010
01:01:45,978 --> 01:01:47,008
她会很安全
She'll be safe.

1011
01:01:47,146 --> 01:01:48,520
多谢
Thank you.

1012
01:01:50,315 --> 01:01:52,354
洛基带走艾力博士，并非巧合
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.

1013
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,933
不知道事后洛基会如何处置博士
I dread what he plans for him once he's done.

1014
01:01:56,071 --> 01:01:57,185
艾力是个好人
Erik is a good man.

1015
01:01:57,322 --> 01:01:58,317
他经常提及你
He talks about you a lot.

1016
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,192
你改变了他一生
You changed his life.

1017
01:02:03,912 --> 01:02:05,785
你也改变了这里一切
You changed everything around here.

1018
01:02:05,914 --> 01:02:08,036
还是原来的好
They were better as they were.

1019
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:10,700
在永恒国度，我们自命不凡
We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced

1020
01:02:10,836 --> 01:02:14,536
来到凡间却如巨兽
but we come here, battling like bilge snipe.

1021
01:02:14,673 --> 01:02:16,499
- 什么？ - 巨兽
- Like what? - Bilge snipe.

1022
01:02:16,633 --> 01:02:19,669
巨型，有鳞，有鹿角
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

1023
01:02:20,471 --> 01:02:22,261
- 这里没有吧？ - 应该没有
- You don't have those? - I don't think so.

1024
01:02:22,389 --> 01:02:24,262
它们很讨厌
Well, they are repulsive.

1025
01:02:25,601 --> 01:02:27,842
它们践踏所经之处
And they trample everything in their path.

1026
01:02:35,527 --> 01:02:38,860
我首次来地球时，亦使洛基迁怒于此
When I first came to Earth, Loki's rage followed me here,

1027
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:41,313
人类损失惨重
and your people paid the price.

1028
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:43,240
如今历史再现
And now, again.

1029
01:02:45,787 --> 01:02:48,241
年壮时我热衷战斗
In my youth, I courted war.

1030
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:51,991
战争还没有开始
War hasn't started yet.

1031
01:02:53,127 --> 01:02:54,918
你认为你可以令洛基告诉我们
You think you could make Loki tell us

1032
01:02:55,046 --> 01:02:56,325
立方在哪吗？
where the Tesseract is?

1033
01:02:56,464 --> 01:02:59,713
洛基深不可测
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

1034
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:04,550
他不但要权力，还要报复我
It's not just power he craves, it's vengeance, upon me.

1035
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,802
为求达到目的，他会不择手段
There's no pain would prise his need from him.

1036
01:03:07,892 --> 01:03:11,721
简直不知天高地厚
A lot of guys think that until the pain starts.

1037
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:15,516
你有何吩咐
What are you asking me to do?

1038
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:19,232
那你有何计划？
I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?

1039
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:20,392
洛基已是阶下囚
Loki is a prisoner.

1040
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:24,567
为何我觉得他才是唯一想留在船上的人？
Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here?

1041
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:40,255
可以潜近我身边的人不多
There's not many people who can sneak up on me.

1042
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:42,042
你猜到是我了
But you figured I'd come.

1043
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:44,295
不过
After.

1044
01:03:45,179 --> 01:03:48,594
应该是在局长折磨我后
After whatever tortures Fury can concoct,

1045
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:52,389
你会如知己般出现，安慰我
you would appear as a friend, as a balm.

1046
01:03:53,354 --> 01:03:55,013
接着我就会同你合作
And I would cooperate.

1047
01:03:55,148 --> 01:03:57,139
你对巴顿特工做过什么？
I want to know what you've done to Agent Barton.

1048
01:03:57,275 --> 01:03:59,266
我只是打开他心境
I would say I've expanded his mind.

1049
01:04:01,863 --> 01:04:03,771
那你赢得一切后
And once you've won,

1050
01:04:04,657 --> 01:04:05,937
成为众神之王以后
once you're king of the mountain,

1051
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:10,567
会如何处置他？
what happens to his mind?

1052
01:04:10,473 --> 01:04:11,474


1053
01:04:11,831 --> 01:04:13,621
爱之心切吗？
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

1054
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,584
爱是孩童玩意，我只是欠他人情
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

1055
01:04:20,465 --> 01:04:22,337
告诉我
Tell me.

1056
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:29,928
效力神盾局前
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D... I, uh...

1057
01:04:32,351 --> 01:04:36,265
我已稍有名气
Well, I made a name for myself.

1058
01:04:36,397 --> 01:04:39,397
因为天赋异禀
I have a very specific skill set.

1059
01:04:39,525 --> 01:04:43,189
所以肆无忌惮
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

1060
01:04:44,197 --> 01:04:47,695
因此上了神盾局的黑名单
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar in a bad way.

1061
01:04:48,868 --> 01:04:51,784
巴顿特工奉命刺杀我
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

1062
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:54,371
但他没杀我
He made a different call.

1063
01:04:56,334 --> 01:04:59,369
若我答应放过他，你会如何报答？
And what will you do if I vow to spare him?

1064
01:04:59,754 --> 01:05:01,081
我不会放你出来的
Not let you out.

1065
01:05:01,214 --> 01:05:03,086
相当有趣
No, but I like this.

1066
01:05:04,008 --> 01:05:07,423
自身难保，你竟敢讨价还价
Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man.

1067
01:05:07,553 --> 01:05:09,628
改朝换代是常有的事
Regimes fall every day.

1068
01:05:09,764 --> 01:05:12,301
我都不在乎，我是俄国人
I tend not to weep over that. I'm Russian.

1069
01:05:12,433 --> 01:05:13,428
曾是
Or I was.

1070
01:05:14,727 --> 01:05:16,386
现在呢？
And what are you now?

1071
01:05:16,854 --> 01:05:19,807
很简单
It's really not that complicated.

1072
01:05:19,941 --> 01:05:24,020
我要还清血债
I got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.

1073
01:05:25,028 --> 01:05:26,569
行吗？
Can you?

1074
01:05:27,906 --> 01:05:31,689
能还清吗？
Can you wipe out that much red?

1075
01:05:32,869 --> 01:05:34,660
得雷科夫的女儿
Dreykov's daughter,

1076
01:05:36,081 --> 01:05:37,907
圣保罗…
São Paulo,

1077
01:05:38,959 --> 01:05:41,449
医院失火事件？
the hospital fire?

1078
01:05:42,295 --> 01:05:44,667
巴顿已对我和盘托出
Barton told me everything.

1079
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:47,881
你背负不少血债
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red

1080
01:05:48,009 --> 01:05:50,499
单凭拯救个不比你好多少的人
and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself

1081
01:05:50,637 --> 01:05:52,011
就可以令自己良心好过？
will change anything?

1082
01:05:52,139 --> 01:05:54,807
未免太过自以为是
This is the basest sentimentality.

1083
01:05:54,933 --> 01:05:57,174
简直幼稚
This is a child at prayer.

1084
01:05:57,310 --> 01:05:58,590
太可怜
Pathetic!

1085
01:05:59,396 --> 01:06:01,968
你满口胡言，杀戮无数
You lie and kill

1086
01:06:02,107 --> 01:06:05,142
助纣为虐
in the service of liars and killers.

1087
01:06:05,488 --> 01:06:07,427
（发现病毒 非法入侵）

1088
01:06:08,238 --> 01:06:14,237
你以为可以置身事外
You pretend to be separate,to have your own code,something that makes up for the horrors.

1089
01:06:15,412 --> 01:06:17,818
但江山易改
But they are part of you.

1090
01:06:17,956 --> 01:06:21,739
本性难移
And they will never go away.

1091
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:25,834
巴顿没杀死你之前，我不会杀他
I won't touch Barton, not until I make him kill you.

1092
01:06:25,964 --> 01:06:28,205
我要他用尽你所恐惧的方式
Slowly, intimately,

1093
01:06:28,341 --> 01:06:30,713
驾轻就熟地杀死你
in every way he knows you fear.

1094
01:06:30,844 --> 01:06:33,927
当他苏醒时，见到自己的所为
And then he'll wake just long enough to see his good work

1095
01:06:34,055 --> 01:06:37,506
就会尖叫，而我会趁机取他首级
and when he screams, I'll split his skull.

1096
01:06:37,642 --> 01:06:40,761
这就是我的目的，哭吧，贱人
This is my bargain, you mewling quim.

1097
01:06:40,581 --> 01:06:41,999


1098
01:06:42,355 --> 01:06:43,932
怪物
You're a monster.

1099
01:06:44,794 --> 01:06:46,003


1100
01:06:46,087 --> 01:06:47,588
噢，不
Oh, no.

1101
01:06:48,528 --> 01:06:50,105
你带来的那个才是怪物
You brought the monster.

1102
01:06:53,116 --> 01:06:54,693
利用班纳
So, Banner.

1103
01:06:55,744 --> 01:06:56,905
这就是你的计划
That's your play.

1104
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:57,951
什么？
What?

1105
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:00,698
洛基计划利用班纳
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

1106
01:07:00,832 --> 01:07:02,290
令班纳留在实验室，我马上过来
Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.

1107
01:07:02,417 --> 01:07:03,495
顺道也让托尔过来
Send Thor as well.

1108
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:06,497
多谢
Thank you

1109
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:08,787
你的合作
for your cooperation.

1110
01:07:16,306 --> 01:07:17,764
干嘛，史塔先生
What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

1111
01:07:17,891 --> 01:07:20,381
我同你有一样的疑惑
Uh, kind of been wondering the same thing about you.

1112
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:22,391
你本该追踪立方的位置
You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.

1113
01:07:22,521 --> 01:07:24,097
没错，已经锁定位置
We are. The model's locked

1114
01:07:24,231 --> 01:07:25,510
正在匹配标记
and we're sweeping for the signature now.

1115
01:07:25,649 --> 01:07:26,644
顺利的话
When we get a hit,

1116
01:07:26,775 --> 01:07:28,731
就可以锁定目标于半公里范围内
we'll have the location within half a mile.

1117
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:31,362
接着就可以拿回立方，别着急
Yeah, then you get your Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1118
01:07:31,363 --> 01:07:33,105


1119
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,353
何为「第二阶段」？
What is "Phase 2"?

1120
01:07:36,576 --> 01:07:39,410
第二阶段是神盾局会利用立方制作武器
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses the Cube to make weapons.

1121
01:07:39,538 --> 01:07:41,280
对不起，电脑不如我反应快
Sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me.

1122
01:07:41,415 --> 01:07:44,118
罗杰斯，我们收集了所有有关立方的信息
Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract.

1123
01:07:44,251 --> 01:07:45,708
这不代表我们要制作…
This does not mean that we're making...

1124
01:07:45,836 --> 01:07:46,830
得了
I'm sorry, Nick.

1125
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:49,249
你还想狡辩
What were you lying?

1126
01:07:49,381 --> 01:07:50,625
原来如此
I was wrong, Director.

1127
01:07:50,757 --> 01:07:51,787
世界还是没有改变
The world hasn't changed a bit.

1128
01:07:51,925 --> 01:07:52,955
你知情？
Did you know about this?

1129
01:07:53,093 --> 01:07:55,880
博士，你想离开这里吗？
You want to think about removing yourself from this environment, Doctor?

1130
01:07:56,012 --> 01:07:58,170
我在加尔各答时，也很想离开
I was in Calcutta. I was pretty well removed.

1131
01:07:58,306 --> 01:07:59,468
洛基在利用你
Loki is manipulating you.

1132
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,176
那你呢？
And you've been doing what, exactly?

1133
01:08:01,309 --> 01:08:02,968
你不是因我对你抛媚眼而来这里
You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.

1134
01:08:03,103 --> 01:08:05,634
那我也不会因为你觉得不安而离开
Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy.

1135
01:08:05,772 --> 01:08:07,396
我想知道为什么
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1136
01:08:07,523 --> 01:08:11,223
神盾局要利用立方来制作大杀伤力武器
is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.

1137
01:08:11,861 --> 01:08:12,974
因为他
Because of him.

1138
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,275
我？
Me?

1139
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,611
去年，有异星客来访地球
Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet

1140
01:08:18,743 --> 01:08:21,908
异星客间的斗争摧毁了一个小镇
who had a grudge match that leveled a small town.

1141
01:08:22,037 --> 01:08:24,243
我们才知道原来天外有生命
We learned that not only are we not alone

1142
01:08:24,373 --> 01:08:27,955
而且相较之下，人类简直不堪一击
but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.

1143
01:08:28,085 --> 01:08:30,326
我的臣民只想和你们和平共处
My people want nothing but peace with your planet.

1144
01:08:30,463 --> 01:08:32,419
你不是唯一的天外生命体
But you're not the only people out there, are you?

1145
01:08:32,548 --> 01:08:34,504
难保没有其他生命体威胁地球
And you're not the only threat.

1146
01:08:34,633 --> 01:08:37,799
正所谓一山还有一山高
The world's filling up with people who can't be matched,

1147
01:08:38,471 --> 01:08:39,668
世事难以控制
that can't be controlled.

1148
01:08:39,805 --> 01:08:40,919
所以要控制立方？
Like you controlled the Cube?

1149
01:08:41,056 --> 01:08:42,300
正因为你开发立方
Your work with the Tesseract

1150
01:08:42,433 --> 01:08:45,005
才招致洛基等人到来
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

1151
01:08:45,144 --> 01:08:46,518
你已经向九大领域传达一个信息
It is a signal to all the realms

1152
01:08:46,645 --> 01:08:49,314
宣布地球已经准备好高规格战斗
that the Earth is ready for a higher form of war.

1153
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:50,518
高规格战斗
A higher form?

1154
01:08:50,649 --> 01:08:51,644
你逼人在先
You forced our hand.

1155
01:08:51,776 --> 01:08:52,770
我们总要有对策
We had to come up with something.

1156
01:08:52,902 --> 01:08:53,896
用核武器镇压
A nuclear deterrent.

1157
01:08:54,028 --> 01:08:56,019
这总能避免大动干戈
Because that always calms everything right down.

1158
01:08:56,155 --> 01:08:58,526
我倒忘了你可是发战争财起家的
Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark.

1159
01:08:58,657 --> 01:09:01,029
若他仍制作武器，他就会…
I'm sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck-deep...

1160
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,783
干嘛矛头对向我了？
Hold on. How is this now about me?

1161
01:09:02,912 --> 01:09:04,025
你不是喜欢一切对向你吗？
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1162
01:09:04,163 --> 01:09:06,036
还以为人类已经高度文明了
I thought humans were more evolved than this.

1163
01:09:06,165 --> 01:09:09,035
再怎么也不会跑到尊星球打仗啦
Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?

1164
01:09:09,168 --> 01:09:11,041
你们如此不信任你的战友
You treat your champions with such mistrust.

1165
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:12,628
你们好天真啊
Are you boys really that naïve?

1166
01:09:12,755 --> 01:09:14,628
神盾局监视潜在危险
S.H.I.E.L.D. monitors potential threats.

1167
01:09:14,757 --> 01:09:16,036
美国队长也是潜在威胁?
Captain America's on threat watch?

1168
01:09:16,175 --> 01:09:17,170
我们都是
We all are.

1169
01:09:17,301 --> 01:09:18,711
你也在监视列表上？
Wait, you're on that list?

1170
01:09:18,844 --> 01:09:20,385
你在强忍怒气吗？
Are you above or below angry bees?

1171
01:09:20,513 --> 01:09:22,635
史塔，你试试再耍嘴皮…
Stark, so help me God, if you make one more wisecrack...

1172
01:09:22,765 --> 01:09:24,009
威胁我！我好怕啊
Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.

1173
01:09:24,141 --> 01:09:26,631
- 放尊重点 - 尊重什么？
- Show some respect. - Respect what?

1174
01:09:26,664 --> 01:09:28,749


1175
01:09:33,984 --> 01:09:36,901
运输机66B，请回复确认代码
Transport Six-Six-Bravo, please relay confirm codes.

1176
01:09:37,029 --> 01:09:39,187
电脑中找到你的资料，但不是在航行日志中
I've got you on the computer, but not on the day log.

1177
01:09:39,323 --> 01:09:41,398
请告知货物
What is your haul? Over.

1178
01:09:41,534 --> 01:09:44,154
武器和弹药
Arms and ammunition. Over.

1179
01:09:52,503 --> 01:09:54,708
说到秩序，这里不也一团糟
You speak of control, yet you court chaos.

1180
01:09:54,839 --> 01:09:56,546
这就是他的管理手法
That's his M.O., isn't it?

1181
01:09:56,674 --> 01:09:57,918
我们还是一个团队吗？
I mean, what are we, a team?

1182
01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:01,003
我们只是制造混乱的化学怪物
No, we're a chemical mixture that makes chaos.

1183
01:10:01,137 --> 01:10:03,093
我们是定时炸弹
We're a time bomb.

1184
01:10:03,222 --> 01:10:05,048
你冷静下
You need to step away.

1185
01:10:05,182 --> 01:10:07,008
为何不让人发泄下？
Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?

1186
01:10:07,143 --> 01:10:09,265
明知故问，走开
You know damn well why. Back off!

1187
01:10:09,395 --> 01:10:11,600
你有本事让我走开吗
I'm starting to want you to make me.

1188
01:10:11,731 --> 01:10:15,348
躲在盔甲内装英雄
Yeah. Big man in a suit of armour.

1189
01:10:15,484 --> 01:10:16,942
没有盔甲，你还能是什么？
Take that off, what are you?

1190
01:10:17,069 --> 01:10:19,393
是天才，富翁，花花公子，慈善家
Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.

1191
01:10:20,281 --> 01:10:23,446
很多没有那些头衔的人，都比你厉害
I know guys with none of that worth ten of you.

1192
01:10:23,576 --> 01:10:24,570
我看过你的镜头
I've seen the footage.

1193
01:10:24,702 --> 01:10:26,943
你只会为自己而战
The only thing you really fight for is yourself.

1194
01:10:28,414 --> 01:10:30,322
你不会顾全大局
You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play,

1195
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:32,948
你不会躺在铁丝网，让别人走过
to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.

1196
01:10:33,085 --> 01:10:35,207
我会剪掉铁丝
I think I would just cut the wire.

1197
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,045
就会耍急智
Always a way out.

1198
01:10:40,176 --> 01:10:41,420
你或许构不成威胁
You may not be a threat

1199
01:10:41,552 --> 01:10:43,460
但你别再假装是英雄
but you better stop pretending to be a hero.

1200
01:10:43,596 --> 01:10:46,050
像你这样的英雄？
A hero? Like you?

1201
01:10:46,182 --> 01:10:48,220
你只是个实验品
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.

1202
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:51,968
你的超能力只是来自一瓶血清
Everything special about you came out of a bottle.

1203
01:11:14,021 --> 01:11:15,022


1204
01:11:17,253 --> 01:11:20,087
穿上盔甲，咱们打下
Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.

1205
01:11:19,902 --> 01:11:20,945


1206
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:24,541
你们好小气
You people are so petty and tiny.

1207
01:11:24,677 --> 01:11:25,672
这就是一个团队
Yeah, this is a team.

1208
01:11:25,804 --> 01:11:27,048
罗曼诺夫特工，请你护送
Agent Romanoff, would you escort

1209
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:28,294
班纳博士回去…
Dr. Banner back to his...

1210
01:11:28,431 --> 01:11:30,090
回哪去？你已经把我的房间占了
Where? You rented my room.

1211
01:11:30,225 --> 01:11:31,682
那只是以防…
The cell was just in case...

1212
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:33,351
以防你想杀了我
In case you needed to kill me.

1213
01:11:33,478 --> 01:11:36,394
不过那是不可能的，我曾试过
But you can't. I know, I tried.

1214
01:11:39,109 --> 01:11:42,025
最低潮时期，我万念俱灰
I got low. I didn't see an end.

1215
01:11:42,153 --> 01:11:46,613
我饮弹自尽，可绿巨人却吐出来
So, I put a bullet in my mouth, and the other guy spit it out.

1216
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,397
所以我死不成
So I moved on.

1217
01:11:48,535 --> 01:11:51,369
之后我致力帮助他人，本来相安无事
I focused on helping other people. I was good.

1218
01:11:51,496 --> 01:11:53,701
直到你拉我回到这个怪物聚会
Until you dragged me back into this freak show

1219
01:11:53,832 --> 01:11:55,206
把所有人置于危险之中
and put everyone here at risk.

1220
01:11:55,333 --> 01:11:57,408
想知道我的秘诀吗，罗曼诺夫探员？
You want to know my secret, Agent Romanoff?

1221
01:11:57,544 --> 01:11:59,369
想知道我怎么保持冷静？
You want to know how I stay calm?

1222
01:12:02,173 --> 01:12:04,331
班纳博士
Dr. Banner,

1223
01:12:05,135 --> 01:12:06,462
放下权杖
put down the sceptre.

1224
01:12:11,896 --> 01:12:12,565
（伽马射线 吻合度百分之九十五）

1225
01:12:12,705 --> 01:12:14,081


1226
01:12:15,228 --> 01:12:16,390
找到了
Got it.

1227
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:18,225
对不起，孩子们
Sorry, kids,

1228
01:12:18,356 --> 01:12:20,099
你们见识不到我的拿手好戏了
you don't get to see my party trick after all.

1229
01:12:20,233 --> 01:12:21,228
找到立方？
You located the Tesseract?

1230
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:22,354
我可以很快到达
I could get there fastest.

1231
01:12:22,485 --> 01:12:24,607
立方属于亚斯加特，人类无法驾驭它
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard. No human is a match for it.

1232
01:12:24,738 --> 01:12:26,065
- 你不能独自去 - 你要阻止我？
- You're not going alone. - You're gonna stop me?

1233
01:12:26,197 --> 01:12:27,192
穿上盔甲，比试下
Put on the suit, let's find out.

1234
01:12:27,323 --> 01:12:28,603
我才不怕和老年人打架
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

1235
01:12:28,742 --> 01:12:29,736
穿上盔甲
Put on the suit.

1236
01:12:29,596 --> 01:12:30,681


1237
01:12:31,656 --> 01:12:32,085
（伽马射线定位）

1238
01:12:32,558 --> 01:12:33,934
噢，我的天啊
Oh, my God.

1239
01:12:42,735 --> 01:12:43,736


1240
01:12:49,763 --> 01:12:50,757
穿上盔甲
Put on the suit.

1241
01:12:50,784 --> 01:12:52,119
耶
Yeah.

1242
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:54,121


1243
01:12:54,934 --> 01:12:56,677
各就各位
All hands to stations.

1244
01:12:58,292 --> 01:12:59,793


1245
01:13:00,815 --> 01:13:02,606
机身外部受袭
External detonation.

1246
01:13:02,734 --> 01:13:03,978
三号引擎停止运作
Number three engine is down.

1247
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:05,105
我们受袭
We've been hit.

1248
01:13:05,236 --> 01:13:06,398
- 能否重运作？ - 三号引擎着火
- Can they get it running? - Fire in engine three!

1249
01:13:06,529 --> 01:13:07,524
具体如何
Talk to me.

1250
01:13:07,655 --> 01:13:09,279
涡轮似乎完好
Turbine looks mostly intact

1251
01:13:09,407 --> 01:13:12,819
但在空中无法修复机件
but it's impossible to get out there to make repairs while we're in the air.

1252
01:13:12,952 --> 01:13:15,489
再多个引擎坏掉，就会坠机
If we lose one more engine, we won't be.

1253
01:13:15,622 --> 01:13:17,613
要派人出去修复引擎
Somebody's got to get outside and patch that engine.

1254
01:13:17,749 --> 01:13:19,456
- 史塔，收到吗？ - 我马上去
- Stark, you copy that? - I'm on it.

1255
01:13:19,584 --> 01:13:22,869
古逊，关押区实施防御封锁

1257
01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:25,244
罗曼诺夫？
Romanoff?

1258
01:13:26,945 --> 01:13:28,739


1259
01:13:28,885 --> 01:13:30,343
我们没事
We're okay.

1260
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:32,117


1261
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:34,174
会没事的
We're okay, right?

1262
01:13:46,777 --> 01:13:47,974
- 不要让他们修复引擎 - 遵命
- Keep that engine down! - Yes, sir.

1263
01:13:48,112 --> 01:13:49,819
去关押区，等待监视器关闭
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.

1264
01:13:49,947 --> 01:13:51,737
- 收到 - 跟紧
- Got it. - Stay close.

1265
01:13:53,492 --> 01:13:54,985
走，到第四层
Let's go, Level 4.

1266
01:13:55,953 --> 01:13:58,739
三号引擎，在那里碰头
Engine three. I'll meet you there.

1267
01:14:03,649 --> 01:14:04,817


1268
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:06,777


1269
01:14:06,922 --> 01:14:08,084
博士？
Doctor?

1270
01:14:07,903 --> 01:14:08,904


1271
01:14:10,467 --> 01:14:11,462
布斯？
Bruce?

1272
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,424
冷静，否则正中洛基下怀
You got to fight it. This is just what Loki wants.

1273
01:14:16,807 --> 01:14:17,837
听着，会没事的
We're going to be okay. Listen to me.

1274
01:14:17,975 --> 01:14:18,970
你受伤了吗
Are you hurt?

1275
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:24,476
会没事的
We're going to be okay. All right?

1276
01:14:24,606 --> 01:14:27,357
我以性命担保，我会救你出去
I swear on my life, I will get you out of this.

1277
01:14:27,484 --> 01:14:28,859
你可以从此不问世事
You will walk away and never ever...

1278
01:14:28,986 --> 01:14:31,061
以你性命担保？
Your life?

1279
01:14:32,219 --> 01:14:33,846


1280
01:14:42,104 --> 01:14:43,814


1281
01:14:47,588 --> 01:14:48,582
布斯
Bruce.

1282
01:14:49,278 --> 01:14:50,737


1283
01:14:55,117 --> 01:14:56,702


1284
01:14:59,246 --> 01:15:00,247


1285
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:14,344


1286
01:15:15,429 --> 01:15:16,763


1287
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,352


1288
01:15:25,459 --> 01:15:26,125
水平翻转机身，朝南前进！
Bring the carrier about to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1289
01:15:26,126 --> 01:15:28,616
水平翻转机身，朝南前进！
Bring the carrier about to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1290
01:15:28,754 --> 01:15:30,627
- 飞到海面 - 我们失去了导航
- Take us to the water! - We're flying blind.

1291
01:15:30,756 --> 01:15:32,747
导航系统在重新校准
Navigation's recalibrating after the engine failure.

1292
01:15:32,883 --> 01:15:34,625
还没日出吗？
Is the sun coming up?

1293
01:15:35,385 --> 01:15:37,591
- 对 - 对照太阳找方向
- Yes, sir. - Then put it on the left.

1294
01:15:37,721 --> 01:15:39,380
飞到海面
Get us over water.

1295
01:15:39,515 --> 01:15:41,590
再多个引擎失事，就会坠机
One more turbine goes down, and we drop.

1296
01:15:42,289 --> 01:15:43,707


1297
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:45,125
- 谢谢
- Thanks.

1298
01:15:48,482 --> 01:15:49,644
史塔
Stark!

1299
01:15:52,361 --> 01:15:54,020
史塔，我来了
Stark, I'm here!

1300
01:15:54,092 --> 01:15:55,302
好
Good.

1301
01:15:56,865 --> 01:15:58,857
看下情况如何
Let's see what we've got.

1302
01:15:58,992 --> 01:16:00,651
我要让这个超导制冷系统
I got to get this superconducting coolant system

1303
01:16:00,786 --> 01:16:01,781
重运作
back online

1304
01:16:01,912 --> 01:16:03,370
接近回转轴前
before I can access the rotors,

1305
01:16:03,497 --> 01:16:05,323
我要清理残骸
work on dislodging the debris.

1306
01:16:07,876 --> 01:16:09,417
你到引擎控制箱
I need you to get to that engine control panel

1307
01:16:09,545 --> 01:16:13,209
告诉我哪个继电器超荷
and tell me which relays are in overload position.

1308
01:16:13,987 --> 01:16:15,322


1309
01:16:25,518 --> 01:16:27,059
控制箱是怎样的？
What does it look like in there?

1310
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:30,307
一堆电路板的样子吗？
It seems to run on some form of electricity.

1311
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,182
你说得没错
Well, you're not wrong.

1312
01:16:36,843 --> 01:16:39,012


1313
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:47,854


1314
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:50,857


1315
01:17:07,332 --> 01:17:08,333


1316
01:17:10,585 --> 01:17:11,586


1317
01:17:25,892 --> 01:17:27,060


1318
01:17:27,144 --> 01:17:28,145


1319
01:17:32,566 --> 01:17:33,567


1320
01:17:36,005 --> 01:17:38,839
我们不是你的敌人，班纳
We are not your enemies, Banner.

1321
01:17:38,966 --> 01:17:39,961
醒醒
- Try to think!

1322
01:17:43,618 --> 01:17:45,871


1323
01:17:50,103 --> 01:17:51,975
继电器正常了
Okay, the relays are intact.

1324
01:17:52,105 --> 01:17:53,562
接下来呢？
What's our next move?

1325
01:17:53,689 --> 01:17:54,684
即使我修复回转轴
Even if I clear the rotors,

1326
01:17:54,816 --> 01:17:57,021
这东西也要借外力才能动起来
this thing won't re-engage without a jump.

1327
01:17:57,151 --> 01:17:58,526
我要入内推动
I'm going to have to get in there and push.

1328
01:17:58,653 --> 01:18:00,395
如果转速加剧，会搅碎你
If that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded.

1329
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:02,521
定子控制单元能翻转磁极
That stator control unit can reverse the polarity

1330
01:18:02,657 --> 01:18:04,067
会有足够时间脱离磁浮力
long enough to disengage maglev and that could...

1331
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,527
听不懂
Speak English!

1332
01:18:06,869 --> 01:18:07,983
看到红色扳手吗？
You see that red lever?

1333
01:18:09,288 --> 01:18:11,410
可以降低转速，提供足够时间让我出去
It will slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out.

1334
01:18:11,541 --> 01:18:13,331
就位，等我信号
Stand by it. Wait for my word.

1335
01:18:16,026 --> 01:18:17,194


1336
01:18:23,158 --> 01:18:24,993


1337
01:18:43,512 --> 01:18:44,679


1338
01:18:49,184 --> 01:18:50,185


1339
01:18:54,314 --> 01:18:55,399


1340
01:19:00,695 --> 01:19:01,696


1341
01:19:05,927 --> 01:19:07,718
要清空下层机舱
We need full evac on the lower hangar bay.

1342
01:19:10,932 --> 01:19:11,963
手榴弹！
Grenade!

1343
01:19:12,499 --> 01:19:13,500


1344
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:18,755


1345
01:19:22,342 --> 01:19:23,343


1346
01:19:27,115 --> 01:19:28,443
有入侵者
We've got a perimeter breach!

1347
01:19:28,575 --> 01:19:30,614
有人入侵神盾局
Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. gear.

1348
01:19:30,744 --> 01:19:32,819
各就各位
Call-outs at every junction.

1349
01:19:38,525 --> 01:19:39,526


1350
01:19:40,128 --> 01:19:42,334
绿巨人和托尔在第四层实验室
We have the Hulk and Thor on Research Level 4.

1351
01:19:42,464 --> 01:19:44,005
二三两层没信号
Levels 2 and 3 are dark.

1352
01:19:44,132 --> 01:19:46,254
长官，绿巨人会摧毁整艘船
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

1353
01:19:47,469 --> 01:19:48,464
转移他注意力
Get his attention.

1354
01:19:48,595 --> 01:19:52,758
护航舰6-0到Y形区迎战
Escort 6-0, proceed to Wishbone and engage hostile.

1355
01:19:52,891 --> 01:19:54,170
别靠得太近
Don't get too close.

1356
01:19:54,309 --> 01:19:55,683
收到
Copy.

1357
01:20:07,614 --> 01:20:08,988
发现目标
Target acquired.

1358
01:20:09,556 --> 01:20:11,558

01:20:13,286 --> 01:20:14,281
锁定目标
Target engaged.

1360
01:20:22,736 --> 01:20:24,237


1361
01:20:25,924 --> 01:20:27,465
目标发飙了
Target angry, target angry!

1362
01:20:48,178 --> 01:20:49,804


1363
01:21:08,114 --> 01:21:09,115


1364
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:12,869


1365
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:16,414


1366
01:21:17,582 --> 01:21:18,792


1367
01:21:20,252 --> 01:21:21,253


1368
01:21:34,516 --> 01:21:35,517


1369
01:21:35,869 --> 01:21:38,074
他们不准备攻破这里，那究竟…
They're not getting through here, so what the hell...

1370
01:21:38,853 --> 01:21:39,980


1371
01:21:48,655 --> 01:21:50,615


1372
01:21:51,682 --> 01:21:53,611
（一号引擎出现故障）

1373
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:55,328


1374
01:21:56,472 --> 01:21:58,713
一号引擎停止运行
Engine one is now in shut-down.

1375
01:22:02,168 --> 01:22:03,503


1376
01:22:07,149 --> 01:22:09,307

01:22:19,578 --> 01:22:21,700
我是罗曼诺夫
This is Agent Romanoff.

1382
01:22:21,831 --> 01:22:23,288
收到
I copy.

1383

史塔，我们要坠毁了
Stark, we're losing altitude.

1384
01:22:29,046 --> 01:22:30,504
我知道了
Yeah, I noticed.

1385
01:22:52,385 --> 01:22:53,762


1386
01:22:59,351 --> 01:23:00,352
不
No!

1387
01:23:08,169 --> 01:23:10,872
这招对你真是屡试不爽
Are you ever not going to fall for that?

1388
01:23:12,197 --> 01:23:14,532


1389
01:23:25,919 --> 01:23:26,920


1390
01:23:30,423 --> 01:23:32,300


1391
01:23:37,138 --> 01:23:39,265


1392
01:23:42,686 --> 01:23:43,687


1393
01:23:53,881 --> 01:23:56,122
人类认为我们是不死之身
The humans think us immortal.

1394
01:23:57,218 --> 01:23:58,759
要试下吗？
Should we test that?

1395
01:23:58,785 --> 01:23:59,786


1396
01:24:01,555 --> 01:24:02,752
请让开
Move away, please.

1397
01:24:07,228 --> 01:24:08,721
喜欢吗？
You like this?

1398
01:24:09,688 --> 01:24:12,938
自你派来毁灭者后，我们就开始研制
We started working on the prototype after you sent the Destroyer.

1399
01:24:14,151 --> 01:24:16,392
我不知道它能干什么
Even I don't know what it does.

1400
01:24:17,196 --> 01:24:18,440
想见识下吗？
- Do you want to find out?

1401
01:24:18,972 --> 01:24:20,140

娜塔莎
Natasha?

1410
01:25:37,801 --> 01:25:39,135


1411
01:25:43,389 --> 01:25:44,390


1412
01:25:58,488 --> 01:26:00,240


1413
01:26:04,427 --> 01:26:06,170
你必败无疑
You're going to lose.

1414
01:26:08,223 --> 01:26:09,420
是吗
Am I?

1415
01:26:10,725 --> 01:26:13,215
你本性使然
It's in your nature.

1416
01:26:15,397 --> 01:26:17,721
你们的团队四分五裂
Your heroes are scattered.

1417
01:26:17,857 --> 01:26:21,557
你们空中要塞要堕落
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

1418
01:26:21,694 --> 01:26:23,318
我有何弱点？
Where is my disadvantage?

1419
01:26:23,988 --> 01:26:26,063
你缺乏信念
You lack conviction.

1420
01:26:26,908 --> 01:26:27,903
我不觉得…
I don't think I'm...

1421
01:26:27,809 --> 01:26:29,269


1422
01:26:34,749 --> 01:26:36,458
原来有这样的威力
So, that's what it does.

1423
01:26:36,317 --> 01:26:37,944


1424
01:26:55,128 --> 01:26:55,962


1425
01:27:09,283 --> 01:27:10,278
队长，拉动扳手
Cap, hit the lever.

1426
01:27:10,659 --> 01:27:13,232
要等一下
I need a minute here!

1427
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:14,448
快拉
Lever

1428
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:15,693
马上
now!

1429
01:27:25,241 --> 01:27:26,326
哦 吼
Uh-oh.

1430
01:27:27,676 --> 01:27:28,790
救命
Help!

1431
01:27:28,995 --> 01:27:30,079


1432
01:27:31,497 --> 01:27:32,498


1433
01:27:43,676 --> 01:27:45,178


1434
01:27:46,262 --> 01:27:47,847


1435
01:28:04,421 --> 01:28:05,796
对不起，老大
Sorry, boss.

1436
01:28:05,923 --> 01:28:07,630
那家伙走了
The god rabbited.

1437
01:28:07,758 --> 01:28:09,216
保持清醒
Just stay awake.

1438
01:28:09,343 --> 01:28:10,966
看着我
Eyes on me.

1439
01:28:11,095 --> 01:28:12,636
我不行了
No, I'm clocking out here.

1440
01:28:12,763 --> 01:28:14,256
振作
Not an option.

1441
01:28:15,265 --> 01:28:17,222
没事的，老大
It's okay, boss.

1442
01:28:19,144 --> 01:28:21,183
这样下去不行的
This was never gonna work

1443
01:28:21,313 --> 01:28:22,593
除非他们能…
if they didn't have something

1444
01:28:23,883 --> 01:28:25,343
to...

1445
01:28:54,596 --> 01:28:56,422
古逊特工倒下了
Agent Coulson is down.

1446
01:28:57,808 --> 01:28:59,515
医疗部队正赶来
A medical team is on its way to your location.

1447
01:28:59,643 --> 01:29:01,101
他们已到了
They're here.

1448
01:29:04,314 --> 01:29:05,938
有人叫了
They called it.

1449
01:29:22,416 --> 01:29:24,039
在费尔·古逊外套里找到的
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

1450
01:29:27,379 --> 01:29:29,501
估计没来得及找你签名
I guess he never did get you to sign them.

1451
01:29:33,010 --> 01:29:34,669
我们在空中孤立无助
We're dead in the air up here.

1452
01:29:34,803 --> 01:29:37,887
通讯被断，立方又找不到
Our communications, the location of the Cube,

1453
01:29:38,015 --> 01:29:40,421
班纳和托尔不知所踪
Banner, Thor...

1454
01:29:41,727 --> 01:29:43,635
我也无能为力
I got nothing for you.

1455
01:29:43,771 --> 01:29:46,687
我失去了我的心腹
I lost my one good eye.

1456
01:29:49,734 --> 01:29:52,734
或许我罪有应得
Maybe I had that coming.

1457
01:29:56,893 --> 01:29:58,227
是
Yes,

1458
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:02,743
我们打算利用立方制作武器
we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract.

1459
01:30:04,207 --> 01:30:06,115
但我没全把赌注压在这个上
I never put all my chips on that number, though

1460
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:09,286
因为还有更值得一赌的东西
because I was playing something even riskier.

1461
01:30:13,257 --> 01:30:17,384
有个构思，史塔也知道的
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

1462
01:30:19,263 --> 01:30:22,596
称为复仇者计划
called the Avengers Initiative.

1463
01:30:23,810 --> 01:30:28,599
构思是聚集天赋异禀的人士
The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people

1464
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:32,233
看他们能否有更大作为
to see if they could become something more.

1465
01:30:33,611 --> 01:30:37,774
能否在需要时齐心协力
To see if they could work together when we needed them to,

1466
01:30:37,907 --> 01:30:41,240
应对本无胜算的战斗
to fight the battles that we never could.

1467
01:30:43,996 --> 01:30:48,823
古逊直到死前仍坚信此构思
Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea.

1468
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:52,829
坚信你们会不负所托
In heroes.

1469
01:31:00,873 --> 01:31:02,500
好
Well,

1470
01:31:03,349 --> 01:31:06,017
这构思已过时
it's an old-fashioned notion.

1471
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:28,820
你从天上掉下来
You fell out of the sky.

1472
01:31:38,411 --> 01:31:39,787


1473
01:31:42,847 --> 01:31:44,340
没砸伤到谁吧？
Did I hurt anybody?

1474
01:31:44,474 --> 01:31:47,509
没有
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

1475
01:31:47,643 --> 01:31:50,928
只是吓坏了鸽子而已
You did scare the hell out of some pigeons, though.

1476
01:31:51,773 --> 01:31:52,803
真好运
Lucky.

1477
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:54,564
或者下落点选得好
Or just good aim.

1478
01:31:54,692 --> 01:31:56,269
你掉下来时还醒着
You were awake when you fell.

1479
01:31:58,362 --> 01:32:00,401
- 你看到了？ - 全程看到
- You saw? - The whole thing.

1480
01:32:00,531 --> 01:32:02,155
砸穿屋顶
Right through the ceiling.

1481
01:32:02,283 --> 01:32:06,232
又大又绿，一丝不挂
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

1482
01:32:06,370 --> 01:32:07,484
给
Here.

1483
01:32:08,873 --> 01:32:13,574
你恢复了正常尺寸，就能穿上这衣服
Didn't think those would fit you until you shrunk down to a regular-size feller.

1484
01:32:15,922 --> 01:32:17,201
多谢
Thank you.

1485
01:32:18,216 --> 01:32:19,460
你是外星人？
Are you an alien?

1486
01:32:20,051 --> 01:32:21,248
什么？
What?

1487
01:32:21,552 --> 01:32:22,880
来自外太空的外星人
From outer space, an alien.

1488
01:32:23,206 --> 01:32:24,248
不
No.

1489
01:32:24,889 --> 01:32:28,008
小子，你病得不轻
Well, then, son, you've got a condition.

1490
01:32:37,011 --> 01:32:38,262


1491
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:41,185
克林，你会没事的
Clint. You're going to be all right.

1492
01:32:44,533 --> 01:32:46,608
你知道？
You know that?

1493
01:32:45,686 --> 01:32:46,812


1494
01:32:47,452 --> 01:32:49,325
你知道那感觉？
Is that what you know?

1495
01:32:51,790 --> 01:32:54,659
我无法呼吸
I've got no window.

1496
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:56,836
我要赶他出去
I have to flush him out.

1497
01:32:57,754 --> 01:32:59,580
总得要花些时间恢复
You got to level out. It's going to take time.

1498
01:32:59,714 --> 01:33:01,256
你不明白
You don't understand.

1499
01:33:03,218 --> 01:33:06,467
你被他人控制过思想吗？
Have you ever had someone take your brain and play?

1500
01:33:07,264 --> 01:33:11,426
自我被赶走，用其他代替
Pull you out and stuff something else in?

1501
01:33:14,604 --> 01:33:16,976
明白心智被摧毁的感觉吗？
Do you know what it's like to be unmade?

1502
01:33:18,525 --> 01:33:20,896
你知道我有过
You know that I do.

1503
01:33:28,493 --> 01:33:29,524
我怎么苏醒的
Why am I back?

1504
01:33:30,662 --> 01:33:32,036
你怎么赶走他的？
How did you get him out?

1505
01:33:32,164 --> 01:33:34,998
重校你的思想
Cognitive recalibration.

1506
01:33:35,125 --> 01:33:37,829
我狠狠地打了你的脑袋
I hit you really hard on the head.

1507
01:33:37,961 --> 01:33:39,039
多谢
Thanks.

1508
01:33:43,341 --> 01:33:45,084
娜塔莎
Natasha...

1509
01:33:45,761 --> 01:33:46,839
我杀了多少特工
How many agents did I...

1510
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:48,428
别说了
Don't.

1511
01:33:48,555 --> 01:33:50,760
别这样折磨自己
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

1512
01:33:51,349 --> 01:33:53,056
拜洛基所赐
This is Loki.

1513
01:33:53,185 --> 01:33:55,805
拜魔鬼和魔法所赐
This is monsters and magic,

1514
01:33:55,937 --> 01:33:57,561
这种事情难以预料
and nothing we were ever trained for.

1515
01:33:57,689 --> 01:33:59,230
洛基逃掉了？
Loki, did he get away?

1516
01:33:59,051 --> 01:34:00,052


1517
01:34:00,692 --> 01:34:02,933
你应该不知道他去哪了
I don't suppose you know where.

1518
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:04,860
我不可能知道
I didn't need to know.

1519
01:34:04,988 --> 01:34:06,731
我也没问
I didn't ask.

1520
01:34:09,993 --> 01:34:12,483
他很快会有所行动
He's going to make his play soon, though.

1521
01:34:12,829 --> 01:34:13,824
就在今天
Today.

1522
01:34:13,955 --> 01:34:15,283
我们要阻止他
We got to stop him.

1523
01:34:15,957 --> 01:34:17,201
我们？
Yeah? Who's "we"?

1524
01:34:17,334 --> 01:34:19,290
包括剩下的人吧
I don't know. Whoever's left.

1525
01:34:20,531 --> 01:34:21,907
好
Well,

1526
01:34:23,548 --> 01:34:25,706
如果我射中洛基的眼眶
if I put an arrow through Loki's eye socket,

1527
01:34:25,842 --> 01:34:28,546
我定会高枕无忧
I would sleep better, I suppose.

1528
01:34:31,390 --> 01:34:32,966
你终于没事了
Now you sound like you.

1529
01:34:33,683 --> 01:34:35,141
那你呢
But you don't.

1530
01:34:37,062 --> 01:34:39,896
你只是间谍，不是士兵
You're a spy, not a soldier.

1531
01:34:40,023 --> 01:34:44,768
你却要参战，为什么？
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

1532
01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:48,486
洛基对你做了什么？
What did Loki do to you?

1533
01:34:49,241 --> 01:34:51,647
不关他的事，我只是…
He didn't. I just...

1534
01:34:55,414 --> 01:34:56,955
娜塔莎
Natasha.

1535
01:34:59,042 --> 01:35:01,034
我也被洗脑过
I've been compromised.

1536
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:06,253
我背负了不少血债
I got red in my ledger.

1537
01:35:08,385 --> 01:35:10,460
我要赎罪
I would like to wipe it out.

1538
01:35:26,485 --> 01:35:27,978
他结婚了吗
Was he married?

1539
01:35:28,112 --> 01:35:29,522
没有
No.

1540
01:35:29,655 --> 01:35:33,866
有个拉大提琴的女友吧
There was a cellist, I think.

1541
01:35:35,453 --> 01:35:36,862
我很难过
I'm sorry.

1542
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:39,239
他貌似人不错
He seemed like a good man.

1543
01:35:40,541 --> 01:35:41,619
他是个笨蛋
He was an idiot.

1544
01:35:41,751 --> 01:35:43,991
为什么，因为他的信念？
Why? For believing?

1545
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,538
单独对抗洛基
For taking on Loki alone.

1546
01:35:45,671 --> 01:35:47,378
他只是忠于职守
He was doing his job.

1547
01:35:47,506 --> 01:35:50,043
不应该由他对付洛基
He was out of his league. He should have waited.

1548
01:35:50,176 --> 01:35:51,206
他应该…
He should have...

1549
01:35:51,343 --> 01:35:52,920
总有不由自主的时候
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

1550
01:35:53,054 --> 01:35:55,175
我明白
Right, I've heard that before.

1551
01:35:55,306 --> 01:35:56,799
你第一次看到士兵死亡？
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

1552
01:35:56,932 --> 01:35:58,723
我们不是士兵
We are not soldiers.

1553
01:36:03,189 --> 01:36:04,931
我不是霍利的手下
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

1554
01:36:05,066 --> 01:36:06,227
我也不是
Neither am I.

1555
01:36:06,358 --> 01:36:08,564
他和洛基一样手染鲜血
He's got the same blood on his hands that Loki does.

1556
01:36:08,694 --> 01:36:10,068
现在，我们要摒弃前嫌
But right now, we got to put that behind us

1557
01:36:10,196 --> 01:36:12,401
齐心协力解决事情
and get this done.

1558
01:36:12,531 --> 01:36:13,526
洛基需要能源
Loki needs a power source.

1559
01:36:13,657 --> 01:36:14,652
如果我们可以列出…
If we can put together a list...

1560
01:36:14,784 --> 01:36:15,778
他喜欢挑拨离间
He made it personal.

1561
01:36:15,951 --> 01:36:16,982
这不要紧
That's not the point.

1562
01:36:17,119 --> 01:36:19,490
这就是洛基的意图
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

1563
01:36:19,622 --> 01:36:21,530
他为什么会袭击我们的飞船？
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

1564
01:36:21,665 --> 01:36:22,660
分裂我们
To tear us apart.

1565
01:36:22,792 --> 01:36:24,664
对，逐个击破
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

1566
01:36:24,794 --> 01:36:27,248
只有除掉我们，他才会赢，对不？
but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?

1567
01:36:27,379 --> 01:36:28,921
这就是他的目的
That's what he wants.

1568
01:36:29,048 --> 01:36:31,538
他想击败我们，并被世人知道
He wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it.

1569
01:36:31,675 --> 01:36:32,789
他想要观众
He wants an audience.

1570
01:36:33,511 --> 01:36:35,170
对， 我知道他在斯图加特的所作所为
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

1571
01:36:35,304 --> 01:36:38,221
对，那只是预告，现在才是首映
Yeah, that was just previews. This is opening night.

1572
01:36:38,349 --> 01:36:40,886
洛基是公主病患者
And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

1573
01:36:41,018 --> 01:36:42,595
他渴望鲜花，关注
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

1574
01:36:42,728 --> 01:36:46,511
他想要座铭刻其名的擎天大厦
He wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered...

1575
01:36:48,275 --> 01:36:49,852
糟糕了
Son of a bitch.

1576
01:36:54,417 --> 01:36:56,316
（史塔大厦）

1577
01:37:01,122 --> 01:37:02,152
该走了
Time to go.

1578
01:37:02,289 --> 01:37:03,831
- 去哪？ - 路上会告诉你
- Go where? - I'll tell you on the way.

1579
01:37:03,958 --> 01:37:04,953
会开飞机吗？
Can you fly one of those jets?

1580
01:37:06,544 --> 01:37:07,788
我会
I can.

1581
01:37:11,674 --> 01:37:12,704
有制服吗？
You got a suit?

1582
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:13,621


1583
01:37:13,968 --> 01:37:15,426
换上
Then suit up.

1584
01:37:26,884 --> 01:37:29,261


1585
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:32,431


1586
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:44,360
你们无权来此
Hey, you guys aren't authorised to be in here.

1587
01:37:44,498 --> 01:37:46,823
别多管闲事
Son, just don't.

1588
01:37:48,948 --> 01:37:49,907
长官
Sir.

1589
01:37:50,004 --> 01:37:51,201
希尔特工
Agent Hill.

1590
01:37:51,756 --> 01:37:53,297
这些卡片
Those cards,

1591
01:37:55,425 --> 01:37:59,885
可是在古逊的柜子里找到的
they were in Coulson's locker, not in his jacket.

1592
01:38:04,309 --> 01:38:05,885
不然他们就没动力干活
They needed the push.

1593
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:11,268
6号停机坪有人擅自起飞
We have an unauthorised departure from Bay 6.

1594
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:13,477
他们找到洛基了
They found him.

1595
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:18,018
尽快恢复通讯
Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do.

1596
01:38:18,156 --> 01:38:20,397
- 我要掌握情况 - 遵命
- I want eyes on everything. - Yes, sir.

1597
01:38:26,485 --> 01:38:28,320


1598
01:38:33,963 --> 01:38:35,706
我已关闭弦反应炉堆
Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor

1599
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:39,671
但立方已经自我运作
but the device is already self-sustaining.

1600
01:38:39,803 --> 01:38:41,960
关掉，绍韦博士
Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.

1601
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:43,918
太迟了
It's too late!

1602
01:38:45,975 --> 01:38:47,433
停不下来了
She can't stop now.

1603
01:38:48,478 --> 01:38:50,933
它要向我们展示…
She wants to show us something!

1604
01:38:51,064 --> 01:38:53,102
一个全新的宇宙
A new universe.

1605
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:54,388
Okay.

1606
01:38:57,224 --> 01:38:58,892


1607
01:39:01,825 --> 01:39:03,697
是纯能量防护罩
The barrier is pure energy.

1608
01:39:03,827 --> 01:39:05,699
无法击破
It's unbreachable.

1609
01:39:05,829 --> 01:39:07,619
明白
Yeah, I got that.

1610
01:39:08,832 --> 01:39:09,826
实行B计划
Plan B.

1611
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,075
装甲MK7型号仍未准备好
Sir, the Mark 7 is not ready for deployment.

1612
01:39:13,211 --> 01:39:15,452
那就不要转轮了，没时间了
Then skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock.

1613
01:39:35,191 --> 01:39:38,227
你来求我大发慈悲？
Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity.

1614
01:39:39,362 --> 01:39:41,733
其实我是来吓你的
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.

1615
01:39:41,865 --> 01:39:43,322
你最好穿上盔甲
You should have left your armour on for that.

1616
01:39:43,437 --> 01:39:44,897
Yeah.

1617
01:39:44,993 --> 01:39:46,071
没多大用处
It's seen a bit of mileage,

1618
01:39:46,202 --> 01:39:48,823
你可是拿着命运光杖
and you've got the glow stick of destiny.

1619
01:39:49,622 --> 01:39:51,910
喝一杯吗？
Would you like a drink?

1620
01:39:52,041 --> 01:39:53,155
拖延时间是没用的
Stalling me won't change anything.

1621
01:39:53,293 --> 01:39:55,415
不，是恐吓你
No, no. Threatening.

1622
01:39:55,545 --> 01:39:56,919
不喝？确定？
No drink? Are you sure?

1623
01:39:57,046 --> 01:39:58,588
那我自己喝
I'm having one.

1624
01:39:59,632 --> 01:40:03,546
智塔利军队将至，已成大局
The Chitauri are coming. Nothing will change that.

1625
01:40:04,429 --> 01:40:05,839
我还有什么好怕的？
What have I to fear?

1626
01:40:05,972 --> 01:40:07,679
复仇者联盟
The Avengers.

1627
01:40:09,768 --> 01:40:12,092
这是我们团队的名字
That's what we call ourselves. We're sort of like a team.

1628
01:40:12,228 --> 01:40:13,852
类似漫威动画「地球最强战队」
"Earth's mightiest heroes" -type thing.

1629
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:15,853
见识过了
Yes, I've met them.

1630
01:40:15,761 --> 01:40:16,845


1631
01:40:17,150 --> 01:40:18,312
花了一些功夫才团结起来
It takes us a while to get any traction,

1632
01:40:18,443 --> 01:40:19,438
保证吓死你
I'll give you that one.

1633
01:40:19,569 --> 01:40:21,774
来点个人数吧
But let's do a head count, here.

1634
01:40:21,905 --> 01:40:24,395
你的半人神兄弟
Your brother, the demigod,

1635
01:40:26,117 --> 01:40:29,699
由传奇中苏醒过来的超级士兵
a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend.

1636
01:40:29,829 --> 01:40:32,995
怒火冲天的绿巨人
A man with breathtaking anger-management issues,

1637
01:40:33,124 --> 01:40:36,208
一对大师级刺客，可惜你…
a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella,

1638
01:40:36,835 --> 01:40:39,788
得罪了他们每一个
you've managed to piss off every single one of them.

1639
01:40:39,922 --> 01:40:40,916
这就是计划
That was the plan.

1640
01:40:41,048 --> 01:40:43,039
不咋样
Not a great plan.

1641
01:40:43,175 --> 01:40:45,213
等他们进来
When they come,

1642
01:40:45,344 --> 01:40:46,802
绝对会来
and they will,

1643
01:40:46,929 --> 01:40:48,173
冲着你而来
they'll come for you.

1644
01:40:48,305 --> 01:40:49,300
我有军队
I have an army.

1645
01:40:49,431 --> 01:40:50,593
我们有绿巨人
We have a Hulk.

1646
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:52,474
我还以为那绿怪兽走了
I thought the beast had wandered off.

1647
01:40:52,601 --> 01:40:54,509
你没有搞清楚，这里没有王座
You're missing the point. There is no throne.

1648
01:40:54,645 --> 01:40:58,642
你不可能称王称霸
There is no version of this where you come out on top.

1649
01:40:58,774 --> 01:41:01,098
即使我们无法击败你的军队
Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us,

1650
01:41:01,235 --> 01:41:03,226
那也要怪你
but it's all on you.

1651
01:41:04,029 --> 01:41:05,107
如果拯救不了世界
Because if we can't protect the Earth,

1652
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:08,399
我们会找你复仇
you can be damn well sure we'll avenge it.

1653
01:41:10,452 --> 01:41:13,488
如果你和他们翻脸了
How will your friends have time for me

1654
01:41:13,622 --> 01:41:15,412
还会有时间对付我吗？
when they are so busy fighting you?

1655
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:23,870
通常会成功的
This usually works.

1656
01:41:24,007 --> 01:41:26,842
发挥失常，不算稀奇
Well, performance issues, it's not uncommon.

1657
01:41:26,969 --> 01:41:28,877
五个男人就有一个不举
One out of five...

1658
01:41:30,347 --> 01:41:30,888
佐维斯，行了吧
Jarvis, anytime now.

1659
01:41:30,889 --> 01:41:33,261
佐维斯，行了吧
Jarvis, anytime now.

1660
01:41:35,018 --> 01:41:37,769
你们将臣服于我
You will all fall before me.

1661
01:41:37,896 --> 01:41:39,271
启动
Deploy!

1662
01:41:39,398 --> 01:41:40,808
启动
Deploy!

1663
01:41:42,014 --> 01:41:43,307


1664
01:42:04,328 --> 01:42:06,330


1665
01:42:08,010 --> 01:42:10,963
你还得罪了另一个人
And there's one other person you pissed off.

1666
01:42:12,097 --> 01:42:13,341
他叫费尔
His name was Phil.

1667
01:42:14,421 --> 01:42:15,964


1668
01:42:37,122 --> 01:42:38,615
不妙了
Right.

1669
01:42:38,749 --> 01:42:39,993
敌军来了
Army.

1670
01:42:44,243 --> 01:42:45,619


1671
01:43:02,386 --> 01:43:04,596


1672
01:43:07,307 --> 01:43:09,017


1673
01:43:22,573 --> 01:43:24,449


1674
01:43:26,285 --> 01:43:27,536


1675
01:43:34,459 --> 01:43:36,128


1676
01:43:52,363 --> 01:43:53,643
洛基！
Loki!

1677
01:43:53,781 --> 01:43:55,820
关闭立方，否则我就摧毁它
Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it.

1678
01:43:55,950 --> 01:43:56,980
你摧毁不了的
You can't.

1679
01:43:57,118 --> 01:43:58,991
大局已定
There is no stopping it.

1680
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:00,910
唯有
There is only

1681
01:44:01,038 --> 01:44:02,152
开战
the war.

1682
01:44:02,290 --> 01:44:03,403
放马过来
So be it.

1683
01:44:03,322 --> 01:44:04,948


1684
01:44:09,411 --> 01:44:10,412


1685
01:44:16,168 --> 01:44:17,169


1686
01:44:19,671 --> 01:44:21,423


1687
01:44:25,521 --> 01:44:27,264
史塔，我们在你三点钟方向，朝东北来
Stark, we're on your three, headed northeast.

1688
01:44:27,398 --> 01:44:29,520
什么？你们路上还有闲情用膳？
What? Did you stop for drive-through?

1689
01:44:29,650 --> 01:44:31,357
快到帕克街，我会引敌人过来
Swing up Park. I'm going to lay them out for you.

1690
01:44:34,728 --> 01:44:35,729


1691
01:44:44,863 --> 01:44:46,031


1692
01:44:49,420 --> 01:44:50,748
长官，又多了一批
Sir, we have more incoming.

1693
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:52,622
行，别让他们消停
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

1694
01:44:56,083 --> 01:44:57,709


1695
01:44:59,514 --> 01:45:01,386
- 娜塔莎？ - 我看到他了
- Nat? - I see him.

1696
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:04,383


1697
01:45:09,763 --> 01:45:10,764


1698
01:45:14,434 --> 01:45:15,727


1699
01:45:18,855 --> 01:45:20,399


1700
01:45:36,248 --> 01:45:37,916


1701
01:45:45,727 --> 01:45:47,932
我们得回到上面
We got to get back up there.

1702
01:45:49,886 --> 01:45:51,763


1703
01:46:04,735 --> 01:46:06,695


1704
01:46:35,682 --> 01:46:36,683


1705
01:46:39,279 --> 01:46:40,938
史塔，看到了吗？
Stark, are you seeing this?

1706
01:46:41,698 --> 01:46:44,153
看到了，难以置信
Seeing.Still working on believing.

1707
01:46:44,284 --> 01:46:45,658
班纳呢？来了吗？
Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?

1708
01:46:45,786 --> 01:46:46,816
班纳？
Banner?

1709
01:46:46,953 --> 01:46:47,984
有进展就告诉我
Just keep me posted.

1710
01:46:48,705 --> 01:46:50,863
佐维斯，找出它们的弱点
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

1711
01:46:53,126 --> 01:46:54,999
看这
Look at this!

1712
01:46:55,128 --> 01:46:56,123
看你周围
Look around you!

1713
01:46:57,130 --> 01:47:00,997
这场混乱会随着你的统治而告终吗？
You think this madness will end with your rule?

1714
01:47:01,134 --> 01:47:02,627
太迟了
It's too late.

1715
01:47:04,137 --> 01:47:05,381
为时已晚
It's too late to stop it.

1716
01:47:05,514 --> 01:47:09,380
只要我们齐心，就能做到
No. We can, together.

1717
01:47:11,968 --> 01:47:13,053


1718
01:47:15,982 --> 01:47:18,104
你又感情用事
Sentiment.

1719
01:47:19,726 --> 01:47:20,936


1720
01:47:23,688 --> 01:47:24,481


1721
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:48,216
仍有一些市民困在这里
We've got civilians still trapped up here.

1722
01:47:49,391 --> 01:47:50,386
洛基
Loki.

1723
01:47:50,882 --> 01:47:52,217


1724
01:48:02,028 --> 01:48:03,819
这些人需要帮助
They're fish in a barrel down there.

1725
01:48:09,286 --> 01:48:11,242
这里交给我们，去吧
We got this. It's good. Go.

1726
01:48:11,371 --> 01:48:12,745
你们能牵制他们？
Do you think you can hold them off?

1727
01:48:12,873 --> 01:48:13,867
队长
Captain,

1728
01:48:15,876 --> 01:48:18,710
乐意之极
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1729
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:38,430


1730
01:48:41,016 --> 01:48:42,893


1731
01:48:45,571 --> 01:48:47,278
令我想起在布达佩斯的情形
Just like Budapest all over again.

1732
01:48:47,907 --> 01:48:50,397
看来你我对布达佩斯的印象大不相同
You and I remember Budapest very differently.

1733
01:49:06,550 --> 01:49:08,956
国民兵要一小时后才到达
It's going to be an hour before they can scramble the National Guard.

1734
01:49:09,095 --> 01:49:10,885
国民兵？
National Guard?

1735
01:49:11,847 --> 01:49:13,341
军方了解这里的情况吗？
Does the army know what's happening here?

1736
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:14,594
我们了解吗？
Do we?

1737
01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:17,007
派人进去这几栋楼
You need men in these buildings.

1738
01:49:17,144 --> 01:49:19,968
里面的人处境危险
There are people inside and they're going to be running right into the line of fire.

1739
01:49:20,106 --> 01:49:22,014
你们保护他们到地下室或者地铁
You take them to the basements or through the subway.

1740
01:49:22,149 --> 01:49:23,726
不要出现在街面上
You keep them off the streets.

1741
01:49:23,859 --> 01:49:26,480
封锁这里至第39街
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

1742
01:49:26,612 --> 01:49:28,236
为什么要听你指挥？
Why the hell should I take orders from you?

1743
01:49:42,294 --> 01:49:43,491
派人进去这几栋楼
I need men in those buildings.

1744
01:49:43,629 --> 01:49:45,704
带他们离开街面
Lead the people down and away from the streets.

1745
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:48,412
封锁这里至第39街
We're going to set up a perimeter all the way down to 39th Street.

1746
01:49:57,342 --> 01:49:58,510


1747
01:49:58,811 --> 01:50:00,388
吸引它注意了
Well, we got its attention.

1748
01:50:00,521 --> 01:50:02,394
下一步呢？
What the hell was step two?

1749
01:50:04,057 --> 01:50:06,101


1750
01:50:07,852 --> 01:50:08,770


1751
01:50:08,853 --> 01:50:10,230


1752
01:50:14,818 --> 01:50:16,194


1753
01:50:25,245 --> 01:50:26,997


1754
01:50:31,927 --> 01:50:32,922
上面情况如何？
What's the story upstairs?

1755
01:50:33,054 --> 01:50:34,962
无法穿透立方周围的能量罩
The power surrounding the Cube is impenetrable.

1756
01:50:35,097 --> 01:50:37,718
托尔说得对，先干掉这些家伙
Thor's right. We got to deal with these guys.

1757
01:50:37,850 --> 01:50:39,474
- 怎么做？ - 大家一起做
- How do we do this? - As a team.

1758
01:50:39,602 --> 01:50:40,881
我还要找洛基算账呢
I have unfinished business with Loki.

1759
01:50:41,437 --> 01:50:42,467
轮着来，别插队啊
Yeah? Well, get in line.

1760
01:50:42,605 --> 01:50:43,600
省省吧
Save it.

1761
01:50:43,731 --> 01:50:45,058
洛基会集中火力于我们
Loki's going to keep this fight focused on us,

1762
01:50:45,191 --> 01:50:46,221
正好如此
and that's what we need.

1763
01:50:46,358 --> 01:50:48,017
没有他，这些怪物会乱阵脚
Without him, these things could run wild.

1764
01:50:48,152 --> 01:50:51,105
史塔在上面，他需要我们…
We got Stark up top. He's going to need us to...

1765
01:50:49,894 --> 01:50:50,937


1766
01:50:58,454 --> 01:51:02,237
挺混乱的
So, this all seems horrible.

1767
01:51:02,708 --> 01:51:03,822
我见过更混乱的
I've seen worse.

1768
01:51:04,376 --> 01:51:05,371
对不起
Sorry.

1769
01:51:05,503 --> 01:51:08,171
我们要将场面弄得更混乱些
No, we could use a little worse.

1770
01:51:08,297 --> 01:51:10,704
- 史塔，他来了 - 班纳吗？
- Stark, we got him. - Banner?

1771
01:51:10,841 --> 01:51:12,085
你猜对了
Just like you said.

1772
01:51:12,218 --> 01:51:14,921
叫他快变身，马上好戏开场
Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.

1773
01:51:20,425 --> 01:51:21,176


1774
01:51:21,394 --> 01:51:23,469
这不是好戏吧
I don't see how that's a party.

1775
01:51:31,319 --> 01:51:32,314
班纳博士
Dr. Banner.

1776
01:51:34,072 --> 01:51:35,862
是时候愤怒了
Now might be a really good time for you to get angry.

1777
01:51:36,908 --> 01:51:39,363
这就是我的秘诀，队长
That's my secret, Captain.

1778
01:51:41,079 --> 01:51:42,323
我总是在发怒
I'm always angry...

1779
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:55,423
撑住
Hold on!

1780
01:52:05,804 --> 01:52:07,639


1781
01:52:09,182 --> 01:52:10,350


1782
01:52:10,433 --> 01:52:12,435


1783
01:52:25,331 --> 01:52:26,873
倾巢出动
Send the rest.

1784
01:52:33,631 --> 01:52:34,875
大家
Guys.

1785
01:52:35,008 --> 01:52:36,205
请发号施令，队长
Call it, Captain.

1786
01:52:36,342 --> 01:52:37,504
听好
All right, listen up.

1787
01:52:37,635 --> 01:52:40,422
关闭传送门前，要牵制住局势
Until we can close that portal, our priority is containment.

1788
01:52:40,555 --> 01:52:41,882
巴顿，你到屋顶
Barton, I want you on that roof.

1789
01:52:42,015 --> 01:52:43,888
盯住局势，有异常马上报告
Eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays.

1790
01:52:44,017 --> 01:52:45,391
史塔，你负责封锁区
Stark, you got the perimeter.

1791
01:52:45,518 --> 01:52:46,680
有跑出三个街区的
Anything gets more than three blocks out,

1792
01:52:46,811 --> 01:52:48,352
你就把它抓回来或者消灭掉
you turn it back or you turn it to ash.

1793
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:49,677
- 能带我一程吗？- 没问题
- Can you give me a lift? - Right.

1794
01:52:49,814 --> 01:52:50,892
抓紧，神射手
Better clench up, Legolas.

1795
01:52:54,486 --> 01:52:56,857
托尔，你负责阻塞传送门
Thor, you got to try and bottleneck that portal.

1796
01:52:56,988 --> 01:52:58,150
拖慢敌军的行速
Slow them down.

1797
01:52:58,281 --> 01:53:00,438
用雷电杀敌
You got the lightning. Light the bastards up.

1798
01:53:02,744 --> 01:53:04,367
你和我就留守地面
You and me, we stay here on the ground.

1799
01:53:04,496 --> 01:53:05,526
继续作战
We keep the fighting here.

1800
01:53:05,663 --> 01:53:06,658
至于浩克
And Hulk...

1801
01:53:06,781 --> 01:53:07,991


1802
01:53:09,375 --> 01:53:10,454
给我砸
Smash.

1803
01:53:21,546 --> 01:53:22,964


1804
01:53:31,848 --> 01:53:34,934


1805
01:53:47,113 --> 01:53:48,531


1806
01:53:59,542 --> 01:54:01,920


1807
01:54:04,055 --> 01:54:05,169
长官
Sir.

1808
01:54:06,223 --> 01:54:07,218
理事会在线
The Council is on.

1809
01:54:12,104 --> 01:54:15,353
史塔，有很多敌人尾随你
Stark, you got a lot of strays sniffing your tail.

1810
01:54:17,192 --> 01:54:19,231
我只是不想他们到街面上
I'm just trying to keep them off the streets.

1811
01:54:19,361 --> 01:54:21,602
可是存太多又不值钱
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

1812
01:54:21,739 --> 01:54:22,900
找个急转弯
So find a tight corner.

1813
01:54:23,031 --> 01:54:24,359
收到
I will roger that.

1814
01:54:47,090 --> 01:54:48,299
好，伙计
Oh, boy.

1815
01:54:55,522 --> 01:54:57,146
好主意
Nice call.

1816
01:54:57,274 --> 01:54:58,471
还有别的招吗？
What else you got?

1817
01:54:58,609 --> 01:55:01,395
托尔在第六街与敌人作战
Thor is taking on a squadron down on Sixth.

1818
01:55:01,528 --> 01:55:03,734
竟敢不邀请我
And he didn't invite me.

1819
01:55:08,736 --> 01:55:10,321


1820
01:55:11,281 --> 01:55:12,782


1821
01:55:21,416 --> 01:55:23,209


1822
01:55:30,216 --> 01:55:31,884


1823
01:55:43,237 --> 01:55:44,860
队长，赶紧关上传送门
Captain, none of this is going to mean a damn thing

1824
01:55:44,988 --> 01:55:46,232
敌人太多了
if we don't close that portal.

1825
01:55:46,365 --> 01:55:48,024
用上巨炮也于事无补
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

1826
01:55:48,158 --> 01:55:50,399
或许不是枪炮的问题
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

1827
01:55:52,329 --> 01:55:54,285
想上去，你得有顺风车
If you want to get up there, you're going to need a ride.

1828
01:55:55,374 --> 01:55:56,452
找到顺风车了
I got a ride.

1829
01:55:57,584 --> 01:55:58,615
需要点助力
I could use a boost, though.

1830
01:56:01,213 --> 01:56:02,208
真要？
Are you sure about this?

1831
01:56:02,673 --> 01:56:05,210
会很好玩
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1832
01:56:20,892 --> 01:56:22,143


1833
01:56:32,244 --> 01:56:34,117
转弯
Okay, turn, turn.

1834
01:56:34,246 --> 01:56:35,988
慢点
Less! Less!

1835
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:10,733


1836
01:57:19,784 --> 01:57:21,411


1837
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:41,556


1838
01:57:47,937 --> 01:57:49,897


1839
01:57:51,524 --> 01:57:53,359


1840
01:57:52,259 --> 01:57:54,158
（中央火车站四十二大街站）

1841
01:57:55,153 --> 01:57:56,821


1842
01:57:58,704 --> 01:58:01,657
队长，42街过麦迪逊大道处的银行
Captain, the bank on 42nd past Madison.

1843
01:58:01,791 --> 01:58:03,533
有大批市民被困
They've cornered a lot of civilians in there.

1844
01:58:03,668 --> 01:58:05,576
我马上过来
I'm on it.

1845
01:58:07,540 --> 01:58:09,000


1846
01:58:10,084 --> 01:58:11,085


1847
01:58:16,174 --> 01:58:17,175


1848
01:58:23,055 --> 01:58:23,806


1849
01:58:25,690 --> 01:58:27,480
大家，快离开
Everyone! Clear out!

1850
01:58:27,477 --> 01:58:28,936


1851
01:58:32,523 --> 01:58:33,524


1852
01:58:57,388 --> 01:58:59,047
霍利局长
Director Fury,

1853
01:58:59,182 --> 01:59:00,972
理事会已作出决定
the Council has made a decision.

1854
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:03,851
知道了
I recognise the Council has made a decision.

1855
01:59:03,978 --> 01:59:05,555
肯定是个白痴决定
But given that it's a stupid-ass decision,

1856
01:59:05,688 --> 01:59:07,098
所以我选择无视
I have elected to ignore it.

1857
01:59:07,231 --> 01:59:10,564
局长，你最靠近战场
Director, you're closer than any of our subs.

1858
01:59:10,693 --> 01:59:11,688
你爬上飞机…
You scramble that jet...

1859
01:59:11,819 --> 01:59:14,523
那可是曼哈顿岛，议员们
That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman.

1860
01:59:14,655 --> 01:59:16,730
除非我的队伍阻挡不了
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

1861
01:59:16,866 --> 01:59:18,822
否则我不会下令发动核武攻击
I will not order a nuclear strike

1862
01:59:18,993 --> 01:59:20,403
来对付市民
against a civilian population.

1863
01:59:20,536 --> 01:59:22,943
如果真的制止不了，那就完蛋了
If we don't hold them here, we lose everything.

1864
01:59:23,081 --> 01:59:25,831
发动核武攻击才是真的完蛋
If I send that bird out, we already have.

1865
01:59:29,587 --> 01:59:31,294
是你
Oh, you.

1866
01:59:33,548 --> 01:59:34,710
鹰眼
Hawkeye!

1867
01:59:36,176 --> 01:59:37,171
娜塔莎，你干什么？
Nat, what are you doing?

1868
01:59:38,095 --> 01:59:39,089
帮下忙？
A little help?

1869
01:59:44,393 --> 01:59:45,387
没问题
I got him.

1870
01:59:56,274 --> 01:59:57,400


1871
02:00:00,778 --> 02:00:02,238


1872
02:00:05,283 --> 02:00:06,450


1873
02:00:07,910 --> 02:00:08,744


1874
02:00:11,962 --> 02:00:12,957
够了
Enough!

1875
02:00:13,296 --> 02:00:15,751
你们只不过是低等生物
You are, all of you, beneath me!

1876
02:00:15,882 --> 02:00:18,633
我是神明，愚蠢的生物
I am a god, you dull creature.

1877
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:20,253
我绝不妥协…
And I will not be bullied by...

1878
02:00:30,105 --> 02:00:31,978
弱神一个
Puny god.

1879
02:00:32,810 --> 02:00:34,604


1880
02:00:40,115 --> 02:00:41,573
权杖
The sceptre...

1881
02:00:42,743 --> 02:00:43,940
博士
Doctor.

1882
02:00:45,829 --> 02:00:48,663
洛基的权杖所拥有的力量
Loki's sceptre. The energy.

1883
02:00:48,790 --> 02:00:50,449
可以对付立方
The Tesseract can't fight,

1884
02:00:50,584 --> 02:00:52,622
因为彼此的力量是同类
but you can't protect against yourself.

1885
02:00:52,753 --> 02:00:53,747
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

1886
02:00:53,879 --> 02:00:55,123
你当时不知道自己在做什么
You didn't know what you were doing.

1887
02:00:58,175 --> 02:01:00,332
其实我是知道的
Actually, I think I did.

1888
02:01:00,469 --> 02:01:03,422
我设立了安全罩，以便切断能量源
I built in a safety to cut their power source.

1889
02:01:04,639 --> 02:01:06,049
洛基的权杖
Loki's sceptre.

1890
02:01:06,183 --> 02:01:08,755
应该可以关闭传送门
It may be able to close the portal.

1891
02:01:10,854 --> 02:01:13,011
它就近在眼前
And I'm looking right at it.

1892
02:01:14,018 --> 02:01:15,686


1893
02:01:24,993 --> 02:01:28,860
先生，我们的能量会在穿透护甲前用尽
Sir, we will lose power before we penetrate that shell.

1894
02:01:35,504 --> 02:01:38,788
佐维斯，听过约拿的故事吗？
Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

1895
02:01:38,924 --> 02:01:41,295
约拿可不是好榜样
I wouldn't consider him a role model.

1896
02:01:43,923 --> 02:01:45,049


1897
02:01:51,222 --> 02:01:52,390


1898
02:02:24,130 --> 02:02:25,506


1899
02:02:29,677 --> 02:02:32,555


1900
02:02:42,273 --> 02:02:43,941


1901
02:02:48,029 --> 02:02:50,114


1902
02:02:50,911 --> 02:02:52,702
霍利局长不再有话事权
Director Fury is no longer in command.

1903
02:02:52,830 --> 02:02:54,868
优先执行7A11
Override order 7-Alpha-1-1.

1904
02:02:54,999 --> 02:02:57,571
7A11,已确认，准备起飞
7-Alpha-1-1, confirmed. We're go for takeoff.

1905
02:02:58,461 --> 02:03:00,536
有飞机起飞
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

1906
02:03:01,047 --> 02:03:03,038
甲板上的人注意，有飞机擅自起飞
Anyone on the deck, we have a rogue bird.

1907
02:03:03,174 --> 02:03:04,453
拦截下来
We need to shut it down!

1908
02:03:04,592 --> 02:03:06,797
重复，行动未经许可
Repeat, takeoff is not authorised.

1909
02:03:37,333 --> 02:03:39,490
史塔，听到吗？
Stark, do you hear me?

1910
02:03:39,627 --> 02:03:41,749
有导弹直奔市中心
You have a missile headed straight for the city.

1911
02:03:42,296 --> 02:03:43,670
还有多久？
How long?

1912
02:03:43,798 --> 02:03:45,873
最多三分钟
Three minutes, max.

1913
02:03:46,008 --> 02:03:47,632
导弹会夷平市中心
The payload will wipe out Midtown.

1914
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:49,798
佐维斯，将所有能量注入推进器
Jarvis, put everything we got into the thrusters.

1915
02:03:49,929 --> 02:03:51,588
完成了
I just did.

1916
02:04:04,485 --> 02:04:05,812
发射完毕
Package is sent.

1917
02:04:05,945 --> 02:04:09,064
两分三十秒后会爆炸
Detonation in 2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.

1918
02:04:17,868 --> 02:04:18,911


1919
02:04:26,794 --> 02:04:27,795


1920
02:04:31,846 --> 02:04:34,217
有能力再战一回吗？
Are you ready for another bout?

1921
02:04:34,890 --> 02:04:35,921
怎么，你累了？
What, are you getting sleepy?

1922
02:04:41,522 --> 02:04:43,264
对准上端
Right at the crown!

1923
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,070
我能关掉传送门
I can close it.

1924
02:04:51,198 --> 02:04:53,237
有人听到吗
Can anybody copy?

1925
02:04:53,367 --> 02:04:54,481
我能关掉传送门
I can shut the portal down.

1926
02:04:54,618 --> 02:04:56,657
- 赶快 - 等下
- Do it! - No, wait.

1927
02:04:56,786 --> 02:04:58,030
史塔，敌军不断攻入
Stark, these things are still coming.

1928
02:04:58,163 --> 02:04:59,157
有颗导弹正奔过来
I got a nuke coming in.

1929
02:04:59,289 --> 02:05:01,197
会在一分钟内爆炸
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

1930
02:05:10,884 --> 02:05:12,710
我找到绝佳的爆炸场所
And I know just where to put it.

1931
02:05:19,893 --> 02:05:22,264
史塔，你有去无回
Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.

1932
02:05:22,395 --> 02:05:23,770
剩下的能量用来上升，佐维斯
Save the rest for the turn, J.

1933
02:05:23,897 --> 02:05:27,976
先生，要不要致电宝芝小姐？
Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?

1934
02:05:28,109 --> 02:05:30,148
也好
Might as well.

1935
02:05:32,072 --> 02:05:34,443
纽约市的街道变成了战场
The streets of New York City have become a battleground.

1936
02:05:34,574 --> 02:05:37,278
军方试图牵制敌方
The Army is here trying to contain the violence

1937
02:05:37,410 --> 02:05:38,868
不过实力悬殊
- but clearly, it is outmatched.

1938
02:05:38,995 --> 02:05:41,283
不得不说，鄙人多年新闻报道中
And I have to say, in all my years of reporting,

1939
02:05:41,414 --> 02:05:44,331
亦未曾见过如斯情形
I have never seen anything like this.

1940
02:05:44,459 --> 02:05:45,952
我方战斗小组的资料有限
We have limited information on the team

1941
02:05:46,086 --> 02:05:49,833
不过据知有亿万富翁史塔的钢铁侠
but we do know that billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...

1942
02:05:58,719 --> 02:06:00,054


1943
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:13,317


1944
02:06:26,576 --> 02:06:28,155
（呼叫小辣椒失败）
(JARVIS POWERING DOWN)

1945
02:06:47,309 --> 02:06:48,352


1946
02:07:03,163 --> 02:07:04,988
快呀，史塔
Come on, Stark.

1947
02:07:06,036 --> 02:07:07,663


1948
02:07:11,629 --> 02:07:12,743
关掉
Close it.

1949
02:07:32,817 --> 02:07:33,812
臭小子
Son of a gun.

1950
02:07:38,572 --> 02:07:40,196
他没有减速
He's not slowing down.

1951
02:07:58,258 --> 02:07:59,716
还有呼吸吗？
Is he breathing?

1952
02:08:21,278 --> 02:08:22,780


1953
02:08:25,616 --> 02:08:26,742


1954
02:08:27,579 --> 02:08:28,989
怎么了？
What the hell?

1955
02:08:31,709 --> 02:08:33,830
干嘛？
What just happened?

1956
02:08:33,961 --> 02:08:36,249
不要告诉我，没人给我做人工呼吸
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

1957
02:08:40,551 --> 02:08:42,210
我们打赢了
We won.

1958
02:08:42,841 --> 02:08:43,842


1959
02:08:44,555 --> 02:08:45,834
太好了
All right, yay!

1960
02:08:45,973 --> 02:08:47,929
干得好
Hurray. Good job, guys.

1961
02:08:48,058 --> 02:08:51,260
明天不上班，休假一天吧
Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day.

1962
02:08:52,146 --> 02:08:53,722
吃过土耳其烤肉吗?
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1963
02:08:54,148 --> 02:08:56,435
离这里两个街口有档土耳其烤肉
There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here.

1964
02:08:56,567 --> 02:08:58,226
虽然不清楚，但是我想试试
I don't know what it is, but I want to try it.

1965
02:08:58,652 --> 02:09:00,110
事情还没结束
We're not finished yet.

1966
02:09:05,075 --> 02:09:07,197
那就稍后再吃烤肉
And then shawarma after.

1967
02:09:11,912 --> 02:09:13,831


1968
02:09:28,849 --> 02:09:31,090
如果你们不介意
If it's all the same to you,

1969
02:09:34,396 --> 02:09:36,055
我想喝杯酒
I'll have that drink now.

1970
02:09:43,947 --> 02:09:47,823
此次灾难事件已确认为外星人袭击事件
Despite the devastation of what has been confirmed as an extraterrestrial attack,

1971
02:09:47,951 --> 02:09:49,493
一班天赋异禀人士
the extraordinary heroics

1972
02:09:49,620 --> 02:09:51,576
组成的复仇者联盟团队
of the group known as the Avengers

1973
02:09:51,705 --> 02:09:53,246
不但慰藉民心
has been to many a cause not only for comfort,

1974
02:09:53,374 --> 02:09:54,368
更被津津乐道
but for celebration.

1975
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:58,834
有这样的人士守护我们，太好了
It's just really great knowing they're out there.That someone is watching over us.

1976
02:09:58,962 --> 02:10:00,159
我爱你，雷神托尔
I love you, Thor!

1977
02:10:00,297 --> 02:10:02,004
然后这些家伙…
And then these guys were like...

1978
02:10:02,132 --> 02:10:03,460
然后天空变得…
And then the air goes...

1979
02:10:03,592 --> 02:10:04,966
接着绿巨人走过来…
And this green guy walks up and he goes...

1980
02:10:05,094 --> 02:10:06,124
不知道
I don't know.

1981
02:10:06,261 --> 02:10:08,716
我并不觉得安全
I don't exactly feel safer with those things out there.

1982
02:10:08,847 --> 02:10:11,931
政府似乎有所隐瞒
It just seems that there's a lot they're not telling us.

1983
02:10:12,059 --> 02:10:15,474
超级英雄在纽约？别闹了
Superheroes in New York? Give me a break.

1984
02:10:15,604 --> 02:10:17,512
这般所谓的英雄
These so-called "heroes"

1985
02:10:17,648 --> 02:10:21,223
要对这所城市遭受的破坏负责
have to be held responsible for the destruction done to this city.

1986
02:10:21,359 --> 02:10:23,481
这是他们造成的，他们去哪了？
This was their fight. Where are they now?

1987
02:10:24,112 --> 02:10:26,436
尽管大家对这些英雄疑问多多
Tough questions are being asked about the Avengers themselves.

1988
02:10:26,572 --> 02:10:27,567
他们从天而降
Their sudden appearance

1989
02:10:27,698 --> 02:10:29,073
又突然消失
and equally sudden disappearance...

1990
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:31,986
这也归咎于他们吗？
What, this is all somehow their fault?

1991
02:10:34,038 --> 02:10:37,204
美国队长救了我
Captain America saved my life.

1992
02:10:39,335 --> 02:10:42,833
无论他在哪里，无论他们在哪
Wherever he is, and wherever any of them are,

1993
02:10:42,964 --> 02:10:44,457
我只想…
I would just...

1994
02:10:45,258 --> 02:10:47,545
我只想道声谢
I would want to say thank you.

1995
02:10:50,012 --> 02:10:51,506
复仇者们去哪了？
Where are the Avengers?

1996
02:10:51,639 --> 02:10:54,046
我目前没追查他们的行踪
I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts.

1997
02:10:54,183 --> 02:10:56,341
但他们应该休息下
I'd say they've earned a leave of absence.

1998
02:10:56,477 --> 02:10:58,054
至于宇宙立方？
And the Tesseract?

1999
02:10:58,187 --> 02:11:00,428
立方回去了属于它的地方
The Tesseract is where it belongs.

2000
02:11:00,857 --> 02:11:03,181
一个我们去不到的地方
Out of our reach.

2001
02:11:03,317 --> 02:11:04,859
你无权话事
That's not your call.

2002
02:11:04,986 --> 02:11:06,016
我可没做什么
I didn't make it.

2003
02:11:06,154 --> 02:11:08,394
我只是遵循神的旨意
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

2004
02:11:08,531 --> 02:11:10,321
可你让他带走
So, you let him take it

2005
02:11:10,450 --> 02:11:12,073
至于战犯洛基
and the war criminal, Loki,

2006
02:11:12,201 --> 02:11:13,908
他应该为所犯下的负责
who should be answering for his crime.

2007
02:11:14,036 --> 02:11:16,609
他会的
Oh, I think he will be.

2008
02:11:30,094 --> 02:11:32,763
你根本不知道你在做什么
I don't think you understand what you've started,

2009
02:11:32,889 --> 02:11:35,343
对复仇者们放任不管
letting the Avengers loose on this world.

2010
02:11:35,892 --> 02:11:36,886
他们很危险的
They're dangerous.

2011
02:11:37,018 --> 02:11:40,682
全世界都知道
They surely are, and the whole world knows it.

2012
02:11:41,230 --> 02:11:43,803
全宇宙都知道
Every world knows it.

2013
02:11:44,233 --> 02:11:46,308
这就是你的目的？
Was that the point of all this?

2014
02:11:46,444 --> 02:11:48,186
声明？
A statement?

2015
02:11:50,907 --> 02:11:52,364
保证？
A promise.

2016
02:12:01,084 --> 02:12:02,625
长官，下一步怎么做？
Sir, how does it work now?

2017
02:12:03,753 --> 02:12:05,744
他们各奔天涯了
They've gone their separate ways.

2018
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:08,797
有些还跑得相当远
Some, pretty extremely far.

2019
02:12:09,550 --> 02:12:11,459
如果再发生类似事件
If we get into a situation like this again,

2020
02:12:11,594 --> 02:12:13,135
要怎么办
what happens then?

2021
02:12:13,262 --> 02:12:14,257
他们会回来的
They'll come back.

2022
02:12:15,765 --> 02:12:17,472
你肯定？
Are you really sure about that?

2023
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:18,595
没错
I am.

2024
02:12:20,228 --> 02:12:21,425
何以见得？
Why?

2025
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:24,685
因为我们需要他们回来
Because we'll need them to.

2026
02:12:40,621 --> 02:12:42,372


2027
02:15:16,278 --> 02:15:18,768
人类
Humans.

2028
02:15:20,073 --> 02:15:24,402
并非我们想象中那么弱小
They are not the cowering wretches we were promised.

2029
02:15:25,370 --> 02:15:27,528
他们意志坚定
They stand.

2030
02:15:28,373 --> 02:15:34,825
桀骜不驯，因而难以奴役
They are unruly, and therefore cannot be ruled.

2031
02:15:41,803 --> 02:15:44,673
挑衅人类
To challenge them

2032
02:15:44,805 --> 02:15:48,505
等同自寻死路
is to court death.

2033
