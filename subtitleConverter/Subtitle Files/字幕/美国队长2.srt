好吧  这次怪我
Okay. That one's on me.

You just can't stop yourself from lying, can you?

172
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,110
我没撒谎  罗曼诺夫特工的任务和你不同

306
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,470
我怎么能离开我的美人
Well, I couldn't leave my best girl.

307
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,070
她还欠我一支舞呢
Not when she owes me a dance.

308
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,610
封闭办公室

316
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,050
尼古拉斯·J·弗瑞
Fury, Nicholas J.

317
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,300
世界安全理事会
World Security Council.

318

确认
Confirmed.

319
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,610
如果尼克·弗瑞觉得派他的扮装男
If Nick Fury thinks he can get us costumed thugs

320
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,780
和突击队处理好他惹的麻烦就行了
and S.T.R.I.K.E commandos to mop-up his mess,

321
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,410
那他是大错特错  此次失利不能容忍
he's sadly mistaken. This failure is unacceptable.

322
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,630
鉴于袭击就发生在
Well, considering this attack took place one mile

323
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,220
我国海域一英里外
from my country's sovereign waters,

324
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,950
恐怕这样还不够  我提议立刻开听证会
it's a bit more then that. I move for immediate hearing.

325
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,710
我们不需要听证会  需要行动
We don't need hearings, we need action.

326
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,390
理事会的责任就是监管神盾局
It's this Council's duty to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D.

327
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,480
这样的失守引出了许多疑问
A breach like this raises serious questions.

328
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,260
比如一个法国海盗
Like how the hell did a French pirate

329
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:37,350
是怎么在光天化日下劫持了神盾局的机密军舰
manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D vessel in broad daylight?

330
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,530
申明一下  理事
For the record, councilman,

331
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,600
他是阿尔及利亚人
he's Algerian.

332
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,510
需要的话我可以画张地图
I can draw a map if it'll help.

333
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,040
多谢你的指教  皮尔斯部长
I appreciate your wits, Secretary Pierce.

334
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,880
但是本理事会
But this council take things

335
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,240
对国际海盗问题的态度很严肃
like international piracy fairly seriously.

336
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,320
是吗
Really?

337
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,760
我倒不在乎
I don't.

338
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,080
我不在乎一船一舰
I don't care about one boat,

339
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,160
我在乎整个舰队
I care about the fleet.

340
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,730
如果理事会遇到点小事
If this council is going to fold a rancor every time

341
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,010
就要大肆抱怨一番
someone pushes us on the playing field,

342
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,010
那或许也该找人监管我们了
maybe we need someone to oversee us.

343
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,560
部长先生  我们不是说...
Mr. Secretary, nobody is suggesting...

344
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,930
失陪一下
Excuse me.

345
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,610
又有麻烦了吗  部长先生
More trouble, Mr. Secretary?

346
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,270
那要看你怎么定义麻烦
It depends on your definition.

347
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,830
我们办公室只隔了四十层
I work forty floors away

348
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,550
没人劫船你都不肯来吗
and it takes a hijacking for you to visit?

349
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,480
核战爆发我也会来的
Well, a nuclear war would do it too.

350
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
忙吗
Busy in there?

351
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,250
用钱都能解决
Nothing some earmarks can't fix.

352
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,420
我是来找你帮忙的
I'm here to ask a favor.

353
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,830
我希望你能组织一次投票
I want you to call for a vote.

354
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,110
洞察计划需要延后
Project Insight has to be delayed.

355
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,940
尼克  这不是小忙
Nick, that's not a favor,

356
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,580
这需要小组委员会开慢长的听证会
that's a subcommittee hearing. A long one.

357
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,690
或许也没什么问题
It could be nothing, probably is nothing.

358
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:55,430
可我得确保万无一失
I just need time to make sure it's nothing.

359
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,420
如果有问题呢
What if it's something?

360
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,720
那我们都该庆幸
Then we'll both be damn glad

361
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,490
没把天空航母送上天
those Helicarriers aren't in the air.

362
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,720
好吧
Fine.

363
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,570
但你得让钢铁侠参加我侄女的生日派对
But you gotta get Iron Man to stop by my niece's birthday party.

364
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,120
谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

365
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,330
路过不算数  得好好玩会儿
And not just a fly-by, he's got to mingle.

366
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,400
问题是  我觉得情况在恶化
The thing is I think it's getting worse.

367
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,380
上周一个警察叫停了我的车
A cop pulled me over last week,

368
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,790
他以为我喝醉了
he thought I was drunk.

369
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,720
我急转弯  想躲一个塑料袋
I swerved to miss a plastic bag.

371

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,060
有些东西被带了回来

373
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,370
想好要怎么承担是我们的事
It's our job to figure out how to carry it.

374
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,470
是装在箱子里
Is it gonna be in a big suitcase

375
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,770
还是放在钱包里
or in a little man-purse?

376
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,020
取决于你自己
It's up to you.

377
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,060
下周见
I'll see you next week.

378
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,100
这不是跑步小能手吗

00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,550

383
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,560

我纠结了好一阵寻找一个留在那的理由

393
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,130
但回归正常生活还是开心的吧
But you're happy now, back in the world?

394
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,260
现在对我发号施令的人

395
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,300
已经...没有了

你要是  不介意的话
Hey, if you want... if you want,

458
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,340
可以用我的洗衣机
you're welcome to use my machine.

459
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,650
应该比地下室那个便宜
Might be cheaper than the one in the basement.

460
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,990
是吗  有多便宜
Oh, yeah? What's it cost?

461
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,500

还是别用你的洗衣机洗我的白大褂了
you really don't want my scrubs in your machine.

465
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,760
我刚换班

是吗  谢谢
Oh. Right, thank you.

471
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,870
我好像没给过你钥匙
I don't remember giving you a key.

472
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,770
你觉得我需要吗
You really think I'd need one?

473
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,950
我老婆把我赶出来了
My wife kicked me out.

474
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,370
我都不知道你结婚了
Didn't know you were married.

475
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,090
你不知道我的事多了
There are a lot of things you don't about me.

476
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,750
这我知道  尼克  问题就在这
I know, Nick. That's the problem.

477
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,160

00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,120
很抱歉我这样不请自来
I'm sorry to have do this,

479
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,840
但我真无处可去了
but I had no place else to crash.

480
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,840
{\an8}神盾局有问题

481
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,380
还有谁知道你老婆的事
Who else knows about your wife?

482
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,220
{\an8}你和我

483

00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,360
我们算朋友吗
Is that what we are?

486
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,650
那取决于你了
That's up to you.

487
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:34,110
不要相信任何人

告诉他们我去追了
Tell them I'm in pursuit.

498

526
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,440
娜塔莎

娜塔莎
Natasha!

528
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:42,220
弗瑞怎么会去你家
Why was Fury in your apartment?

529
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,000
我也不知道
I don't know.

530
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,260
队长  他们叫你回神盾局
Captain, they want you back at S.H.I.E.L.D.

531
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,410

Yeah, give me a second.

532
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,370
他们让你立刻回去
They want you now.

533
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,130
知道了
Okay.

534
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,530
你真不会说谎
You're a terrible liar.

535
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,470
突击队立刻护送罗杰斯队长
S.T.R.I.K.E team escort Captain Rogers

536
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,350
返回神盾局
back to S.H.I.E.L.D immediately.

537
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:08,850
我跟他说了
I told him.

538
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,120
我们走
Let's go.

539
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,840
好
Yeah.

540
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,810
突击队  出发
S.T.R.I.K.E, move it out.

541
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,950
无论结果如何  你尽力了
For whatever it's worth, you did your best.

542
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,250
谢谢您  长官
Thank you, sir.

543
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,020
罗杰斯队长
Captain Rogers.

544
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,820
邻居
Neighbor.

545
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,900
队长  我是亚历山大·皮尔斯
Ah, Captain. I'm Alexander Pierce.

546
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,600
长官  很荣幸见到你
Sir, it's an honor.

547
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,780
感到荣幸的应该是我  队长
The honor is mine, Captain.

548
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,300
我父亲是101空降师的  进来吧
My father served in the 101st. Come on in.

549
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,260
那张照片是我和尼克认识五年后拍的
That photo was taken five years after Nick and I met,

550
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,200
那时我在哥伦比亚国务院
when I was at State Department in Bogota.

551
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,480
哥伦比亚民族解放军占领使馆后
ELN rebels took the embassy,

552
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,430
警卫帮我逃了出来
and security got me out,

553
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,950
但是叛军抓走了人质
but the rebels took hostages.

554
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:07,460
尼克是神盾局当地站点的二把手
Nick was deputy chief for the S.H.I.E.L.D station there.

555
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,970
他提出了一个计划
And he comes to me with a plan.

556
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,250
要通过下水道进行突袭
He wants to storm the building through the sewers.

557
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,900
我说  不行  我们会谈判的
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

558
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,760
结果是  叛军不跟我们谈判
Turned out the ELN didn't negotiate,

559
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,400
于是下令格杀勿论
so they put out a kill order.

560
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,140
他们冲进了地下室
They stormed the basement,

561
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,390
结果发现了什么呢  那里空了
and what did they find? They find it empty.

562
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,450
尼克违抗了我的直接命令
Nick had ignored my direct order

563
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:29,310
在外国境内  擅自采取了军事行动
and carried out an unauthorized military operation on foreign soil.

564
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,310
营救了十几名政府官员
He saved the lives of a dozen political officers,

565
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,560
还有我的女儿
including my daughter.

566
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,890
所以你提拔了他
So you gave him a promotion.

567
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,070
而且从未后悔过
I've never had any cause to regret it.

568
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,390
队长  尼克昨晚为什么去你家
Captain, why was Nick in your apartment last night?

569
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,110
我不知道
I don't know.

570
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:48,730
你知道那里被监听了吗
You know it was bugged?

571
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,840
知道  还是尼克告诉我的
I did, because Nick told me.

572
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,530
那他告诉你是他监听的了吗
Did he tell you he was the one who bugged it?

573
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,010
我给你看样东西
I want you to see something.

574
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,210
巴托克  是谁雇了你
Who hired you, Batroc?

575
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:06,770
这是直播吗
Is that live?

576
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,000
是的  他们昨晚在阿尔及尔
Yeah, they picked him up last night

577
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,740
一个不够安全的安全屋抓到了他
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

578
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,780
你是说他是嫌犯
Are you saying he's a suspect?

579
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,770
巴托克可不做暗杀
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

580
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:16,960
不是他  事情要更复杂些
No, it's more complicated than that.

581
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,630
巴托克受匿名人士雇佣
Batroc was hired anonymously

582
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,400
袭击雷姆利亚星号
to attack the Lemurian Star

583
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:21,910
他们通过电子邮件联系
and he was contacted by e-mail

584
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,780
用电汇付款
and paid by wire transfer.

585
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,660
之后这笔钱经过了
And then the money was run through

586
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,980
17个虚假账户转账
seventeen fictitious accounts,

587
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,850
最后转给一家控股公司
the last one going to a holding company

588
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:33,270
公司注册者叫雅各布·维奇
that was registered to a Jacob Veech.

589
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:34,910
我应该认识他吗
Am I supposed to know who that is?

590
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,140
不应该  维奇六年前就死了
Not likely. Veech died six years ago.

591
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,240
他最后的地址是
His last address was

592
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,610
埃尔姆赫斯特大街1435号
14-35 Elmhurst Drive.

593
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,990
我第一次见尼克时
When I first met Nick

594
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,990
他母亲住在1437号
his mother lived at 14-37.

595
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,180
你的意思是弗瑞雇了海盗吗
Are you saying Fury hired the pirates?

596
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:49,440
为什么呢
Why?

597
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,000
大部分人的看法
Well the prevailing theory

598
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,280
是劫持事件只是在掩盖
was that the hijacking was a cover

599
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,440
机密情报的交易
for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence.

600
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,440
交易出了岔  结果尼克送了命
The sale went sour and that led to Nick's death.

601
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:06,900
如果你真了解尼克·弗瑞
If you really knew Nick Fury

602
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,120
就该知道这不可能
you know that's not true.

603
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:10,970
不然我为什么找你来
Why do you think we're talking?

604
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,700
你知道吗  我在理事会工作
See, I took a seat on the Council

605
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,590
不是我愿意  而是应尼克的请求
not because I wanted to but because Nick asked me to,

606
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,760
因为我们都十分现实
because we were both realists.

607
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:25,590
我们知道  除去那些
We knew that despite all the diplomacy

608
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,460
外交手腕和官样文章
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

609
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,540
想建立更美好的新世界
that to build a really better world

610
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,090
有时需要摧毁旧世界
sometimes means having to tear the old one down.

611
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,310
而这样难免树敌
And that makes enemies.

612
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,500
他们会说你无耻肮脏
Those people that call you dirty

613
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,070
因为你能狠下心做见不得人的事
because you got the guts to stick your hands in the mud

614
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,410
好创造更美好的事物
and try to build something better.

615
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:50,500
一想到那些人今天会拍手称快
And the idea that those people could be happy today,

616
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:54,340
就让我非常恼火
makes me really, really angry.

617
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,940
队长  你是尼克生前见到的最后一人
Captain, you were the last one to see Nick alive.

618
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,300
我认为这绝非巧合
I don't think that's an accident,

619
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,040
我想你也这样觉得
and I don't think you do either.

620
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,810
所以我再问你一次
So I'm gonna ask again,

621
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:10,690
他为什么会去你那
why was he there?

622
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,830
他告诉我不要相信任何人
He told me not to trust anyone.

623
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,760
也包括他吗
I wonder if that included him.

624
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,630
抱歉  那是他的遗言
I'm sorry. Those were his last words.

625
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,120
失陪
Excuse me.

626
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,570
队长
Captain.

627
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,160
有人杀害了我的朋友  我必须查明原委
Somebody murdered my friend and I'm gonna find out why.

628
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:43,040
挡我路的  我都会让他后悔
Anyone gets in my way, they're gonna regret it.

629
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:45,090
无论是谁

639
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,210
想让我们去看看
they want us to see.

640
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:33,870
要让战术小队就绪吗
You want me to get the tac-team ready?

641
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:36,210
先看看情况再说
No, lets wait and see what it is first.

642
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,330
好的
Right.

643
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:50,340

动手之前

657
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:48,230
我就想说  队长  这不是针对你
I just want you to know, Cap, this ain't personal.

658
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,050
感觉就是针对我
It kind of feels personal.

659
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,300
放下盾牌  举起双手
Drop the shield! Put your hands in the air!

660
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,090
投降吧  罗杰斯

661
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:30,550
把门打开
Get that door open!

662
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:32,650
你无路可逃了
You have nowhere to go!

663
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,460
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

664
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,080
他往车库去了  封闭大桥
He's headed for the garage. Lock down the bridge!

665
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:10,630
罗杰斯队长  立刻投降
Stand down, Captain Rogers. Stand down.

666
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:13,140
重复  立刻投降
Repeat, stand down.

667
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,370
都听好了

668

无论手头上有什么事  都推掉

669
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,820
现在是一级戒备
This is level one.

670
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,900
通知交通部  特区的路口全部亮红灯
Contact DOT. All traffic lights in the district go red.

671
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:03,120
封锁附近机场所有跑道

恕我直言
With all due respect,

678
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,560
如果神盾局要追捕美国队长
If S.H.I.E.L.D is conducting a manhunt for Captain America,

679
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,880
我们有权知道原因
we deserve to know why.

680
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,580
因为他骗了我们
Because he lied to us.

681
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:27,860
罗杰斯队长知道弗瑞局长之死的内情
Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury,

682
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,310
却不愿告诉我们
he refused to share it.

683
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:33,080
我知道大家很难接受
As difficult as this is to accept,

684
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,710
但美国队长现在是神盾局的逃犯
Captain America is a fugitive from S.H.I.E.L.D.

685
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:05,740
-哪去了  -安全的地方
- Where is it? - Safe.

686
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:06,480
具体点
Do better!

687
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,510
你哪里弄来的
Where did you get it?

688
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,780
凭什么告诉你
Why would I tell you?

689
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:10,990
弗瑞为什么要给你
Fury gave it to you. Why?

690
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:12,010
里面是什么
What's on it?

691
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:12,680
我不知道
I don't know.

692
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,780
别说谎
Stop lying!

693
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:16,430
我只是摆出什么都知道的样子  罗杰斯
I only act like I know everything, Rogers.

694
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,210
你一定知道是弗瑞雇了海盗
I bet you knew Fury hired the pirates, didn't you?

695
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:20,600
那倒是说得通
Well, it makes sense.

696
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,040
那艘船有问题  你和弗瑞都得想办法上去
The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.

697
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,790
别让我再问你第二遍
I'm not gonna ask you again.

698
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,710
我知道是谁杀了弗瑞
I know who killed Fury.

699
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,870
多数情报机构不相信他的存在
Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists,

700
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:36,720
相信的称他为冬日战士
the ones who do call him the Winter Soldier.

701
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:39,130
在过去的五十年里  他参与了二十多起
He's credited with over two dozen assassinations

702
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:41,420
暗杀事件
in the last fifty years.

703
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,040
那他是个鬼故事咯
So he's a ghost story.

704
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,650
五年前  我护送一个核武器工程师离开伊朗
Five years ago I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran,

705
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,200
快到敖德萨时  有人射穿了我的轮胎
somebody shot at my tires near Odessa.

706
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,030
车失控掉下悬崖  我们逃了出来
We lost control, went straight over a cliff, I pulled us out,

707
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,180
但冬日战士也在那里
but the Winter Soldier was there.

708
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,950
见我挡着  他就一枪打穿了我  杀了工程师
I was covering my engineer, so he shot him straight through me.

709
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:05,560
前苏联子弹  没有膛线  穿不了比基尼了
A Soviet slag, no rifling. Bye-bye bikinis.

710
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,380
你现在穿比基尼一定很丑
Yeah, I bet you look terrible in them now.

711
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:13,730
追踪他是没用的  我试过
Going after him is a dead end. I know, I've tried.

712
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,690
像你说的  他就是个鬼故事
Like you said, he's a ghost story.

713
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,440
那就看看这个鬼到底想要什么
Well, let's find out what the ghost wants.

714
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,150
尼克·弗瑞被残忍地谋杀了
Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood.

715
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,810
但凡是个正常人
To any reasonable person,

716
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:30,610
都会说他是烈士  而非叛徒
that would make him a martyr, not a traitor.

717
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:32,190
知道他怎么是叛徒了吗
You know what makes him a traitor?

718
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:34,870
他让雇佣兵劫持自己的船
Hiring a mercenary to hijack his own ship.

719
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:37,120
尼克·弗瑞利用与你的交情
Nick Fury used your friendship

720
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,240
强迫理事会延迟洞察计划
to coerce this council into delaying Project Insight.

721
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,050
他知道这个计划会暴露他的非法行动
A project he knew would expose his own illegal operations.

722
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:44,830
说好听点  他骗了你
At best, he lied to you.

723
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:48,170
-说句不好听的  -你们是让我引咎辞职吗
- At worst... - Are you calling for my resignation?

724
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,920
我现在就可以写辞呈
I've got a pen and paper right here.

725
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,890
这个我们可以迟点讨论
That discussion can be tabled for a later time.

726
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:55,580
你们还真想让我辞职
But you do want to have a discussion.

727
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,840
我们已经谈过了  部长先生
We've already had it, Mr. Secretary.

728
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:03,290
理事会决定立即重启洞察计划
This council moves to immediately reactivate Project Insight.

729
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:07,940
你要是想耍嘴皮子  赶紧趁现在
If you want to say something snappy, now would be a good time.

730
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:17,230
逃亡第一准则  只能走不能跑
First rule of going on the run is, don't run, walk.

731
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:20,360
如果穿着这双鞋跑  早就掉下来了
If I run in these shoes, they're gonna fall off.

732
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:24,870
这个U盘拥有六级定位系统
The drive has a level six homing program,

733
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:27,750
一旦启动  神盾局就能定位我们
so as soon as we boot up S.H.I.E.L.D will know exactly where we are.

734
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,040
我们有多长时间
How much time do we have?

735
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:32,210
九分钟吧  现在
About nine minutes from...

736
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:33,940
开始
Now.

737
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,170
弗瑞的猜测是对的
Fury was right about that ship,

738
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,110
有人想在那艘船上藏东西
somebody's trying to hide something.

739
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,300
{\an8}雷姆利亚星号

740
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:45,670
这个U盘被某种人工智能保护着
This drive is protected by some sort of AI,

741
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:48,250
一直在重新编程  抵抗我的指令
it keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands.

742
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,480
你能破解吗
Can you override it?

743
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:53,300
开发这个程序的人比我聪明点
The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me.

744
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,680
就那么一点
Slightly.

745
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,160
我要试试追踪程序
I'm gonna try running a tracer.

746
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:09,190
这是神盾局用来
This is a program that S.H.I.E.L.D

747
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:10,910
追踪恶意软件的程序
developed to track hostile malware,

748
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:14,020
就算我们读不到文件
so if we can't read the file,

749
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,170
也许可以查到它的来源
maybe we can find out where it came from.

750
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:17,790
有什么可以帮到你们的吗
Can I help you guys with anything?

751
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:18,700
没事
Oh, no.

752
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:21,680
我跟未婚夫正在选度蜜月的地方
My fiancé was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations.

753
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,760

你们准备去哪呢
Where do you guys thinking about going?

756
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,630
{\an8}新泽西州

757
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:28,870
新泽西州
New Jersey.

758
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:36,660
我也有这款眼镜
I have the exact same glasses.

759
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:38,800
你们还真像双胞胎
Wow, you two are practically twins.

760
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,790
我也希望有你的身材

你搭南边的扶梯去地铁站

好吧  我有个问题
Alright, I have a question for you,

791
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:18,670
你可以不回答
of which you do not have to answer.

792
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,210
不过我觉得如果你不回答
I feel like if you don't answer it though,

793
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:21,390
也算是回答了
you're kind of answering it, you know?

794
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,020
什么问题
What?

795
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,790
刚刚是你自1945年来  第一次接吻吗
Was that your first kiss since 1945?

796
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:25,870
有那么糟吗
That bad, huh?

797
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:26,610
我可没那么说
I didn't say that.

798
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,400
听起来就是那个意思
Well, it kind of sounds like that's what you're saying.

799
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,380
不是  我只是好奇你练习过几次
No, I didn't. I just wondered how much practice you had.

800
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:33,500
-我不需要练习  -每个人都需要
- I don't need practice. - Everybody needs practice.

801
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,000
那不是我自1945年来的第一次接吻
It was not my first kiss since 1945.

802
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:38,050
我是95岁了  可我不是死人

不管你信不信
Believe it or not,

805
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,630
要找个和我有类似人生经历的人不太容易
it's kind of hard to find someone with shared life experience.

806
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,540
管他的  你随便编个故事就好了
Well, that's alright, you just make something up.

807
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:48,780
像你一样吗
What, like you?

808
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:51,160
我不知道  说实话也要看情况
I don't know. The truth is a matter of circumstances,

809
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:54,000
不能对谁都掏心窝
it's not all things to all people all the time.

810
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:56,230
我也是
And neither am I.

811
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:58,160
这样活着很累
That's a tough way to live.

812
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,920
但能保命
It's a good way not to die, though.

813
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,510
不了解一个人的本质
You know, it's kind of hard to trust someone

814
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:05,700
你怎么信任他
when you don't know who that someone really is.

815
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,390
对
Yeah.

816
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:11,960

快点  归队
Come on! Fall in!

831
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,810
罗杰斯  我说归队
Rogers! I said fall in!

832
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:23,760
这里没戏
This is a dead end.

833
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,910
没热成像  没信号  连无线电波都没有
Zero heat signature, zero waves, not even radio.

834
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,050
编写文件的人
Whoever wrote the file

835
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:31,320
应该用了路由器来摆脱追踪

836
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,030
怎么了
What is it?

按照军规  营房五百码范围内
Army regulations forbid storing ammunition

838
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,290
禁止存放弹药
within five hundred yards from the barracks.

839
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:40,730
这栋建筑不该建在这
This building is in the wrong place.

840
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,520
这是神盾局的地方
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.

841

在这么隐秘的地方工作
If you already working in a secret office

847
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,380
为什么还要藏着电梯

我才不是录像  女士
I am not a recording, Fraulein.

859

阿尔宁·佐拉是红骷髅手下的德国科学家

科学拯救不了我的身体  但我的思想

870
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:37,900
值得留存

01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:41,840
于是存在了这20万单元的数据库中

我们赢了  队长
We won, Captain.

915
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:26,980
你的死亡与你的人生一样
Your death amounts to the same as your life;

916
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,400
{\an8}罗杰斯失踪

917
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,570
{\an8}牺牲了一切的英雄

918
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,900
毫无意义
a zero sum.

919
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:33,310
刚才我说到
As I was saying...

920
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,580
这U盘里是什么
What's on this drive?

921
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:37,320
洞察计划
Project Insight

922
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:41,950
需要洞察力  所以我编写了一个算法
requires insight. So I wrote an algorithm.

923
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:43,530
什么算法  有什么用
What kind of algorithm? What does it do?

924
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:46,600
你问题的答案十分有趣
The answer to your question is fascinating.

925
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:51,430
可惜  你们要死了  听不到了
Unfortunately, you shall be too dead to hear it.

926
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:58,250
史蒂夫  发现导弹
Steve, I got a bogey.

927
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:01,190
距离不远  最多只剩30秒
Short-range ballistic. Thirty seconds, tops.

928
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:00,020
{\an8}导弹来袭

929
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:02,340
谁发射的
Who fired it?

930
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:03,320
神盾局
S.H.I.E.L.D.

931
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:07,080
我一直在拖延时间  队长
I am afraid I have been stalling, Captain.

932
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:10,790
认命吧  这样也是对你好
Admit it, it's better this way.

933
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:15,570
我们都一样  没时间了
We're both of us out of time.

934
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:40,020
把他叫来
Call in the asset.

935
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,040
我要走了  皮尔斯先生
I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce.

936
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:00,700
走之前还需要我做什么吗
You need anything before I leave?

937
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:04,620
不了  没事  勒娜特  你回家吧
No. It's fine, Renata, you can go home.

938
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:06,470
好的  晚安
Okay, night-night.

939
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:07,580
晚安
Good night.

940
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:14,700
要喝牛奶吗
Want some milk?

941
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:26,550
时间安排有变
The timetable has moved.

942
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,100
时间紧迫
Our window is limited.

943
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,240
两个六级目标
Two targets, Level six.

944
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:39,730
他们已经害我失去了佐拉
They already cost me Zola.

945
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:42,530
十小时之内都要杀死
I want confirmed death in ten hours.

946
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:46,760
抱歉  皮尔斯先生  我
Sorry, Mr. Pierce,  I...

947
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,480
忘记拿手机了
I forgot my phone.

948
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:58,280
勒娜特  你真该敲门的
Oh, Renata. I wish you would have knocked.

949
01:09:22,410 --> 01:09:23,440
早啊
Hey, man.

950
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:26,490
真抱歉  我们需要避避风头
I'm sorry about this. We need a place to lay low.

951
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,160
我们认识的人都想杀了我们
Everyone we know is trying to kill us.

952
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:33,060
我可不
Not everyone.

953
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:51,420
你没事吧
You okay?

954
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,470
没事
Yeah.

955
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:02,270
怎么了
What's going on?

956
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:06,860
我当初加入神盾局的时候
When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D,

957
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:08,560
还以为是走上了正路
I thought it was going straight.

958
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:15,960
结果也就是从克格勃换到了九头蛇
But I guess I just traded in the KGB for Hydra.

959
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:24,330
我本以为知道我在为谁撒谎  但...
I thought I knew whose lies I was telling, but...

960
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:29,620
现在我也分不清了
I guess I can't tell the difference anymore.

961
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:33,620
你可能是入错行了
There's a chance you might be in the wrong business.

962
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:39,850
我欠你个人情
I owe you.

963
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,390
没什么
It's okay.

964
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:44,480
换成是我
If it was the other way around,

965
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:47,850
你的命攥在我手里
and it was down to me to save your life,

966
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:49,530
说实话
and you be honest with me,

967
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:53,380
你会把性命托付给我吗
would you trust me to do it?

968
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:57,000
现在会了
I would now.

969
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:01,030
我从不说谎
And I'm always honest.

970
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:04,540
你刚发现自己白牺牲了一次
Well, you seem pretty chipper for someone

971
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:06,520
还能这么乐观
who just found out they died for nothing.

972
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:11,020
我知道对手是谁就很开心了
Well, I guess I just like to know who I'm fighting.

973
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:12,690
我做了早饭
I made breakfast.

974
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:16,010
你们吃人间烟火吧
If you guys eat that sort of thing.

975
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:18,810
问题是
So, the question is:

976
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:21,510
神盾局里有谁有能力在境内发射导弹
who in S.H.I.E.L.D could launch a domestic missile strike?

977
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:24,200
皮尔斯
Pierce.

978
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:25,130
他碰巧正坐在
Who happens to be sitting

979
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:27,200
全世界最安全的大楼顶层
on top of the most secure building in the world.

980
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,330
但他不是孤军奋战
But he's not working alone,

981
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:31,230
佐拉的算法在雷姆利亚星号上
Zola's algorithm was on the Lemurian Star.

982
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,780
贾斯珀·西特韦尔也在上面
So was Jasper Sitwell.

983
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:38,070
所以关键问题是
So, the real question is:

984
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:40,170
两个华盛顿的头号通缉犯
how do the two most wanted people in Washington

985
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,770
怎么在光天化日下绑架神盾局官员
kidnap a S.H.I.E.L.D officer in broad daylight?

986
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:45,510
答案是  不需要绑架
The answer is: you don't.

987
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:46,990
这是什么
What's this?

988
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:48,220
算是简历吧
Call it a resume.

989
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:52,960
这是巴马拉吗
Is this Bakhmala?

990
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:55,590
你参加了哈立德·汗迪尔任务
The Khalid Khandil mission, that was you.

991
01:11:56,590 --> 01:11:58,400
你可没说他是空降救援
You didn't say he was a para-rescue.

992
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:00,770
这是莱利吗
Is this Riley?

993
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:01,880
对
Yeah.

994
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,820
我听说因为有火箭弹  直升机飞不进去
I heard they couldn't bring in the choppers because of the RPGs.

995
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:06,190
你们用的是什么  隐形降落伞吗
What did you use, a stealth chute?

996
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:08,730
不  是这个
No. These.

997
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:15,530
你不是说你是飞行员吗
I thought you said you're a pilot.

998
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:17,270
我可没那么说
I never said a pilot.

999
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,810
我不能请你帮忙  山姆
I can't ask you to do this, Sam.

1000
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,580
你退役是有原因的
You got out for a good reason.

1001
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:26,550
伙计  美国队长需要我帮忙
Dude, Captain America needs my help.

1002
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,520
这理由还不够吗
There's no better reason to get back in.

1003
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,900
这东西哪能拿到
Where can we get our hands on one of these things?

1004
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,650
最后一套在米德堡
The last one is at Fort Meade,

1005
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:39,210
三道有守卫的门和一堵12英寸厚的钢墙后面
behind three guarded gates and a twelve-inch steel wall.

1006
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:42,770
应该没什么问题
Shouldn't be a problem.

1007
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,710
{\an8}猎鹰  机密

1008
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:46,280
我今晚得飞回家
Listen, I gotta fly home tonight,

1009
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:49,130
选区出了点问题
cause I got some constituency problem,

1010
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:51,160
我得处理一下
and I gotta press the flesh.

1011
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,770
是哪位选民有问题吗  参议员先生
Any constituent in particular, Mr. Senator?

1012
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,860
不算是吧
Uh...no, not really.

1013
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:59,900
23岁  有点火辣  相当辣
Twenty-three, kind of hot. Real hot.

1014
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:01,930
好像是想当个记者
You know, wants to be a reporter, I think.

1015
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:03,890
不记得了  谁有心思听她说话
I don't know, who listens at that point?

1016
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:05,680
好像不是什么问题啊
Doesn't sound much of a problem to me.

1017
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:08,210
是吗  她要把我的背累坏了
Really? Cause she's killing my back.

1018
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:10,630
这地方不适合谈这些
Look, this isn't the place to talk about it.

1019
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:11,880
别针不错
That's a nice pin.

1020
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:13,970
多谢夸奖
Thank you.

1021

抱一个

是啊  看到了
I just saw that, yeah.

1025
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,090
-我该去检查检查吗  -检查一下吧
- Should I get it checked? - I think so.

1026
01:13:30,930 --> 01:13:32,550
{\an8}亚历山大·皮尔斯来电

1027
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,860
你们先去把车开过来等我
I need a minute. Bring the car around.

1028
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:41,400
你好  长官

听说这里的蟹饼相当不错
I hear the crab cakes here are delicious.

1031
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:46,910
你是谁
Who is this?

1032
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:49,900
十点钟方向戴着墨镜的帅哥
The good looking guy in the sunglasses, your ten o'clock.

1033
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,320
另一个十点钟方向
Your other ten o'clock.

1034
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:56,550
看到了吧
There you go.

1035
01:13:58,870 --> 01:13:59,970
你想干什么
What do you want?

1036
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:02,580
你右转过拐角
You're gonna go around the corner, to your right.

1037
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,190
第二个车位上有辆灰色车
There's a grey car, two spaces down.

1038
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,900
我们去兜个风
You and I are gonna take a ride.

1039
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:08,910
我为什么要听你的
And why would I do that?

1040
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:12,080
因为那条领带看起来挺贵的
Because that tie looks really expensive,

1041
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:14,130
我不想给弄脏了
and I'd hate to mess it up.

1042
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,460
告诉我佐拉算法的事
Tell me about Zola's algorithm.

1043

01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,240
你在雷姆利亚星号上干了什么
What were you doing on the Lemurian Star?

1045
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,400
晕船了  一直在吐
I was throwing up, I get seasick.

1046
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:37,190
搞这出是想暗示
Is this little display meant to insinuate

1047
01:14:37,190 --> 01:14:38,840
你打算把我丢下屋顶吗
that you can throw me off the roof?

1048
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:41,500
这可不是你的作风  罗杰斯
Cause it's really not your style, Rogers.

1049
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:45,200
你说对了  的确不是
You're right. It's not.

1050
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:47,300
是她的作风
It's hers.

1051
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,230
等一下  会计部的那姑娘怎么样
Oh, wait. What about that girl from accounting,

叫劳拉

1053
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:55,690
是莉莉安  有唇环的那个吧
Lillian. Lip piercing, right?

1054
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:56,760
没错  她挺可爱的
Yeah, she's cute.

1055
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,720
我还没法接受唇环
Yeah, I'm not ready for that.

1056
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:12,120
佐拉算法是个程序
Zola's algorithm is a program...

1057
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,020
为洞察计划选择目标
for choosing Insight's targets!

1058
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:17,200

1066
01:15:30,710 --> 01:15:32,910
未来  它怎么预测未来
The Future? How could it know?

1067
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,510
当然可以
How could it not?

1068
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:42,450
21世纪就是一本电子书
The 21st century is a digital book.

1069
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:45,620
佐拉教会了九头蛇读懂它
Zola taught Hydra how to read it.

1070
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,050
你们的银行记录  病史
Your bank records, medical histories,

1071
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:52,900
投票倾向  电子邮件  打的电话
voting patterns, e-mails, phone calls,

1072
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:54,400
还有高考成绩
your damn SAT scores.

1073
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:59,110
佐拉算法通过分析人们的过去
Zola's algorithm evaluates peoples' past

1074
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,420
预测他们的未来
to predict their future.

1075
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:02,890
然后呢
And what then?

1076
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,950
老天  皮尔斯会杀了我的
Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.

1077
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:09,050
然后呢
What then?!

1078
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:15,510
然后洞察计划的天空航母会除掉他们
Then the Insight Helicarriers scratch people off the list.

1079
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:18,990
一次解决几百万人
A few millions at a time.

1080
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:27,940
九头蛇可不喜欢泄密者
Hydra doesn't like leaks.

1081
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:29,900
那你就把嘴塞上吧
So why don't you try sticking a cork in it.

1082
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,430
洞察计划16小时候后启动
Insight's launching in sixteen hours,

1083
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:32,700
我们时间有点紧
we're cutting it a little bit close here.

1084
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:34,630
我知道  我们用他绕过DNA扫描
I know. We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans

1085
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:36,280
直接上天空航母
and access the Helicarriers directly.

1086
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:38,040
什么  你们疯了吗
What?! Are you crazy?

1087
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:40,420
这主意糟透了
That is a terrible, terrible idea.

1088
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:24,980
我靠
Shit!

1089
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,320
抓紧
Hang on!

1090
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:19,400
她交给我
I have her.

1091
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:21,110
你们去找他
Find him.

1092
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,960
快走  这里交给我
Go, I got this!

1093
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:03,510
着陆地点  弗吉尼亚大道2300街区
I make an LZ, twenty-three hundred block at Virginia Avenue.

1094
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:04,780
两分钟后会合
Rendezvous two minutes.

1095
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:10,060
有平民受到威胁
Civilians threatened.

1096
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:12,170
重复  有平民受到威胁
Repeat, civilians threatened.

1097
01:21:16,150 --> 01:21:18,960
着陆地点  弗吉尼亚大道2300街区
I make an LZ, twenty-three hundred block at Virginia Avenue.

1098
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:20,140
{\an8}回放

1099
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,390
两分钟后会合
Rendezvous two minutes.

1100
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:48,230
让开  快让开
Get out of the way! Stay out of the way!

1101
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:36,780
巴基
Bucky?

1102
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:38,580
谁他妈是巴基
Who the hell is Bucky?

1103
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:09,240
放下盾牌  队长  跪在地上
Drop the shield, Captain! On your knees!

1104
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:12,040
跪在地上  快跪下  跪下
Get on your knees! Now! Get down! Get down!

1105
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:14,320
跪在地上  跪下
Get on your knees! Down!

1106
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:16,510
不许动
Don't move.

1107
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:27,220
把枪放下  别在这儿这样
Put the gun down. Not here. Not here!

1108
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:43,610
是他
It was him.

1109
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:49,560
他就这么看着我  却不认识我
He looked right at me and he didn't even know me.

1110
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:51,000
这怎么可能
How's that even possible?

1111
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,610
都过去七十年了
It was like seventy years ago.

1112
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:53,910
是佐拉干的
Zola.

1113
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,300
巴基所在的部队曾在1943年被俘
Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43,

1114
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:58,030
佐拉拿他们做过人体实验
Zola experimented on 'em.

1115
01:24:58,530 --> 01:25:00,670
可能就是因为这个  他摔下火车后活了下来
Whatever he did, it helped Bucky survive the fall.

1116
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:03,870
他们一定找到了他
They must have found him.

1117
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:05,690
这不是你的错  史蒂夫
None of that's your fault, Steve.

1118
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:11,290
我一无所有的时候  却还有巴基
Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.

1119
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,110
快找个医生过来
We need to get a doctor here.

1120
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:17,330
如果不压紧伤口
We don't put pressure on that wound

1121
01:25:17,330 --> 01:25:19,070
她会失血过多死在车上的
she's gonna bleed out here in the truck.

1122
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:29,160
这玩意压得我头疼
That thing was squeezing my brain.

1123
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:33,810
这人是谁
Who's this guy?

1124
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,010
三个坑  开挖吧
Three holes. Start digging.

1125
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:15,990
她中枪了  失血一品脱
GSW. She's lost at least a pint.

1126
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:16,810
也许有两品脱
Maybe two.

1127
01:26:16,810 --> 01:26:17,840
交给我吧
Let me take her!

1128
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,460
她会想先见见他的
She'll wants to see him first.

1129
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,300
终于来了
About damn time.

1130
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:36,880
脊柱损伤  胸骨断裂
Lacerated spinal column, cracked sternum,

1131
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:40,200
锁骨粉碎  肝穿孔
shattered collarbone, perforated liver,

1132
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:42,200
再加上要命的头疼
one hell of a headache.

1133
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,050
别忘了肺萎陷
Don't forget your collapsed lung.

1134
01:26:44,050 --> 01:26:47,700
对  这可不能忘了  除此之外都挺好
Oh, let's not forget that. Otherwise, I'm good.

1135
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:49,950
可他们给你做了开膛手术  你心跳都停了
They cut you open, your heart stopped.

1136
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:54,230
河豚毒素B  能把脉搏降到一分钟一下
Tetrodotoxin B. Slows the pulse to one beat a minute.

1137
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:56,290
班纳发明用来控制压力的
Banner developed it for stress.

1138
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:59,110
对他没多大作用  但我们发现了它的新用途
Didn't work so great for him, but we found a use for it.

1139
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:01,050
为什么要这么保密  为什么不告诉我们
Why all the secrecy? Why not just tell us?

1140
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:03,910
为了让意图谋害局长的人以为暗杀成功了
Any attempt on the director's life had to look successful.

1141
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:06,180
死人不能再被刺杀了
Can't kill you if you're already dead.

1142
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:11,000
另外  我也不知道还能相信谁
Besides, I wasn't sure who to trust.

1143
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:16,500
{\an8}银行

1144
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:27,650
巴恩斯中士
Sergeant Barnes...

1145
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:30,870
巴基  不
Bucky, no!

1146
01:27:34,150 --> 01:27:37,610
改造程序已经开始了
The procedure has already started.

1147
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:45,340
你将会成为九头蛇的新武器
You are to be the new face of Hydra.

1148
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:46,780
把他冷冻起来
Put him on ice.

1149
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:02,240
长官  他状态不稳定  情绪失常
Sir, he's...he's unstable. Erratic.

1150
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:17,510
任务汇报
Mission report.

1151
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,940
开始任务汇报
Mission report, now.

1152
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:36,110
桥上的那个人
The man on the bridge...

1153
01:28:39,150 --> 01:28:40,210
他是谁
Who was he?

1154
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,660
你这周早些时候执行另一个任务时见过他
You met him earlier this week on another assignment.

1155
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:48,490
我认识他
I knew him.

1156
01:28:57,190 --> 01:28:59,760
你做的事造福了全人类
Your work has been a gift to mankind.

1157
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:03,490
你塑造了这个世纪
You shaped this century,

1158
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:06,600
我需要你再做一次
and I need you to do it one more time.

1159
01:29:07,810 --> 01:29:11,330
人类社会正处在秩序与混乱的临界点
Society is at a tipping point between order and chaos.

1160
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,790
明天早上我们要帮他们抉择
Tomorrow morning we're gonna give it a push.

1161
01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:18,560
但如果你不完成你的任务  我就没法着手
But if you don't do your part, I can't do mine,

1162
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:23,610
九头蛇就没法还世界它应得的自由
and Hydra can't give the world the freedom it deserves.

1163
01:29:26,350 --> 01:29:27,600
可我认识他
But I knew him.

1164
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:35,570
给他准备
Prep him.

1165
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:38,880
他脱离低温冷冻太久了
He's been out of cryo-freeze too long.

1166
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:41,270
那就给他洗脑  重新来过
Then wipe him and start over.

1167
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:26,710
这个人拒绝了诺贝尔和平奖
This man declined the Nobel Peace Prize.

1168
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:26,310
{\an8}亚历山大·皮尔斯
参谋长联席会议

1169
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:30,630
他说  和平不是一项成就
He said, "Peace wasn't an achievement,

1170
01:30:30,910 --> 01:30:32,990
而是一种责任
it was a responsibility."

1171
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:37,940
就是这种事害我有信任危机
See, it's stuff like this that gives me trust issues.

1172
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,510
我们得阻止航母发射
We have to stop the launch.

1173
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:43,240
我觉得理事会不会再接我的电话了
I don't think the Council's accepting my calls anymore.

1174
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:46,410
这是什么
What's that?

1175
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:49,310
天空航母飞到三千英尺高后
Once the Helicarriers reach three thousand feet,

1176
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:51,670
会利用洞察卫星三角定位
they'll triangulate with Insight Satellites

1177
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:51,630
{\an8}洞察计划

1178
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:53,550
变成杀伤性武器
becoming fully weaponized.

1179
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:55,220
我们必须渗入航母
We need to breach those carriers

1180
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:58,180
将上面的定位模块换成我们自己的
and replace their targeting blades with our own.

1181
01:30:58,180 --> 01:30:59,180
只换一两个没用
One or two won't cut it.

1182
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:01,980
必须把三艘航母都连接到一起
We need to link all three carriers for this to work,

1183
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:05,070
因为即使只剩一艘航母正常运转
because if even one of those ships remains operational

1184
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,420
还是会死很多人
a whole lot of people are gonna die.

1185
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:10,940
我们必须假设航母上的都是九头蛇的人
We have to assume everyone aboard those carriers is Hydra.

1186
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,040
我们得闯过他们那一关
We need to get pass them,

1187
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,710
把模块插进服务器  也许
insert the server blades, and maybe,

1188
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:16,250
只是也许  我们可以挽救
just maybe, we can salvage what's left...

1189
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:17,730
我们什么都不挽救
We're not salvaging anything.

1190
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:19,210
我们不止要摧毁航母  尼克
We're not just taking down the carriers, Nick,

1191
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:20,290
我们还要推翻神盾局
we're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.

1192
01:31:20,290 --> 01:31:21,730
神盾局跟此事无关
S.H.I.E.L.D had nothing to do with it.

1193
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:24,110
你把任务交给我  我就要这么做
You gave me this mission, this is how it ends.

1194
01:31:24,110 --> 01:31:25,120
神盾局有问题
S.H.I.E.L.D's been compromised,

1195
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,390
这是你的原话
you've said so yourself.

1196
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:28,400
九头蛇在就你眼皮底下发展  却没人发现
Hydra was right under your nose and nobody noticed.

1197
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,430
你以为我们为什么在这个山洞里见面
Why do you think we're meeting in this cave?

1198
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:31,720
因为我发现了
I noticed.

1199
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,900
在你发现之前有多少人付出了生命的代价
And how many paid the price before you did?

1200
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:38,590
我真的不知道巴恩斯的事
Look, I didn't know about Barnes.

1201
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:40,450
就算你知道  你会告诉我吗
Even if you have, would you have told me?

1202
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,820
还是继续你所谓的各司其职
Or would you have compartmentalized that too?

1203
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:47,840
神盾局  九头蛇  一个都不能留
S.H.I.E.L.D, Hydra, it all goes.

1204
01:31:48,430 --> 01:31:49,400
他说得对
He's right.

1205
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:56,630
别看我
Don't look at me.

1206
01:31:56,630 --> 01:31:58,760
他做什么我就做什么  就是比他慢点
I do what he does, just slower.

1207
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:03,230
好吧
Well...

1208
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:12,860
看来现在要由你来下令了  队长
Looks like you're giving the orders now, Captain.

1209
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:25,800
我们完事后找过你
We looked for you after.

1210
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:29,150
我父母想开车送你从墓地回家
My folks wanted to give you a ride from the cemetery.

1211
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:30,070
我知道  很抱歉
I know, I'm sorry.

1212
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:32,780
我只是  想一个人待一会儿
I just kind of wanted to be alone.

1213
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:35,030
葬礼怎么样
How was it?

1214
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:38,970
就那样吧  我妈葬在了我爸旁
It was okay. She's next to Dad.

1215
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:42,620
我想问你...
I was gonna ask...

1216
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:45,240
我知道你想问什么  巴基  只是我...
I know what you're gonna say, Buck, I just...

1217
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:48,550
我们可以像小时候那样  把沙发垫铺在地板上
We can put the couch cushion on the floor like when we were kids.

1218
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:51,320
那多好啊  你只要帮我擦擦鞋
It'll be fun. All you gotta do is shine my shoes,

1219
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:53,450
或者倒个垃圾什么的就行了
maybe take out the trash.

1220
01:32:58,870 --> 01:32:59,930
来吧
Come on.

1221
01:33:03,370 --> 01:33:06,930
谢谢  巴基  不过我自己能行
Thank you, Buck, but I can get by on my own.

1222
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:11,140
问题是  你不必这样
The thing is, you don't have to.

1223
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:16,790
我会陪你走到最后的  哥们
I'm with you till the end of the line, pal.

1224
01:33:19,450 --> 01:33:20,940
他一定会在那儿的
He's gonna be there, you know?

1225
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:22,260
我知道
I know.

1226
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,380
听着  不管他以前怎么样  现在的他
Look, whoever he used to be, the guy he is now,

1227
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:29,010
你不能去拯救了
I don't think he's the kind you save.

1228
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:30,920
你需要阻止他
He's the kind you stop.

1229
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,020
我不知道我下不下得去手
I don't know if I could do that.

1230
01:33:35,410 --> 01:33:37,260
他也许会逼得你没得选
Well, he might not give you a choice.

1231
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:38,640
他不记得你了
He doesn't know you.

1232
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:40,650
他会记起来的
He will.

1233
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:45,350
时间到了  准备出发
Gear up, it's time.

1234
01:33:47,890 --> 01:33:48,900
你就穿这身去吗
You gonna wear that?

1235
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,490
不  要去打仗
No. If you're gonna fight a war,

1236
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:52,030
就得穿上军装
you gotta wear a uniform.

1237
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:05,030
完了  饭碗丢定了
Oh, man. I am so fired!

1238
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:31,430
进入发射的最后阶段
We are in final launch sequence.

1239
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:33,590
{\an8}洞察发射

1240
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,720
制导系统就绪
We are go on guidance.

1241
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:39,360
所有人员请前往发射台
All personnel, to launch station.

1242
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:41,360
飞行旅途如何
And how was your flight?

1243
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:44,680
很不错  不过从机场来这的路上不怎么样
Lovely. The ride from the airport less so.

1244
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:47,220
很遗憾神盾局没法控制一切
Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D can't control everything.

1245
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:49,390
包括美国队长
Including Captain America.

1246
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:55,790
大楼的身份认证靠生物识别
This facility is biometrically controlled,

1247
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:58,670
这胸章能让你们在这里畅行无阻
and these will give you unrestricted access.

1248
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:04,000
我把车停在那儿两个月了
I've been parking there for two months.

1249
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:04,950
可那是他的车位
But it's his spot.

1250
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:05,810
那他去哪了
So where's he been?

1251
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:07,130
大概去阿富汗了吧
I think Afghanistan.

1252
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:09,390
不可以  DT6  着陆航线已满
Negative, DT-6. The pattern is full.

1253
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:10,810
他该事先说明的
Well, he could have said something.

1254
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:13,790
天线出问题了吧
Must be the dish.

1255
01:35:15,490 --> 01:35:16,740
我去看看
I'll check it out.

1256
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:25,740
麻烦让一下
Excuse us.

1257
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:28,460
我知道过程很坎坷
I know the road hasn't exactly been smooth,

1258
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:30,020
你们中可能有人
and some of you would have

1259
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:32,400
早就看我不顺眼了
gladly kicked me out of the car along the way.

1260
01:35:34,330 --> 01:35:37,610
我们终于齐聚在这  全世界都将心存感激
Finally we're here, and the world should be grateful.

1261
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,500
所有神盾局特工注意
Attention, all S.H.I.E.L.D agents.

1262
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,040
我是史蒂夫·罗杰斯
This is Steve Rogers.

1263
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:46,450
这几天你们听到了不少我的消息
You've heard a lot about me over the last few days,

1264
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,630
有些人甚至奉命追捕我
some of you were even ordered to hunt me down.

1265
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,510
但我认为应该告诉你们真相
But I think it's time you know the truth.

1266
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:58,600
神盾局并不是我们想象的样子
S.H.I.E.L.D is not what we thought it was,

1267
01:35:58,870 --> 01:36:00,930
它已经被九头蛇渗透了
it's been taken over by Hydra.

1268
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:03,790
他们的首领是亚历山大·皮尔斯
Alexander Pierce is their leader.

1269
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:09,790
突击队和洞察计划的人也是九头蛇
The S.T.R.I.K.E and Insight crew are Hydra as well.

1270
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:13,830
我不知道还有多少  但他们就在这里
I don't know how many more, but I know they're in the building.

1271
01:36:15,190 --> 01:36:16,910
可能就站在你身边
They could be standing right next to you.

1272
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:22,870
他们差点如愿以偿  得到绝对控制权
They almost have what they want: absolute control.

1273
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:27,540
尼克·弗瑞的被害只是个开始
They shot the Nick Fury and it won't end there.

1274
01:36:27,710 --> 01:36:29,730
如果你们今天发射了天空航母
If you launch those helicarriers today,

1275
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:31,280
九头蛇将能够杀死
Hydra will be able to kill anyone

1276
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:32,780
所有妨碍他们计划的人
that stands in their way,

1277
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:36,750
除非我们阻止他们
unless we stop them.

1278
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:42,440
我知道这很难做到
I know I'm asking a lot,

1279
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:47,070
但自由的代价一向是高昂的
but the price of freedom is high, it always has been,

1280
01:36:47,790 --> 01:36:49,700
我愿意付出这代价
and it's a price I'm willing to pay.

1281
01:36:51,870 --> 01:36:54,370
哪怕只有我一个人  我也会坚持到底
And if I'm the only one, then so be it.

1282
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:58,050
但我相信我不是一个人
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.

1283
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,690
你是背的稿子
Did you write that down first,

1284
01:37:04,990 --> 01:37:06,570
还是临场发挥的
or was it off the top of your head?

1285
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:09,190
你这婊子养的
You smug son of a bitch.

1286
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:14,090
把他抓起来
Arrest him.

1287
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:17,960
看来还是我说了算
I guess I've got the floor.

1288
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:26,500
提前发射进程
Preempt the launch sequence,

1289
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,000
马上把航母送上天
send those ships up now.

1290
01:37:32,350 --> 01:37:33,570
你有意见吗
Is there a problem?

1291
01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:34,680
我
I'm...

1292
01:37:38,910 --> 01:37:39,970
你有意见吗
Is there a problem?

1293
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:41,060
抱歉  长官
I'm sorry, sir.

1294
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:51,570
我不会发射航母的
I'm not gonna launch those ships.

1295
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:56,100
队长有令
Captain's orders.

1296
01:37:56,350 --> 01:37:57,790
离开你的操作台
Move away from your station.

1297
01:37:58,180 --> 01:37:59,270
他说了
Like he said.

1298
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:03,490
队长有令
Captain's orders.

1299
01:38:05,210 --> 01:38:07,100
你站错边了  特工
You picked the wrong side, agent.

1300
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:09,980
那要看你的处境吧
Depends on where you're standing.

1301
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,060
{\an8}程序重写

1302
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:55,970
关闭舰湾闸门
Close the bay door!

1303
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:59,300
快关上闸门  快关上
Close the bay door now! Close the bay door!

1304
01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:20,510
他们启动发射了
They're initiating launch.

1305
01:39:40,130 --> 01:39:41,000
队长
Hey, Cap,

1306
01:39:41,010 --> 01:39:42,880
怎么区分坏人和好人
how do we know the good guys from the bad guys?

1307
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,800
朝你开枪的就是坏人
If they're shooting at you, they're bad.

1308
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:18,820
队长
Hey, Cap,

1309
01:40:19,030 --> 01:40:21,200
我碰到你说的坏人了
I found those bad guys you were talking about.

1310
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:22,110
你还好吗
You okay?

1311
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:25,590
还没死
Not dead yet.

1312
01:40:32,930 --> 01:40:34,420
容我问一个问题
Let me ask you a question.

1313
01:40:36,770 --> 01:40:39,760
如果巴基斯坦明天攻进了孟买
What if Pakistan marched into Mumbai tomorrow,

1314
01:40:41,230 --> 01:40:43,700
而你已经知道他们会把你女儿
and you knew that they were gonna drag your daughters

1315
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:46,900
拖到足球场里处决
into a soccer stadium for execution?

1316
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:50,250
你只需要按一下按钮
And you could just stop

1317
01:40:50,730 --> 01:40:54,870
就能阻止这一切  你会按吗  你们呢
it with a flick of a switch. Would you? Wouldn't you all?

1318
01:40:57,210 --> 01:40:59,270
我不要你的按钮
Not if it was your switch.

1319
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:24,490
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1320
01:41:30,990 --> 01:41:32,670
抢你风头了吗
Did I step on your moment?

1321
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:36,460
卫星到达三千英尺高度
Satellites in range at three thousand feet.

1322
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:38,630
猎鹰  情况如何
Falcon, status?

1323
01:41:38,630 --> 01:41:39,790
交战中
Engaging.

1324
01:42:03,930 --> 01:42:05,370
队长  我进来了
Alright, Cap, I'm in.

1325
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:08,930
我靠
Shit!

1326
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:40,520
还有八分钟  队长
Eight minutes, Cap.

1327
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:42,030
我在努力了
Working on it.

1328
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:51,550
你在做什么
What are you doing?

1329
01:42:51,550 --> 01:42:53,690
她在解除安全协议
She's disabling security protocols

1330
01:42:53,690 --> 01:42:55,470
把所有秘密公布到网上
and dumping all the secrets onto the Internet.

1331
01:42:55,470 --> 01:42:56,720
包括九头蛇的
Including Hydra's.

1332
01:42:56,730 --> 01:42:57,890
也有神盾局的
And S.H.I.E.L.D's.

1333
01:42:58,730 --> 01:42:59,410
一旦你这么做
If you do this,

1334
01:42:59,410 --> 01:43:01,550
你的过去就都大白于天下了
none of your past is gonna remain hidden.

1335
01:43:04,620 --> 01:43:06,030
你确定想让
Are you sure you're ready

1336
01:43:06,030 --> 01:43:08,340
全世界都看到你的真面目吗
for the world to see you as you really are?

1337
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:10,760
那你呢
Are you?

1338
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:28,380
A船替换完成
Alpha locked.

1339
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:32,090
猎鹰  你在哪里
Falcon, where are you now?

1340
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:33,540
我得先兜个圈子
I had to take a detour!

1341
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:14,490
我进来了
I'm in.

1342
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,060
B船替换完成
Bravo locked.

1343
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,130
解决两个  还剩一个
Two down, one to go.

1344
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:26,930
全体神盾局飞行员  紧急起飞
All S.H.I.E.L.D pilots, scramble.

1345
01:44:27,390 --> 01:44:30,130
我们是罗杰斯队长仅有的空中支援
We're the only air support Captain Rogers has got.

1346
01:45:11,150 --> 01:45:12,570
{\an8}访问受限

1347
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:15,240
解锁是行政命令
Disabling the encryption is an executive order,

1348
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:17,030
需要两名A级人员
it takes two Alpha Level members.

1349
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,400
别担心  人马上就到
Don't worry, company's coming.

1350
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:43,990
你收到我的花了吗
Did you get my flowers?

1351
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:48,040
我很高兴你能来  尼克
I'm glad you're here, Nick.

1352
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:48,940
是吗
Really?

1353
01:45:50,330 --> 01:45:52,410
因为我以为是你杀了我
Cause I thought you had me killed.

1354
01:45:52,410 --> 01:45:53,850
你知道游戏规则的
You know how the game works.

1355
01:45:54,830 --> 01:45:56,640
为什么让我做神盾局局长
So why make me head of S.H.I.E.L.D?

1356
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:58,000
因为你是我认识的
Cause you're the best

1357
01:45:58,040 --> 01:45:59,740
最好的  最无情的人
and the most ruthless person I ever met.

1358
01:45:59,740 --> 01:46:02,250
我是在尽力保护人民
I did what I did to protect people.

1359
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:05,390
我们的敌人就是你的敌人  尼克
Our enemies are your enemies, Nick.

1360
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:08,250
混乱  战争
Disorder, war.

1361
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:09,860
脏弹袭击莫斯科
It's just a matter of time

1362
01:46:09,860 --> 01:46:13,830
或者电磁脉冲瘫痪芝加哥只是迟早的事
before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow, or an EMP fries Chicago.

1363
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:19,470

也背叛过这个国家
both for this country and against it,

There's something I gotta do first.

1514
02:04:50,300 --> 02:04:53,350
你呢  威尔逊  我需要有你这样本事的人
How about you, Wilson? I could use a man with your abilities.

1515
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:55,910
比起间谍  我更喜欢当士兵
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

1516
02:04:56,770 --> 02:04:57,790
好吧
Alright then.

1517
02:05:03,100 --> 02:05:07,430
要是有人问起我  让他们来这里找我
Anybody asks for me, tell them they can find me right here.

1518
02:05:09,100 --> 02:05:09,650
你该感到荣幸
You should be honored,

1519
02:05:09,650 --> 02:05:12,290
这在他这儿  是最接近"谢谢"的了
that's about as close as he gets to saying thank you.

1520
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,760
你不跟他一起吗
Not going with him?

1521
02:05:15,410 --> 02:05:16,310
不
No.

1522
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:17,400
也不留下
Not staying here?

1523
02:05:19,580 --> 02:05:22,090
我的身份全都暴露了  我得去弄个新的
I blew all my covers, I gotta go figure out a new one.

1524
02:05:22,090 --> 02:05:23,140
那得花上一段时间
That might take a while.

1525
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:24,870
正好歇一阵子
I'm counting on it.

1526
02:05:27,220 --> 02:05:28,790
你要的那个东西
That thing you asked for,

1527
02:05:28,790 --> 02:05:31,200
我找基辅的几个朋友帮了些忙
I called in a few favors from Kiev.

1528
02:05:33,740 --> 02:05:37,140
算是帮我个忙  约那个护士吧
Will you do me a favor? Call that nurse.

1529
02:05:37,270 --> 02:05:38,400
她不是护士
She's not a nurse.

1530
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:40,310
你也不是神盾局特工
And you're not a S.H.I.E.L.D agent.

1531
02:05:41,290 --> 02:05:42,330
她叫什么来着
What was her name again?

1532
02:05:42,340 --> 02:05:45,390
莎伦  她很不错的
Sharon. She's nice.

1533
02:05:57,670 --> 02:05:58,800
小心点  史蒂夫
Be careful, Steve.

1534
02:06:00,260 --> 02:06:02,210
里面的东西你要做好心理准备
You might not want to pull on that thread.

1535
02:06:13,580 --> 02:06:14,600
你要去找他吗
You're going after him?

1536
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:16,990
你不必跟我一起来
You don't have to come with me.

1537
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:17,960
我知道
I know.

1538
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:21,220
什么时候出发
When do we start?

1539
02:08:15,830 --> 02:08:17,870
{\an2}美国队长2

1540
02:08:15,830 --> 02:08:17,870
{\an8}冬日战士

1541
02:08:20,730 --> 02:08:21,770
结束了
It's over.

1542
02:08:22,220 --> 02:08:24,490
弗瑞将一切都公之于众了
Fury has released everything to the public.

1543
02:08:25,210 --> 02:08:26,890
只公布了他知道的信息
Everything he knows about.

1544
02:08:26,970 --> 02:08:28,920
斯特拉克先生  如果他们知道我们在这里做的事
Mr. Strucker, if they get word of our work here,

1545
02:08:28,930 --> 02:08:30,890
如果他们知道我们服务于九头蛇
if they find out we serve Hydra...

1546
02:08:30,890 --> 02:08:33,160
九头蛇  神盾局
Hydra, S.H.I.E.L.D,

1547
02:08:33,700 --> 02:08:37,100
两个都一样  现在都不行了
two sides of a coin that's no longer currency.

1548
02:08:40,350 --> 02:08:41,790
我们拥有的东西
What we have

1549
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:46,410
价值是他们无法想象的
is worth more than any of them ever knew.

1550
02:08:49,160 --> 02:08:52,710
我们只接触到了点皮毛  就已经...
We've only scratched the surface and already...

1551
02:08:55,700 --> 02:09:00,020
世界上还有其他为九头蛇工作的机构
There are other facilities doing Hydra's good work around the world.

1552
02:09:00,680 --> 02:09:04,240
全丢给美国队长和他那帮乱七八糟的朋友
We'll feed them to Captain America and his colorful friends.

1553
02:09:04,340 --> 02:09:06,150
引开他们的注意
Keep them off our scent.

1554
02:09:06,450 --> 02:09:08,470
那些志愿者呢
What about the volunteers?

1555
02:09:08,770 --> 02:09:10,630
死了的会被埋得很深
The dead will be buried so deep

1556
02:09:10,630 --> 02:09:12,970
他们自己的魂魄都找不到
their own ghosts won't be able to find them.

1557
02:09:14,870 --> 02:09:16,190
幸存者呢
And the survivors?

1558
02:09:18,300 --> 02:09:19,450
那对双胞胎
The twins.

1559
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:26,330
他们迟早要见见双胞胎
Sooner or later they will meet the twins.

1560
02:09:28,580 --> 02:09:30,860
这已经不是间谍的世界了
It's not a world of spies anymore,

1561
02:09:30,860 --> 02:09:32,440
甚至也不是英雄的世界
not even a world of heroes.

1562
02:09:33,630 --> 02:09:36,680
这是属于奇迹的时代  博士
This is the age of miracles, doctor.

1563
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:43,450
没有什么比奇迹更恐怖了
There's nothing more horrifying than a miracle.

1564
