希望能快去快回
Hopefully, it's not for long,

00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,750
我们安顿好了会打给你的

等我更了解情况了的

不要  我不要你走
No. I don't want you to go.

48
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,680
肯定可无聊了
It's gonna be so boring.

00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,980
再见  亲爱的  我们很快就回来
Goodbye, sweetheart. All right, we'll see you soon.

52
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,070
好
Okay.

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,790
珍妮特  我们得走了
Janet, we gotta go.

54
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,890
真希望我们能够放下行李
I wish we could have put down our bags...

55
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,050
哄你上床
tucked you back into your bed...

56
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,750
但这事关太多性命
but too many lives were at stake.

57
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,760
天呐
Oh, my God.

58
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,350
已经发射了
They've already launched.

59
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,020
我们得拦截它
We have to stop it.

60
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,830
走吧
Come on.

61
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,840
要拆除导弹  我们必须进去
To disarm the missile, we had to get inside it

62
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,340
但外壳太厚了
but the plating was too thick.

63
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,480
如果想进去  只能缩小  钻过分子间隙
The only way in was to shrink between the molecules.

64
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,720
我钻不透
I can't get through.

汉克
Hank.

66
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,570
我们都清楚  如果缩小到那个程度
We both knew that if you go that small

67
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,340
就回不来了
there is no coming back.

68
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,780
本该是我去的  但我的调节器坏了
It should have been me, but my regulator was damaged.

69
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,280
你妈妈的还完好
Your mother's wasn't.

70
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,000
告诉霍普我爱她
Tell Hope I love her.

71
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,980
她关掉了它
She turned it off.

72
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,170
珍妮特  不要
Janet. No!

73
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,970
进入了亚原子状态好拆弹
She went subatomic to deactivate the bomb.

74
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,300
你母亲那天拯救了上千人的性命
Your mother saved thousands of lives that day

75
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,300
尽管她知道  她会迷失在量子域中
knowing she'd be lost in the quantum realm.

76
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,570
孤身一人
Alone.

77
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,160
充满恐惧
Afraid.

78
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,160
永远迷失
Gone forever.

79
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,540
告诉你她再不能回家
Telling you that she wasn't coming home

80
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,420
是我这辈子做过的最难的事
was the hardest thing that I ever had to do.

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,600
但后来斯科特出现了
But then Scott showed up.

82
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,000
或者该说  他闯进了我们家
Or should I say, broke into our house.

83
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,570
他进入量子域后
And when he went to the quantum realm...

84
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,310
却又回来了
and came back.

85
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,150
一切都变了
Everything changed.

86
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,900
我开始想
I started to wonder...

87
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,910
或许你妈妈还活着
could your mother still be alive?

88
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,410
所以我翻出了一些旧图纸
So, I dusted off some old plans.

89
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,690
爸爸  你是什么意思
Dad, what are you saying?

90
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,390
我们或许能救她回来
I think it's possible to bring her back.

91
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,770
好  我们进来了
Okay. We're in.

92
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,880
这地方就是个迷宫
Oh, this place is a maze.

93
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,300
地图呢
Where's that map?

94
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,800
我们绝对接近了
We're definitely close.

95
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,740
-准备好了吗  -好了  爸爸
- You ready? - I'm ready, Daddy.

96
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,680
确定吗  等我们进去了
Are you sure? 'Cause once we're inside,

97
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,190
如果你迟疑或害怕  我们就死定了
you show any hesitation or fear, we're done.

98
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,370
我拿恐惧当早餐吃
I eat fear for breakfast.

99
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,430
这太酷了
That is super cool.

100
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,680
来吧
Come on.

101
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,460
看  是安东  他会给我们指路的
Look! It's Anton. He'll show us the way.

102
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,300
安东  我们走哪边
Anton, which way do we go?

103
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,070
安东  我们走哪边
Anton, which way do we go?

104
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,010
谢谢  安东
Thanks, Anton!

105
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,850
看啊  蚂蚁打通进了科技设施
Look, the ants have burrowed into the tech facility.

106
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,890
不  激光
Oh no, lasers!

107
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,990
我好像碰到了激光
I think I got lased!

108
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,250
秘密宝库
The secret vault.

109
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,370
你带隐形眼镜来了吧
Tell me you brought the contact lens.

110
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,120
带了
Yup.

111
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,540
完美  对准那里
Perfect! Right there.

112
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,400
找到了  是微宝藏
There! It's the micro-treasure!

113
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,920
我的奖杯
My trophy?

114
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,160
看上去像宝藏
It looks like treasure.

115
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,450
对我来说是的
Oh, it is to me.

116
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,190
我想拿去做展示说明
I want to take it to show-and-tell.

117
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,400
那不行
Oh, no, you can't do that.

118
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,500
不行  它绝不能离开这栋房子
You can't. It never leaves the house.

119
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,600
它太重要了
It's too important.

120
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,020
这是你给我的最棒的生日礼物
This is the best birthday present you ever got me.

121
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,900
我觉得好感动
I'm so touched

122
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,790
你认为我是世界上最棒的奶奶
you think I'm the world's greatest grandma.

123
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,650
他们只有这一个了
It was the only one they had.

124
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,500
让我好想给你织件毛衣
It makes me want to knit you a sweater.

125
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,900
不  是条子
Oh, no, the fuzz!

126
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,850
斯科特
Hey, Scotty...

127
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,300
我在看卡拉佩特安大楼的图纸
I was looking at the schematics for the Karapetyan buildings...

128
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,190
我觉得我们装了太多的监控摄像头
and I think we have way too many security cameras, don't we?

129
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,450
完全没有
No, no, not at all.

130
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,060
因为  摄像头真的好多
I mean, 'cause it's a lot of security cameras.

131
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,100
我知道他需要什么
I know what he needs.

132
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,820
我们公司的安保专家是谁啊
Who's the security expert in our business?

133
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,450
是你  但经营公司的是我
You are, but I'm running the company, right?

134
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,050
如果我们开价太高
And if we overquote him...

135
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,930
他会去别家的
he's gonna go somewhere else.

136
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,190
我们一定要让这只大鸟到手
I mean, we gotta land this bird.

137
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,400
他不会去别家的
He ain't goin' anywhere.

138
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,850
而且那句俗语是"大鱼到手"
And the expression is "Land this fish."

139
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,530
不  是"大鸟到手"
No, it's "Land the bird."

140
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,680
就像"飞机到站"嘛
Just like you land the plane.

141
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,600
你得"飞机到站"才能维系生意
You gotta land the plane to be in business.

142
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,050
我知道纠结这种事挺傻的
I know it's silly to get hung up on these kinds of things,

143
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,090
-但我就这样  -鱼怎么能到手
- but I do. - How am I gonna land a fish?

144
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,280
它又不能走  如果它游上岸
It can't walk. And if it swam up on shore

145
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,540
跟鹰打一架  谁会赢
and it battled a hawk, who's gonna win?

146
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,050
这件事我真被你说服了
You've really turned me around on this thing.

147
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,020
没事  我们会把卡拉佩特安拿到手的
It's okay. We're gonna land Karapetyan.

148
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,110
失陪了
Now, if you just excuse me

149
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
我正在跟女儿偷东西呢
I'm in the middle of trying to steal something with my daughter.

150
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,230
我去重查一遍
I'm gonna go recheck it.

151
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,750
去找跑路蚁
To the escape ant!

152
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,670
趁条子还没回来  我们赶紧跑
Let's bounce before the po-po come back!

153
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,300
条子  这些词你都哪学的
The po-po? How do you even know that?

154
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,080
飞吧  安托瓦内特  飞吧
Let's fly, Antoinette! Let's fly!

155
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,070
硬着陆
Crash landing!

156
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,790
真希望我们能真缩小
I wish we could shrink for real.

157
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,180
那是挺酷的
That is pretty cool.

158
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,300
我去办公室了  斯科特
I'm headed to the office, Scotty.

159
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,930
抱歉我之前抓狂了
And sorry about freaking out earlier, you know.

160
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,130
但我觉得我好多了
But I feel like I'm way better.

161
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,430
我的心绝对跳得太快了
My heart is definitely beating way too hard and stuff.

162
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,390
我的手也在抖
And my hands are shaking.

163
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,880
但应该跟这没关系的吧
But I think it's unrelated, you know?

164
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,150
肯定很棒的  路易斯
It's gonna be great, Luis!

你完全不用担心
You got nothing to worry about!

166
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,820
是啊  我是老大  我最棒了
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss. I'm the boss.

167
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,640
我最厉害  好好好
I'm the boss. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

168
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,870
爸爸
Daddy!

169
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,300
拜托  吴  我只剩三天了
Come on, Woo! I've got three days left.

170
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,630
我为什么要企图逃跑
Why would I try to escape?

171
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,290
抱歉  斯科特  规矩就是规矩
Sorry, Scott, but rules are rules.

172
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,150
你触发了边界警报  我们就搜屋
You trip the perimeter alarm, we search the place.

173
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,760
角角落落都得搜到
Keel to stern, soup to nuts.

174
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,610
谢谢
Thank you.

175
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,870
就是个意外  我的脚穿透了栅栏
It was an accident. My foot went through the fence.

176
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,400
我们的飞蚁硬着陆了
Our flying ant crashed.

177
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,630
你试试在不能出屋的情况下
Hey, you try and entertain a 10-year-old

178
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,010
逗一个10岁小孩
when you can't leave the house.

179
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,750
知道我多努力吗
You know the lengths that I've gone to?

180
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,850
近景魔术
Close-up magic.

181
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,040
我学的
I learned that.

182
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,870
你为什么就不能放过我爸爸
Why can't you just leave my daddy alone?

183
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,150
凯西
Oh, Cassie.

184
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,370
这一切一定让你觉得像是
This must all seem like a bunch of

185
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,790
令人困惑的大人的事吧
confusing grown-up stuff to you, huh?

186
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,530
这么想吧
Well, think of it this way.

187
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,330
你们学校有校规吧
Your school has rules, right?

188
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,700
比如  不能在墙上乱涂乱画
Like, you can't draw on the walls.

189
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,410
你爸爸去了德国
Well, your daddy went to Germany

190
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,700
跟美国队长在墙上乱涂乱画来着
and drew on the walls with Captain America.

191
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,960
这违反了《索科威亚协议》
And that was a violation of Article 16,

192
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,450
第16款第三条
Paragraph Three of the Sokovia Accords.

193
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,410
按照他与国土安全部
Now, as a part of his joint plea deal

194
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,600
和德国政府签订的联合认罪协议
with Homeland Security and the German government

195
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,520
他可以回到美国
he was allowed to return to the U.S

196
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,020
前提是他服两年的软禁刑期
provided he serve two years under house arrest

197
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,980
和三年的假释
followed by three years of probation.

198
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,000
且不得擅自行动或使用未获批设备
And avoid any unauthorized activities, technology

199
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,160
或接触任何曾经
or contact with any former associates

200
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,410
或正在违反前述协议或任何相关法规的
who were or currently are in violation of said Accords.

201
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,390
旧同伙
Or any related statutes.

202
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,480
懂了吗  亲爱的
Okay, sweetie?

203
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,100
你还真会带小孩
You're really great with kids.

204
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,030
谢谢  我兼职做青年牧师的
Thanks. I'm also a youth pastor.

205
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,870
总之  不是我包打听
Anyway, not to be a Johnny ask-a-lot

206
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,180
但你最近没联系过
but you haven't had any contact

207
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,190
汉克·皮姆和霍普·凡·戴恩吧
with Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne, have you?

208
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,760
-没有  -真的吗
- No. - You sure?

209
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,850
因为我们迟早会抓到他们
Because it's only a matter of time before we get 'em.

210
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,550
那是他们的设备  所以他们也违反了协议
It was their tech, so they violated the Accords, too.

211
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,700
跟他们有联系是违反你的认罪协议的
And associating with them breaks your deal.

212
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,090
不用我提醒你
And, uh, I don't need to remind you

213
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,310
若对认罪协议有丝毫违反
that any violation of your agreement

214
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,580
就是至少20年的监狱刑期
means 20 years in prison. Minimum.

215
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,010
我好久没跟汉克和霍普联系过了
I haven't talked to Hank or Hope in forever.

216
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,290
他们恨死他了
They hate his guts.

217
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,410
谢谢  小花生
Thanks, peanut.

218
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,290
你怎么做到的  斯科特
How'd you do it, Scott?

219
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,690
做什么
Do what?

220
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,440
纸牌戏法
The card trick.

221
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,570
不是吧
Seriously?

222
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,880
天呐
Oh, my God!

223
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,910
你们不能高兴了就跑来
You people can't just show up here whenever you want

224
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,180
然后搜查这里
and search the place.

225
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,270
其实  他们可以的
Actually, they can.

226
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,200
你需要搜查令
You need a warrant.

227
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,310
其实  他们不需要
Actually, they don't.

228
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,210
真的吗
Really?

229
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,430
带足球鞋了吗
Did you pack your soccer shoes?

230
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,880
-嗯  -好
- Yeah. - All right.

231
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,730
下次我再见你  就是在外面了
Next time I see you will be on the outside.

232
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,600
好
All right.

233
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,830
我也要抱抱
Get on the inside of this.

234
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,080
三天了  真的
Hey, three days. Seriously...

235
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,500
-为你骄傲  哥们  -谢谢
- I'm proud of you, bud. - Thank you.

236
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,740
知道吗  再来一个
You know what? Give me another one.

237
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,340
我也是  天呐  自由
Me too! Gosh! Freedom!

238
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,030
新生意  我觉得你前途无量
New business! I am sensing greatness.

239
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,700
我这周末很开心  爸爸
I had a fun weekend, Daddy.

240
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,850
我也是  小花生  等下周末的
Me too, peanut. But just wait till next weekend.

241
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,260
等我能出屋了  我们要出去疯玩
Once I'm outta here, you and I are gonna go paint this town red.

242
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,060
我们要吃一大堆冰淇淋  然后吐个不停
We'll have so much ice cream, we'll never stop puking.

243
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,650
你越来越厉害了
You're gettin' good at that.

244
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,290
怎么做到的
How'd you do that?

245
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,250
-再见  爸爸  -再见
- Bye, Daddy. - Bye.

246
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,780
-再见  -再见
- Bye. - Bye.

247
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,200
三天
Three days.

248
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,100
轻松
Easy-peasy.

249
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,760
打指响  让他们看这边
Snap your fingers. That gets them to look over there.

250
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,570
这叫做误导
And that is misdirection.

251
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,270
我们曾梦想
We had a dream

252
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,480
会一起去旅行
We'd go travelin' together

253
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,970
我们散播一点爱意  然后继续向前
We'd spread a little lovin' then we'd keep movin' on

254
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,110
轻松
Easy-peasy.

255
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,370
你在哪
Where are you?

256
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,910
你所知的一切
Everything that you know...

257
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,260
迷失在
Lost...

258
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,050
量子域里
in the quantum realm.

259
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,210
什么
What?

260
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,780
我要找到你  小糖豆
I'm gonna find you, Jellybean.

261
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,520
我找到你了
I found you!

262
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,380
你总能找到我  妈妈
You always find me, Mommy.

263
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,650
怎么回事
What the hell?

264
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,530
汉克  好久没联系了
Hank! It's been a while.

265
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,230
我都不知道这是否还是你的号码
I don't even know if this is your number anymore.

266
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,620
我可能是你最不想联系的人了
And I'm probably the last person you wanna hear from. But

267
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,760
但我刚做了个特奇怪的梦
I just had a really weird dream.

268
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,380
我知道这听上去不像是什么急事
And I know that doesn't sound like an emergency or anything...

269
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,070
但感觉特别真实
but it just felt very real.

270
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,750
我又回到了量子域
I was back in the quantum realm...

271
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,880
我觉得我看到了你妻子
and I think I saw your wife.

272
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,540
然后我变成你妻子了
And then I was your wife.

273
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,930
不是什么奇怪的意思
I mean, not in a weird way or anything.

274
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,030
其实  我这么说出来
You know, hearing this out loud,

275
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,720
我开始觉得  这事真不急
I'm thinking, uh, it's not an emergency.

276
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,120
抱歉打扰你了
I'm sorry to bother you.

277
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,730
我对很多事都感到抱歉
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

278
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,780
就是说  我手指甲上的一颗小原子
That means, one tiny atom in my fingernail

279
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,930
-就可能...  -可能是个
- could be... - Could be one, little,

280
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,900
小宇宙
tiny universe.

281
00:13:59,190 --> 00:13:59,900
霍普
Hope?

282
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,620
这又是梦吗
Is this another dream?

283
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,580
你觉得那是梦吗
Do you think it was a dream

284
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,410
还是说你真有可能在那里看到了我妈妈
or is it possible that you really saw my mom down there?

285
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,410
我不确定
I'm not sure.

286
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,320
我不能在这儿
I can't be here!

287
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,370
我不能在这儿  我在服软禁刑期
I can't be here! I'm under house arrest!

288
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,300
系统运行时是打不开的  斯科特
They won't open while the system's engaged, Scott.

289
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,570
你得带我回家  他们随时可能会上门
You have to take me home. They could show up any second!

290
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,390
放松  就你的保姆警察所知
Relax. As far as your nanny cops know,

291
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,550
你还在家呢
you're still at home.

292
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,280
斯科特
Scotty?

293
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,830
他已被编程好复制你的日常活动
He's programmed to replicate your daily routine.

294
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,970
九小时睡觉
Nine hours in bed.

295
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,330
五小时看电视
Five hours in front of the TV.

296
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,730
两小时泡在厕所  不管是为啥
Two hours in the bathroom, whatever that's about.

297
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,400
这根本不准确
That's totally inaccurate.

298
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,110
你怎么会知道我的日常活动
And how do you know about my daily routine?

299
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,020
你在监视我吗
Are you spying on me?

300
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,920
我们注意一切安全隐患
We keep tabs on all security threats, all right?

301
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,980
而目前为止  你是最大的一个
And so far the biggest one we've had is you.

302
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,560
德国的事我很抱歉  是他们跑来找我
I'm sorry about Germany. They just showed up.

303
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,090
还说事关国家安全
They said it was a matter of national security.

304
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,110
美队需要帮助  所以...
That Cap needed help, so...

305
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,900
美队
Cap?

306
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,240
...国队长  美国队长  美队
Tain America. Captain. Cap.

307
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,400
我们就这么喊他
It's what we call him.

308
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,700
朋友之间
If you're a friend.

309
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,990
我倒不是说我算是朋友...算是吧
I'm not saying I'm a friend of... A little,

310
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,680
我认识他  他人挺好  不说了
I know him. He's nice. Whatever.

311
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,600
对不起  好吗  我没想到我会被抓
I'm sorry! All right? I didn't think I'd get caught.

312
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,270
你没想的事多了
You didn't think about a lot of things.

313
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,500
汉克怎么样
How's Hank?

314
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,480
我们还在逃跑
We're still running.

315
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,120
房子没了  我们的自由也没了
The house is gone, so is our freedom.

316
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,300
你觉得他会怎么样
How do you think he is?

317
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,550
对不起  我知道你生我气
I'm sorry. I know you're mad.

318
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,120
我要的不是道歉  斯科特
I'm not looking for an apology, Scott.

319
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,470
我之所以还跟你说话
The only reason why we're even talking

320
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,440
是因为我们需要你脑子里的东西
is because we need what's in your head.

321
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,320
这是你们住的地方吗
Is this where you're living?

322
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,790
如果你们需要帮助或钱  或许我可以...
If you need help or money or something, maybe I can...

323
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,730
不用
We're fine.

324
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,860
汉克  听着  我只想...
Hank. Look, I just wanna...

325
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,830
省省吧
Save it!

326
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,090
-可以开始了吗  -嗯
- Can we start? - Yeah.

327
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,690
你在家放松的时候
So, while you were relaxing at home

328
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,180
我们建了这个
we were building this.

329
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,170
是个隧道  通往量子域
It's a tunnel. To the quantum realm.

330
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,150
去找我妈妈
To my mom.

331
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,820
我们认为她可能还在那里
We think she might still be down there.

332
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,970
但我们不知道在哪
We just don't know where.

333
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,770
什么
What?

334
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,370
如果我们能定位出我妈的位置
If we can pinpoint my mom's location...

335
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,170
那我就能开驾驶舱去救她
then the pod can take me down to get her.

336
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,110
你们建造了这一切
You built all this

337
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,200
却都不能确定她是不是还活着吗
and you don't even know if she's alive?

338
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,260
这叫假设
It's called a hypothesis.

339
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,980
昨晚我们第一次启动了隧道
Last night, we powered up the tunnel for the first time.

340
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,100
但过载  于是关停了
It was overloaded and it shut down.

341
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,750
但就在那一瞬间
But for a split second,

342
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,430
通往量子域的大门被打开了
the doorway to the quantum realm was opened.

343
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:21,880
然后呢
And?

344
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,380
五分钟后  你打了来  说起了我妈妈
And five minutes later, you called, talking about Mom.

345
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,860
我们认为你去那下面时
We think when you were down there,

346
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,660
可能跟她发生了纠缠
you may have entangled with her.

347
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,550
汉克  我绝不会那么做的
Hank, I would never do that.

348
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,890
我是尊重你的
I respect you too much.

349
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,400
量子纠缠  斯科特
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

350
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,190
我们认为她可能
We think she might have

351
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,230
在你脑袋里放了信息
put some kind of a message in your head.

352
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,830
希望是个位置信息
Hopefully, a location.

353
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,780
打开隧道时  信息被触发了
And opening the tunnel triggered it.

354
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,540
你妈妈在我脑袋里留了信息
Your mom put a message in my head?

355
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,340
拜托  这疯了
Come on. That's insane.

356
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,490
不  斯科特
No, Scott.

357
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,530
疯狂
Insane

358
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,480
是不告诉我们就跑去德国跟复仇者联盟打架
is going to Germany without telling us, and fighting the Avengers.

359
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,910
告诉我  关于你偷的战衣  你没撒谎
Just tell me you weren't lying about the suit you took.

360
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,560
告诉我你确实销毁了它
Tell me you really destroyed it.

361
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,980
是的  我销毁了它  我发誓
I did, I destroyed it, I swear.

362
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,450
我真不敢相信你销毁了我的战衣
I can't believe you destroyed my suit!

363
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,750
那可是我的毕生心血
That was my life's work!

364
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,030
我还能怎么办
What was I supposed to do?

365
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,740
你就不该偷走我的战衣
You were supposed to not take my suit!

366
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,110
对不起  汉克
I'm sorry, Hank!

367
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,470
对不起我偷走了战衣
I'm sorry I took the suit.

368
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,410
对不起我昨晚打了电话
I'm sorry that I called last night.

369
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,090
我不记得在下面见过珍妮特
I don't remember seeing Janet down there.

370
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,360
我也希望我见过
I wish that I did.

371
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,170
我就是梦到了她
I just had a dream about her

372
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,130
跟一个小姑娘玩捉迷藏
playing hide-and-seek with a little girl.

373
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,230
什么
What?

374
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,580
我做了个梦
I had a dream.

375
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,470
她在跟个小姑娘玩捉迷藏
She was playing hide-and-seek with a little girl.

376
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,340
凯西和我以前常玩的
Cassie and I do it all the time.

377
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,660
没什么意义
Doesn't mean anything.

378
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,850
但梦里的是凯西吗
But was it Cassie in the dream?

379
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:35,890
不是
No.

380
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,520
她藏在了哪里
Where was she hiding?

381
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,910
-什么  -那个小姑娘
- What? - The little girl.

382
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,060
她藏在了哪里  大衣柜吗
Where was she hiding? Was it in a wardrobe?

383
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,310
不是  是个很大的柜子
No, it was in a tall dresser.

384
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,610
就是大衣柜咯
You mean a wardrobe.

385
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,810
是这么叫的吗
Is that what that's called?

386
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,490
什么颜色的
What color was it?

387
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,160
红的
Red.

388
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,060
上面有小马吗
Were there horses on it?

389
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,490
天呐
Oh, boy.

390
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,890
我们玩时  我每次都藏在那里
It's where I hid every time that we played.

391
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,280
听上去
It doesn't sound like

392
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,500
你没太理解这游戏的要义
you really got the gist of the game.

393
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,540
她还活着
She's alive.

394
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,940
我就知道
I knew it.

395
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,460
我就知道
I knew it!

396
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,380
我们得拿到那个部件
We need to get that part.

397
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,290
好
Okay.

398
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,880
我们越早让隧道正常运作
The sooner we get the tunnel working...

399
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,710
就能越早从他脑袋里提取到信息
the sooner we can get this message out of his head.

400
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,700
伯奇拿到了吗
Does Burch have it?

401
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,310
-是的  我们走  -什么部件
- Yeah. Let's go. - What part?

402
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,810
伯奇是谁  等等  什么情况啊
Who's Burch? Wait. What's happening?

403
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,780
我们需要一个部件
We need a component

404
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,900
来防止隧道再次过载
to stop the tunnel from overloading again.

405
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,320
我帮你拿了衣服  你最好换一下
I grabbed your clothes. You might want to change.

406
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,310
听着  我也想帮你们
Look, I'd really like to help you...

407
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,880
但如果他们来给我摘脚环时我不在家
but if I'm not at home when they come to take off my ankle monitor

408
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,210
那我就要蹲一辈子了
then I'm going away forever.

409
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,410
等我们拿到了部件  启动了隧道
Once we get the component and power up the tunnel

410
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,480
就能拿到信息  你午饭前就能回到家
we'll get the message, and have you home by lunch.

411
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,940
我们得快点  纠缠不会维持太久
We have to hurry. The entanglement won't last.

412
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,140
你欠我们的
You owe us.

413
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,680
好吧  我能不能进去等
All right, fine. But can I just wait inside?

414
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,370
因为我不该在外面的
Because I'm not supposed to be out here.

415
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,340
走吧
Let's go.

416
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,650
-没问题吧  -嗯
- We good? - Yeah.

417
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,580
我就回来
I'll be right back.

418
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,430
-我能吃个吗  -不能
- Can I have one of these? - No.

419
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,470
苏珊  欢迎来到好餐厅
Susan! Welcome to Oui!

420
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,130
桑尼
Sonny!

421
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,530
"好"是法语"是"的意思
Oui is French for "Yes."

422
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,720
立意就是  是从农场直接上餐桌的本地好料
As in "Yes" to farm-to-table, "Yes" to locally sourced...

423
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,110
是把生态摆在利益之前的好策略
and "Yes" to planet before profit.

424
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,010
那希望"你是否拿到了
Well, let's hope it also means "Yes"

425
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,930
我订购的部件"的答案也是"是"
to "Do you have the component I ordered?"

426
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,520
我一向喜欢你的幽默感  苏珊
You know, I have always loved your sense of humor, Susan.

430
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,490
桑尼·伯奇  黑市科技走私贩
Sonny Burch. He traffics in black market technology.

431
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,170
他为我们取得了建造隧道需要的材料
He's been getting us what we need to build the tunnel.

432
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,370
能给我一个...
Could I just have one...

433
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,600
不能
No.

434
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,310
我在联调局有个特别的朋友
You know, I have a special friend at the FBI.

435
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,900
我说"特别"是因为
And I say "Special" because,

436
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,640
他会告诉我些我原本不知道的事
well, he tells me things that I didn't previously know.

437
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,470
比如说
For example...

438
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,090
你名字不叫苏珊
your name isn't Susan.

439
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,220
而是霍普·凡·戴恩
It's Hope Van Dyne.

440
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,670
而你背后的同伙是你父亲  汉克·皮姆
And your unseen associate, that's your father, Hank Pym.

441
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,940
-这可不妙  汉克  -还用你说
- That's not good, Hank. - No shit.

442
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,240
你想要什么
What do you want?

443
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,980
关系是建立在信任上的  霍普
Relationships are built on trust, Hope.

444
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,840
我希望我们的关系有坚实的基础
And I want our relationship to have a strong foundation.

445
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,050
我们的关系
Our relationship?

446
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,640
我的市场在变化  霍普
My business landscape has been shifting, Hope.

447
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,090
神盾局和九头蛇都不存在了
Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA don't even exist anymore...

448
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,330
但汉克·皮姆呢
but now, Hank Pym...

449
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,500
汉克·皮姆是个好机会
Hank Pym is a real opportunity.

450
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,630
你到底想说什么
Do you have a point?

451
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,640
你以为我不知道
Oh, you think that I don't know

452
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,530
你要这些是在建造什么吗
what you've been building with all this?

453
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,510
量子科技
Quantum technology.

454
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,680
什么纳米科技啊  人工智能啊
Now, you can forget nanotech, forget AI,

455
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,920
加密货币都过时了
forget cryptocurrency.

456
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,790
量子科技才是未来
Quantum energy is the future.

457
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,690
是下一阵淘金热
It's the next gold rush.

458
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,410
是吗
Is that so?

459
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,640
我要加入  霍普
I want in, Hope.

460
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,960
所以  出于好意  我已经擅自
So, as a gesture of good will, I have taken the liberty

461
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,330
为你的实验室安排了买家
of arranging some buyers for your lab.

462
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,800
起价
Starting bid

463
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,610
是十亿美金
one billion dollars.

464
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,390
谢谢  桑尼  真的
Thank you, Sonny, really.

465
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,540
但我父亲和我有件
But my father and I have something

466
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,370
比成立公司要更紧急的事
slightly more pressing than starting a business.

467
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,360
所以我还是按说好的拿走部件
So I'll just take the component as arranged.

468
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,860
我的买家不接受拒绝
My buyers don't take no for an answer.

469
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,220
所以  我们要么一起做生意
So, we are either in business together

470
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,470
要么就不做生意了
or we aren't in business together.

471
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,250
那就不做吧
Then I guess we aren't.

472
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,830
你可以走
You can go.

473
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,050
但你的钱恐怕得留下
But I'm afraid your money's gonna have to remain.

474
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,740
就当是赔偿我受伤的感情
Let's call it compensation for my injured feelings.

475
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,820
听着  桑尼
Listen, Sonny.

476
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,660
如果你痛快把部件给我
This is gonna be so much easier on everybody

477
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,390
对大家都会简单得多
if you just give me that component.

478
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,440
亲爱的  你唯一可以拿走的
Darlin', the only thing you're takin' from here...

479
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,900
就是我的心  但它会渐渐愈合的
is my heart, but it will mend in time.

480
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,830
好吧
Okay.

481
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,320
现在怎么办
So, now what?

482
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,720
等着瞧
You'll see.

483
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,070
她说她和她爸有什么要紧事
She said her and her daddy had something pressing.

484
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,040
我要知道是什么事
I want to know what it is

485
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,470
因为如果他们没在跟我们合作
because if they're not working with us

486
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,720
就肯定在跟别人合作
they're working with somebody.

487
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,260
去查明  我要知道名字
So find out. I want some names...

488
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,710
等等  你给她加了翅膀
Hold on, you gave her wings?

489
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,750
抓到她
Get her.

490
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,100
别打碎我的世纪之交大吊灯
Not my turn-of-the-century chandelier!

491
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,180
别开枪了  住手
Stop firing! Stop!

492
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,330
好吧  拿上这个  快走
All right, take this. Go. Go, go, go!

493
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:38,970
快走
Go!

494
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,680
翅膀还有爆能枪
Wings and blasters.

495
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,910
看来我那时候这技术还没开发好咯
So I take it you didn't have that tech available for me.

496
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,040
开发好了
No, I did.

497
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,870
很高兴跟你做生意  桑尼
It was a pleasure doing business with you, Sonny.

498
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,840
我们的事还没完呢  霍普
Oh, our business isn't finished yet, Hope.

499
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,760
我可以向你保证
I can assure you of that!

500
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,720
那是什么
What in the hell is that?

501
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,020
爸爸  你看到了吗
Dad, are you seeing this?

502
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,600
霍普  快跑
Hope, get out of there!

503
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,730
-我得做点什么  -等等
- I gotta do something. - Wait!

504
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,250
还没完成
It is still a work in progress.

505
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,210
那一踢是你教我的  记得吗
You taught me that kick. Remember?

506
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,440
嗯  姿势很棒
Yeah, great form.

507
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,370
想当年啊  我们是怎么了
Those were the days. Whatever happened to us?

508
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,040
不是时候  斯科特
Not the time, Scott.

509
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,500
该死  它哪去了
Damn it, where'd it go?

510
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,030
我跟丢了
I've lost it.

511
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,550
蚂蚁摄像头上什么都看不到
I'm not seeing anything on the ant cams.

512
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,450
去看看...
Try looking...

513
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,380
爸爸
Dad?

514
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,470
把那个给我
Give me that.

515
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,540
快点
Now.

516
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,440
-你没事吧  -有事
- Are you okay? - No!

517
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,700
他拿了实验室
He got the lab.

518
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,930
-不  -快走
- No. - Come on!

519
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,120
那是什么
What was that?

520
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,610
我不知道
I don't know.

521
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,490
但我们得找个地方重新部署
But we need to find somewhere to regroup

522
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,320
并查明实验室在哪
and figure out where the lab is.

523
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,400
现在去哪
So, where to now?

524
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,210
我家吧
How about my house?

525
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,820
我反正也该在那儿的
I'm supposed to be there anyway,

526
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,680
吴随时都可能到
and Woo could walk in any second.

527
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,590
所以我们绝不能去你家
Exactly why we're not going to your house.

528
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,790
那你家呢
What about your house?

529
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:56,730
抱歉
Sorry.

530
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,450
那我只能想到一个地方了
Well, there is one place I can think of.

531
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,470
不
No.

532
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,210
不不
No, no, no, no!

533
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,030
不
No!

534
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,520
皮姆博士
Dr. Pym

535
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,980
谁能想到
like, who would've thought that,

536
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,840
您再次在危难时刻
once again, in your hour of need

537
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,440
找到了我们
that you would turn to us, you know?

538
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,070
我是没想到
Not me.

539
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:20,840
自便
Help yourself.

540
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,600
干吗买这么高档的点心
What's up with the fancy pastry?

541
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,920
我们得控制食物预算
We gotta keep the food budget down.

542
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,980
那我们早餐该吃什么
Well, what are we supposed to have for breakfast?

543
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,250
燕麦片
The oatmeal packets.

544
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,720
燕麦片
Oatmeal packets.

545
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,430
-这是侮辱  -怎么是侮辱了
- It's insult. - Why is it an insult?

546
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,520
因为那味道像沙子
Because it tastes like sand.

547
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,150
知道为什么吗  因为那是有机食品
You know why? 'Cause it's organic.

548
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,520
不是有机食品  是沙子
It's not organic, it's sand.

549
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,640
那可是一天最重要的一餐
It's the most important meal of the day.

550
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,800
你可以随意发挥嘛
You know what, you can get creative with it.

551
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,530
能硌断牙
Break teeth.

552
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,580
撒点红糖  撒点肉桂
Put a little brown sugar on it. You can put some cinnamon.

553
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,090
倒点蜂蜜
Put a little honey.

554
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,230
-随心所欲  -伙计们
- Whatever you want... - Guys, guys, guys.

555
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,490
干什么啊
Come on, man.

556
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,440
我们还有更要紧的事呢
We got bigger fish to fry.

557
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,670
那是我的桌子吗
Is that my desk?

558
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,980
-是的  -什么
- Yeah. - What?

559
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,370
为什么我的桌子那么小
Why do I have such a small desk?

560
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,920
因为我们选桌子时你又不在
Because you weren't there when we were choosing desks.

561
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,140
打瞌睡  没得选
You snooze, you lose.

562
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,310
我在被软禁啊
Well, I was under house arrest.

563
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:54,860
是啊
Yeah.

564
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,250
知道吗  这都算不上是桌子
You know what, this isn't even a desk.

565
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,250
这是垃圾
This is garbage.

566
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,930
你们是在外面的垃圾里找来的
You found this outside amongst garbage.

567
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,210
是在旧物义卖上淘来的
I got it at a rummage sale.

568
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,920
你就偏在我的桌子上省钱
So, you save money on my desk?

569
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,650
行了
Guys.

570
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,240
霍普  拜托  我们得集中精神
Hope, please, we need to focus, all right?

571
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,640
我们得赶紧找到那个实验室  天呐
We gotta find that lab already. Jeez.

572
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,120
知道吗  我听说了你的遭遇
Oh, you know what? I heard stories, like what happened to you.

573
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,560
说有个吓人的家伙  能钻墙
This crazy, creepy cat, who walks through walls and stuff.

574
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,250
像个幽灵
Like a ghost.

575
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,990
像雅加婆婆
Like Baba Yaga.

576
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,910
雅加婆婆  女巫
Baba Yaga, the witch.

577
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,160
他们给小孩子讲故事吓唬他们
They tell stories to children to frighten them.

578
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,930
你知道雅加婆婆吗
You know Baba Yaga?

579
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,640
不管是谁偷的
Whoever stole it...

580
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,050
我们得找到它
we need to find it.

581
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,620
那样的人是找不到的  得等他们找你
Oh, you don't find someone like that. They find you.

582
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,230
就像雅加婆婆
Like Baba Yaga.

583
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,410
皮姆博士  你是我认识的最聪明的天才
Dr. Pym, you're the smartest genius I know.

584
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,820
你没有在实验室上安装寻回系统吗
Didn't you put some kind of LoJack on your lab?

585
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,800
因为如果你没有
Because if you didn't,

586
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,110
我们这里有很多价钱公道的选择
we have a variety of affordable options.

587
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,130
我当然安装了  路易斯
Of course I did, Luis.

588
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,710
系统被解除了
It was disabled.

589
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,590
偷走实验室的人非常在行
Whoever stole the lab knew exactly what they were doing.

590
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,490
那人看上去好像还在变相
They also looked like they were phasing.

591
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,430
变相
Phasing?

592
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,570
量子变相
Quantum phasing.

593
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,900
就是物体在物质的各状态间变化
When an object moves through different states of matter.

594
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,720
是啊  我想的也是那个
Oh, yeah, that's what I was thinking.

595
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,050
实验室释放辐射
The lab emits radiation.

596
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,770
我们可以改造一台量子光谱仪追踪它吗
Can we modify a quantum spectrometer and track it?

597
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,920
那是可行的  但我的设备都在实验室里
That could work, yes, but all my equipment is in the lab.

598
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,600
还有哪里有那样的设备
Where else can we find that equipment?

599
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,210
是有那么个人
Well, there is one person.

600
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,740
比尔·福斯特
Bill Foster.

601
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,430
好啊
Great!

602
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,050
那是谁
Who's Bill Foster?

603
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,940
他是我爸爸的一个老同事  神盾局的
He's an old colleague of my dad's, from S.H.I.E.L.D.

604
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,350
他们多年前就闹崩了
They had a falling out years ago.

605
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,580
你似乎经常跟人闹崩
You seem to have a lot of falling outs with people.

606
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,490
可能只是浪费时间
It's probably just a waste of time.

607
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,840
我光是在这里可就是赌上了一切
I'm risking everything by being here.

608
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,180
你不觉得我们该去问问吗
Don't you think we should check?

609
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,310
我们得查明是谁偷走了实验室
We need to find out who took the lab.

610
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,000
伙计们  这样暴露在外可不太好
Guys, it's not a good idea to be out in the open like this.

611
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,040
放松  没人会认出我们的
Relax, no one's gonna recognize us.

612
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,490
怎么  就因为帽子和墨镜吗
What, because of hats and sunglasses?

613
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,200
这不叫伪装  汉克
That's not a disguise, Hank.

614
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,480
我们只是像看棒球赛的自己
We look like ourselves at a baseball game.

615
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,540
在独立系统中
In an isolated system...

616
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:45,290
粒子以稳定相关系共存
particles co-exist in a stable phase relationship.

617
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,470
如果系统受到干扰
If the system is interfered with,

618
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,840
稳定就会变成混乱
that stability becomes chaos.

619
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,390
不可预测
Unpredictable.

620
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,170
危险  美妙
Dangerous. Beautiful.

621
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,910
完全独立的量子系统
Isolated completely, a quantum system

622
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,560
将退回到物质的不同状态
would revert back to separate states of matter...

623
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,370
每一个都与其环境的独特状态纠缠
each entangled with a distinct state of its environment.

624
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,650
也就是说
In other words,

625
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,860
这一物体将同时与多个平行现实
the object in question would be both in and out of phase

626
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,330
同相和异相
with multiple parallel realities.

627
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,970
说到跟现实不同步
Speaking of being out of phase with reality.

628
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,320
我注意到你们之中
I am noticing an unusually high number

629
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,760
有异常多的朦胧目光
of glazed eyes out there among you.

630
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,810
我们就提前几分钟结束吧
So, why don't we call it a few minutes early?

631
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,040
今天就到这儿吧
That'll be enough for today.

632
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,050
谢谢  女士们先生们  你们可以走了
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, you may go.

633
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,130
真是难以置信  你与珍妮特相连
It's incredible. You're linked to Janet.

634
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,950
这是你脑中波斯纳分子的各量子态
It's quantum entanglement between the quantum states of

635
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,840
之间的量子纠缠
Posner molecules in your brains.

636
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,390
嗯  我也那么想的
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

637
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,850
你们是把"量子"一词加在每句话之前吗
Do you guys just put the word "quantum" in front of everything?

638
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,580
博士  我们得找到我们的实验室
Doctor, we need to find our lab.

639
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,600
霍普  我也想帮你
Hope, I'd love to help you...

640
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,440
但我并没有你说的那样的设备
but I don't have anything like the equipment you're describing.

641
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,960
我就说这是浪费时间  我们走吧
I told you this is a waste of time. Come on, let's go.

642
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,410
别瞧不起我  汉克
Don't condescend, Hank.

643
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,360
是你在躲避联调局的追捕
You're the one who's on the run from the FBI.

644
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,320
就因为你非得把自己放大到
All because you had to grow to a size

645
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,360
与你的自大相配的尺寸
that finally fit your ego.

646
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,550
德国那个不是我  是这个白痴
That wasn't me in Germany. It was this idiot.

647
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:06,980
真的
Really?

648
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,160
变那么大肯定很累吧
Going that big, it must've been exhausting.

649
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,890
我之后整整睡了三天  你都无法想象
I slept for three days straight. You have no idea.

650
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,020
我能想象
Actually, I do.

651
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,830
想当年  我曾跟汉克搭档搞过一个项目
Back in the day, I was Hank's partner on a project called

652
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,660
歌利亚[巨人]
Goliath.

653
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,380
等等  你是我的搭档吗
Excuse me? You were my partner?

654
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,690
唯一比变那么大还累的
The only thing more tiring than going that big

655
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,610
就是忍受汉克的臭脾气
is putting up with Hank's bullshit.

656
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,580
是啊
Right...

657
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,630
我不知道
I don't know.

658
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,400
你变得多大
How big did you get?

659
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,780
最高纪录是21英尺
My record? 21 feet.

660
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,180
-不赖啊  -你呢
- Not bad. - You?

661
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,680
算了
I don't...

662
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,110
不  真的  我很好奇
No, really, I'm curious.

663
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,730
65英尺  是啊
65 feet. Yeah.

664
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:39,980
-好大啊  -65英尺
- Huge. - 65.

665
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,500
如果你们俩比够大小了
If you two are finished comparing sizes...

666
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,520
我们得想办法追踪实验室
we need to figure out a way to track down the lab.

667
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,600
伟大的汉克·皮姆还没想到办法吗
And the great Hank Pym hasn't figured that one out yet?

668
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,570
奇怪啊
Strange.

669
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,030
你想当年可是无所不知
You had all the answers back in the day.

670
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,590
所以我才离开了项目
That's why I left the project.

671
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,570
离开吗
Left?

672
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,140
-是我炒了你  -我最正确的决定
- I fired you. - Best decision I ever made.

673
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,360
汉克是个糟糕的搭档  脾气暴躁
Hank was a terrible partner. Temperamental...

674
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,190
固执  没耐心
stubborn, impatient.

675
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,660
他迟早会把所有人都推开
Sooner or later, he just pushed everyone away.

676
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,970
只是那些庸才
Just the mediocrities.

677
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,590
珍妮特是唯一受得了他
Janet was the only one who could endure him

678
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,790
并选择留下来的
and chose to stick it out.

679
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,630
小心点  比尔
Watch it, Bill.

680
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,420
但她为此付出了代价  是吧
She paid the price, though, didn't she?

681
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,430
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch.

682
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,730
我不是来这儿听你俩吵嘴的
I didn't come here to listen to you two squabble.

683
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,700
我想救我妈妈
I'm trying to save my mother.

684
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,730
你说是哪个办公室
Now, which office would you say?

685
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:20,830
是吴
Oh, it's Woo.

686
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,860
肯定是有人看见了我
Someone must have seen me.

687
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,140
放松  如果是因为你
Relax. If this is about you,

688
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,000
他们早该赶到你家了
they'd be in your house by now.

689
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,320
你是15岁小孩吗
What are you, 15?

690
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,620
快点  我们得马上走了
Come on. We gotta go right now.

691
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,810
等等  你们或许能制造个临时追踪器
Wait. You might be able to improvise that tracker...

692
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,190
只需要修改你调节器的衍射组件
if you modify the diffraction units on one of your regulators.

693
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,540
-这可行  -我都不知道那是什么意思
- That could work. - I don't know what that means.

694
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,850
谢谢  谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

695
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,010
但是  博士
But, Doctor,

696
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,370
校警说他们发现了皮姆和凡·戴恩
campus police says they ID'd both Pym and Van Dyne.

697
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,630
我不知道该怎么说  探员
I don't know what to tell you, Agent.

698
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,830
我都30年没跟汉克说过话了
I haven't talked to Hank in 30 years.

699
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,480
我向你保证
I can assure you

700
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,160
我是他最不会想见的人了
I'm the last person he would want to visit.

701
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,340
得了  你指望我们...
Oh, come on, you expect us to...

702
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:05,860
为什么
Why is that?

703
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:09,010
简单  我们恨死彼此了
Simple. We hate each other's guts.

704
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,660
我是糟糕的搭档
So I'm a terrible partner?

705
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:14,090
福斯特  在他平庸的职业生涯中
Foster, he hasn't had one good idea

706
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,260
就没想出过一个好点子
in his unremarkable career.

707
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,310
但他关于衍射器的点子可行  是吧
But his idea about the diffractors could work, right?

708
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,350
好吧  一个好点子
Fine, one decent idea.

709
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,350
但我升级战衣时
Except, I eliminated the diffractors

710
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,170
去掉了衍射器
when I upgraded the suits.

711
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,070
所以  如果我们有旧战衣
So, if we had an old suit,

712
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,430
我们或许就能追踪到实验室了
we might be able to track down the lab?

713
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,930
是的  但我们没有
Yes, but we don't.

714
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,150
-如果我们有呢  -你什么意思
- What if we did? - What do you mean?

715
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,050
我是说...
I mean...

716
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:40,610
人生很奇妙
life's funny.

717
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,320
天呐  你没销毁战衣
Oh, my God. You didn't destroy the suit.

718
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:43,950
什么
What?

719
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,910
那是你毕生的心血  汉克
Well, it was your life's work, Hank.

720
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,790
我不能销毁它
I couldn't destroy that.

721
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:49,730
我自首之前
Before I turned myself in,

722
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,670
我把它缩小然后邮给了路易斯
I shrunk it down and mailed it to Luis.

723
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,130
你把我的战衣邮寄了出去
You sent my suit through the mail?

724
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,610
邮政服务是非常可靠的
Hey, the postal service is very reliable.

725
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,860
现在有追踪码了  像快递服务一样
You know, they do tracking numbers now. Like UPS.

726
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:00,830
它在哪
Where is it?

727
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,530
在一个非常安全的地方  别担心
It's in a very safe place, all right? Don't worry.

728
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:06,310
奖杯吗  不在了
What, the trophy? No, it's not here.

729
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,910
什么叫不在了  还能在哪
What do you mean it's not there? Where could it be?

730
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,430
我到处看了  不在
I looked everywhere. It's not here.

731
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,070
别动那盆花
Hey, get away from the plant.

732
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,050
但我跟凯西玩过后  我放回...
But I put it back after Cassie and I...

733
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,080
展示说明
Show-and-tell.

734
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,530
斯科特
Scotty?

735
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,100
不  别
No, stop!

736
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:22,510
好消息是  我知道它在哪
Well, the good news is I know where it is.

737
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,190
不是说回到学校时
Whenever you go back to school

738
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,340
会觉得一切都变小了吗
isn't everything supposed to look so much smaller?

739
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,820
这地方看上去好大
This place seems huge.

740
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,130
怎么了
What is it?

741
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,360
是新调节器
It's the new regulator.

742
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,020
汉克  这件战衣怎么回事
Hank, what's going on with this suit?

743
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,110
到底是多"还没完成"
How much of a work in progress is this?

744
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,630
不不不
No, no, no.

745
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,720
你笑什么  拜托  你能不能
What are you, laughing? Please, could you just...

746
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,890
好啦
Okay, okay.

747
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,110
怎么样
What do you see?

748
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,250
尺寸线圈故障了
The sizing coils are malfunctioning.

749
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,140
让我...
Just let me...

750
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,630
-抱歉  -没事的
- Sorry. - It's all right.

751
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:16,950
好吧
Okay.

752
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:18,550
好了
All right.

753
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,940
现在试试
Try that.

754
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,190
抱歉
Sorry.

755
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,300
什么
What?

756
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,470
好啊
Awesome.

757
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,450
真希望美队现在能看到你
If only Cap could see you now.

758
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,710
好笑死了  我们怎么办
Hilarious. What are we gonna do?

759
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,330
你有通行证吗
Where's your hall pass?

760
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,760
我问你呢
Hey, I'm talking to you.

761
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,530
你可以的
You can do it.

762
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,920
马上够到了
You almost got it.

763
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,390
小花生
Oh, peanut.

764
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,020
好了  我们走
Okay, let's go.

765
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,160
好啊  小伙儿  今天在学校过得如何
Hiya, champ, how was school today?

766
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,800
好了  有笑话赶紧说完
All right, get your jokes out now.

767
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,200
能不能把战衣修好
Can you fix the suit?

768
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,460
脾气真坏
So cranky.

769
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,290
要不要来盒果汁和手撕奶酪
You want a juice box and some string cheese?

770
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,890
你真有那个吗
Do you really have that?

771
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,070
看看福斯特说的对不对
Let's see if Foster was right.

772
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,660
这肯定是实验室了
This has gotta be the lab.

773
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,480
我们去拿吧
Let's go get it.

774
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:56,610
好
Yeah.

775
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,190
看上去是这里
This seems right.

776
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,940
看看我们  一天组队两次
Look at us, teaming up twice in one day.

777
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,400
真让人不禁想
Makes you think, huh?

778
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:14,680
想什么
About what?

779
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,830
德国
Germany.

780
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,520
什么意思
What do you mean?

781
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:20,510
我们当时一起工作  一起训练
We were working together, training together...

782
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:23,130
还一起其他的
and other stuffing together.

783
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,550
如果我问了你  你会去吗
If I had asked you, would you have come?

784
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,030
看来我们永远不得而知了
I guess we'll never know.

785
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,790
但我知道一件事
But I do know one thing.

786
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,000
什么
What?

787
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,640
如果我去了  你就不会被抓了
If I had, you'd have never been caught.

788
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,670
斯科特
Scott.

789
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,550
你能不能暂时停止对我女儿做白日梦
You think you can stop daydreaming about my daughter

790
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,210
去把我的实验室拿回来
long enough to get my lab?

791
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:48,010
-是  先生  -谢谢
- Yes, sir. - Thank you.

792
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,260
好了  信号收到
Okay, you're transmitting.

793
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,910
怎么这么慢
What took you so long?

794
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,900
抱歉  我给我的蚂蚁想名字来着
Sorry, I had to come up with a name for my ant.

795
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,750
我想叫他尤利西斯·格兰蚁
I'm thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.

796
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,750
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}尤利西斯·格兰特是第18任美国总统

797
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,220
喜欢吗
You like it?

798
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,280
真好笑
Hilarious.

799
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,210
显示屏上什么都看不到
I'm not getting anything on the monitors.

800
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:09,740
有电子干扰
There's some kind of electronic disturbance.

801
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,670
你们小心
Be careful.

802
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,620
你知道我的  汉克  我一向小心
You know me, Hank. I'm always careful...

803
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,240
没事  只是那套战衣
It's okay. It's just the suit.

804
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,950
-你怎么知道  -看
- How do you know? - Look.

805
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,620
那是幽灵吗
That's Ghost?

806
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,560
她在干什么
What is she doing?

807
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,610
你觉得她是靠战衣穿墙什么的吗
Do you think that suit is how she goes through walls and stuff?

808
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,470
我们趁她还没醒赶紧走吧
Let's just get outta here before she wakes up.

809
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:31,210
霍普  看  实验室
Hope, look! There's the lab.

810
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,690
我们确定这是我们的缩小大楼
Now, we're sure this is our shrunken building

811
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,640
不是别人的吧
and not somebody else's, right?

812
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,950
快去拿  斯科特  我们得动作快点
Just take it, Scott. Come on, we gotta be fast.

813
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,300
我拿
I'll get it.

814
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:46,780
该死
Oh, shit...

815
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,950
霍普  霍普  汉克
Hope. Hope! Hank.

816
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,650
伙计们
Guys.

817
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:06,160
他们应该听不到
I don't think they can hear you.

818
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,040
我是艾娃
I'm Ava.

819
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,600
斯科特
Scott.

820
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,240
看来
So,

821
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,250
你不需要战衣也能
you don't need the suit to...

822
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,490
穿墙
go through things.

823
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:23,500
是啊
No.

824
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,600
它只是帮我控制这种状态
It just helps me control it.

825
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:32,390
本该也能抑制疼痛的
And the pain, supposedly.

826
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,760
你不会把手伸进我的胸膛
You're not gonna reach into my chest

827
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,320
捏爆我的心脏吧
and crush my heart, are you?

828
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:44,930
你真好玩
You're funny.

829
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,260
我不会伤害你的  斯科特  除非逼不得已
I'm not gonna hurt you, Scott, unless I have to.

830
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,280
我需要
I need...

831
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,160
你脑袋里的东西
what's in your head.

832
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,230
我们把其他人叫醒
Let's wake up the rest of the gang

833
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,760
赶紧开始吧  好吗
and get this over with, shall we?

834
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,140
醒醒
Get up!

835
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,080
醒过来
Come on!

836
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:25,290
爸爸
Dad?

837
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,260
你敢再碰他试试
Don't ever touch him again.

838
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:30,930
好了  霍普
Now, now, Hope...

839
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:33,520
我觉得考虑到一切
I think I'm being rather gentle with your father,

840
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,250
我对你父亲算温柔了
all things considered.

841
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,960
你说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

842
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:41,860
汉克·皮姆的自大的另一个牺牲品
Another casualty of Hank Pym's ego.

843
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,070
比尔
Bill.

844
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,970
你做了什么
What have you done?

845
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,340
是你做了什么  皮姆博士
It's what you've done, Dr. Pym.

846
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,640
你跟她一起的
You're with her?

847
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,560
天呐  我以为你挺好呢
Oh, man. I thought you were cool.

848
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,460
到底是怎么回事
What the hell is going on here?

849
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,150
汉克估计没提过我父亲吧
I doubt Hank has ever mentioned my father.

850
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,320
他怎么会呢
Why would he?

851
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:03,900
埃利海斯·斯塔尔
Elihas Starr.

852
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,700
他们曾是神盾局的同事
They were colleagues at S.H.I.E.L.D.

853
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,420
量子研究
Quantum research.

854
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:13,660
直到我父亲胆敢反对伟大的汉克·皮姆
Until my father dare disagree with the great Hank Pym.

855
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,150
你让人开除了他
You had him fired.

856
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,130
还毁掉了他的名誉
Oh, and discredited for good measure.

857
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:24,900
我父亲想自己继续研究
My father tried to continue his research on his own.

858
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:29,260
为了恢复名誉  他不惜冒险
Desperate to restore his name, so he took risks.

859
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,440
不不
No, no, no!

860
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,400
太冒险了
Too many.

861
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,990
直到出了岔子
Until something went wrong.

862
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,860
他叫我们跑
He told us to run.

863
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,030
埃利海斯  怎么回事
Elihas, what's happening?

864
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,960
快跑吧  跑啊
Just go. Go!

865
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:42,750
爸爸  爸爸
Daddy! Daddy!

866
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,480
我看得出他很怕
I could tell he was scared.

867
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:50,910
爸爸
Daddy!

868
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,980
艾娃  不要
Ava, no!

869
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:57,070
我不想留下他一个人
I didn't want him to be alone.

870
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,520
不要啊
No! No!

871
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,940
不要
No!

872
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:09,910
我醒来时  我父母都死了
When I woke up, my parents were dead.

873
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:14,180
我就没那么幸运了
I wasn't so lucky.

874
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,410
他们称之为"分子失调"
They call it "molecular disequilibrium."

875
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:25,270
这名字挺蠢的
A rather dull name, I think.

876
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,500
并不能描述它的可怕
Doesn't quite do justice to what it means.

877
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:32,700
我身体里的每一个细胞都被撕碎
Every cell in my body is torn apart

878
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,680
然后又被组了回去
and stitched back together.

879
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,980
一遍又一遍
Over and over.

880
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,260
日复一日
Every day.

881
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:42,590
我当时还在神盾局  接到电话说
I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D. when I got the call about a

882
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,120
阿根廷发生了量子异常
quantum anomaly in Argentina.

883
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,300
你好  艾娃
Hello, Ava.

884
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:51,460
我叫比尔
My name's Bill.

885
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:54,320
我曾是你父亲的朋友
I was a friend of your father's.

886
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,830
我给你带了礼物
I brought you something.

887
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,950
没事  再试一次
It's all right. Try again.

888
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:06,780
这就对了
That's it.

889
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:09,970
福斯特博士尽力保护我了
Dr. Foster did his best to keep me safe.

890
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:12,230
但神盾局的其他人
But others at S.H.I.E.L.D.

891
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,840
把我的病症视为机会
saw an opportunity in my affliction.

892
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,960
他们给我造了件控制衣
They built me a containment suit,

893
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,890
让我控制变相
so I could control my phasing.

894
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,960
还训练我成为潜行特工
And trained me to be a stealth operative.

895
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:26,800
他们把我变成了武器
They weaponized me.

896
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:30,120
我为他们偷盗  刺探
I stole for them. Spied for them.

897
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:31,960
杀戮
I killed for them.

898
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,260
我出卖灵魂的代价
And in exchange for my soul

899
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,320
是他们会治好我
they were going to cure me.

900
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:41,580
他们撒了谎
They lied.

901
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,720
神盾局陨落后  我收留了艾娃
When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed, I took Ava in.

902
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,490
我建造了这个舱来减缓她的衰退
I built the chamber to slow her decay,

903
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,500
但她的病情在加剧
but her condition was progressive.

904
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,150
我不知该如何治好她
I didn't know how to cure it.

905
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,080
她想杀你的  汉克  但我阻止了她
She wanted to kill you, Hank, but I told her no

906
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:56,500
而是叫她观察你
and that she should watch you instead.

907
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:57,350
不出所料
And sure enough,

908
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,540
她发现你在建隧道
she discovered that you were building the tunnel.

909
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,630
然后她又跟我讲了朗
Then, she told me about Lang.

910
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,310
以及珍妮特留在他脑袋里的信息
And the message from Janet inside his head,

911
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,450
于是我...
that's when I...

912
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:08,690
老天爷啊
Christ's sake!

913
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:09,990
是我的  抱歉
That's me. I'm sorry.

914
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,870
能告诉我是谁在给我发短信吗
Look, can you tell me who's texting me?

915
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:14,710
凯西  911
"Cassie, 911."

916
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,660
那是我女儿  我得给她回短信
That's my daughter. I need to text her back.

917
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,170
不  别想
No, that's not happening.

918
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:20,310
911就是紧急事件
What, it's 911. That means it's an emergency.

919
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:22,150
你没资格提要求  朗
You're not making demands here, Lang.

920
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,280
你不懂事态多么严...
You're not appreciating the gravity of the...

921
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,920
好吧  她在给我打视频电话了
Okay, look, she's trying to video chat me now.

922
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,760
可能真出事了  让我跟她说话  拜托了
Something might be wrong. Let me talk to her. Please.

923
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,440
凯西  你没事吧  什么急事
Cassie, are you okay? What's the emergency?

924
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,380
我找不到我的足球鞋了
I can't find my soccer shoes.

925
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,130
什么
What?

926
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,460
我明天还有比赛呢
I have a game tomorrow.

927
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:39,810
斯科特  我知道鞋就在那边
Hey, Scott, I know that they're there.

928
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:41,170
你能拿手机在家里走一圈吗
Can you just walk the phone around the house?

929
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:42,750
我现在不行啊
No, I can't do that right now.

930
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,720
-怎么了  -我病了
- Why not? - Because I'm sick.

931
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,560
你能不能稍后找找
Hey, can you just maybe look around later then

932
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,470
再打给我
and call me back?

933
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:48,600
拜托  谢谢
Please? Thank you.

934
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,040
再见  爸爸
Bye, Daddy!

935
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:51,680
-再见  小花生  -早日康复
- Bye, peanut! - Feel better!

936
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,260
早日康复  哥们
Feel better, buddy!

937
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:55,400
对不起  她说急事的
I'm sorry. It said emergency.

938
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,940
艾娃  我想帮你
Ava, I want to help you.

939
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,020
她不需要你的帮助  我知道怎么救她
She doesn't need your help. I know how to save her.

940
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:01,620
是吗  怎么救
Oh, really? How?

941
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:02,290
珍妮特
Janet.

942
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,400
她这30年来
For the last 30 years,

943
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,520
都在量子域吸收量子能
she's been down there absorbing quantum energy.

944
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,860
我们可以提取那能量
We can extract that energy.

945
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,340
用它来修复艾娃的分子结构
We can use it to repair Ava's molecular structure...

946
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,010
提取
Extract it?

947
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:11,760
-是的  -你疯了吗
- Yes. - Are you insane?

948
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,110
那会把珍妮特撕裂的
That would rip Janet apart.

949
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,280
这你不能确定
You don't know that.

950
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,350
我要开启隧道
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

951
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,390
等珍妮特的位置出现在朗脑子里
When Janet's location pops into Lang's head,

952
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:19,240
他就得告诉我
he's gonna give it to me

953
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,250
否则我就把他交给联调局
or I'm gonna turn him over to the FBI.

954
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,160
什么
What?

955
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,960
你给我留在这里
You are gonna stay here

956
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,850
以防我需要你帮忙
just in case I need your help.

957
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,470
我才不会帮你
Like hell I would help you!

958
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:29,820
我怎么说你就得怎么做
You'll do whatever I say.

959
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,630
你会害死珍妮特的
You're gonna kill Janet!

960
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:32,930
你还是多担心自己吧  汉克
I'd be more worried about yourself, Hank.

961
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:34,340
该死  比尔
Goddamn it, Bill!

962
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,670
-爸爸  -冷静  汉克
- Dad? - Calm down, Hank.

963
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:39,490
老天啊
So help me God...

964
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:41,030
药
The pills.

965
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:42,750
他的心脏  他需要吃药
It's his heart! He needs his pills.

966
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:43,860
求你  福斯特博士
Please, Dr. Foster.

967
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,490
药就在铁盒里  拜托了
They're in the tin. Please.

968
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,410
他会死的  拜托
He could die! Come on!

969
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:50,570
帮他啊
Help him!

970
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,310
爸爸  撑住了
Dad, just hang on, all right?

971
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:53,660
继续呼吸  冷静点
Just keep breathing. Stay calm.

972
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,220
帮他啊  快点
Help him, man! Come on!

973
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,580
那个薄荷糖盒
The Altoid tin!

974
00:49:59,150 --> 00:49:59,840
等等
Wait!

975
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:04,750
谢谢了  伙计们
Thanks, guys.

976
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:06,400
汉克
Hank!

977
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,900
比尔给那姑娘灌输了一脑子的谎言
Bill is filling that girl's head with lies.

978
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,840
埃利海斯·斯塔尔是个叛徒
Elihas Starr was a traitor.

979
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,760
他偷了我的图纸
He stole my plans.

980
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,110
往下点  锁定
Now, bring it down. All right, lock it in.

981
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:30,010
不不  螺栓在另一边
No, no, no. The bolt is on the other side.

982
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:32,970
把那个锁紧  往下拉一点
Tighten that one down, then bring it down one notch.

983
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:34,050
好样的
Good job.

984
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,140
会成功的
It'll work.

985
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,580
福斯特  要是他做  会烧毁系统的
Foster, he could have fried the entire system.

986
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,700
我们调整继电器
Look, we'll adjust the relays

987
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,690
你去重编程设置
while you go reprogram the settings, all right?

988
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:41,810
会成功的
It's going to be fine.

989
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:49,170
关键时刻到了
So, this is it.

990
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:51,710
是啊  按说筹备了这么久
Yeah. You'd think with all this time to prepare

991
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:52,730
我该准备好了
I'd be more ready.

992
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:55,680
你是没法为进入亚原子状态做好准备的
Oh, going subatomic isn't something you can prepare for.

993
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,890
那会模糊你的意识
It kind of melts your mind.

994
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,430
我是指再见到我妈妈
I mean seeing my mom again.

995
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,870
如果她完全变成了另一个人呢
What if she's a completely different person?

996
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,550
是啊  比如变成了乔治·华盛顿
Yeah, like, uh, George Washington.

997
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:09,880
我说真的  斯科特
I'm serious, Scott.

998
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,080
或是乔治·杰斐逊
Or George Jefferson.

999
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,140
如果她已经忘记了我呢
What if she's forgotten about me?

1000
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,710
我在监狱时
When I was in prison...

1001
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,700
唯一帮我度过那段时光的就是凯西
the only thing that got me through was Cassie.

1002
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,750
我哪怕被关个100年
I could have been locked up for 100 years...

1003
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,380
也绝不会忘记她
I never would have forgotten her.

1004
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:29,300
我知道你妈妈肯定时刻
I know your mom is counting the minutes

1005
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,690
都盼着与你团聚
until she can see you again.

1006
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:33,960
谢谢
Thank you.

1007
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,520
我们有大麻烦了
We got a big problem.

1008
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,030
你忘记大楼后面的
You forgot the motion sensor lights

1009
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:46,200
运动传感器灯了
on the back of the building.

1010
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,590
糟糕
Oh, no.

1011
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:49,160
提议案里有
And they're on the proposal,

1012
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,990
卡拉佩特安还特地问到了
and Karapetyan asked for them specifically.

1013
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:54,170
是啊  我们忙得挺疯的
Uh, yeah, look, it's been a little crazy.

1014
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,220
这样吧  我明天过去  看一眼
Look, maybe I could stop by tomorrow, take a look at it.

1015
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:58,260
不行
No. No, no, no, no.

1016
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,500
明天一大早就要见面了
The meeting is first thing in the morning.

1017
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,090
你得马上过来解决它
You gotta come right now and fix it.

1018
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:03,460
我不能  我也想  但我不能走
I can't. I wish I could, but I can't leave.

1019
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:04,510
这样  我去找你
You know what, I'm coming to you.

1020
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:06,970
我带图纸过去  就在笔记本电脑上
I'll just bring the plans. They're on the laptop.

1021
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:08,110
你在那里修改
And you can fix them there.

1022
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:09,940
告诉我你在哪里
Just tell me where you are, okay?

1023
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:10,950
一言难尽
It's complicated.

1024
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:12,410
什么意思  一言难尽
What do you mean it's complicated?

1025
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,250
如您所见  先生
As you can see, sir,

1026
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,740
这套系统是最先进的
this system is state of the art.

1027
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,980
明日的安保系统  今日享用
Security of tomorrow, today.

1028
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,000
太棒了
Oh, that's so good!

1029
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,990
我喜欢你的探身  继续练习
And I love the lean-in, bro. Keep practicin'.

1030
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,100
我得开车去斯科特那里
Hey, I just gotta drive up to Scotty's,

1031
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,310
我们好修改图纸
so we can fix the plans.

1032
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:29,900
别担心  我回来时肯定还有时间
But don't worry, I'll be back in plenty of time.

1033
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,610
如您所见
As you can see...

1034
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,630
你们为明早把货车洗干净了吧
Tell me you got the van washed for tomorrow morning.

1035
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:36,150
底盘都洗了
Down to the undercarriage, baby.

1036
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:37,940
你还要了洗底盘
You sprung for the undercarriage wash?

1037
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,200
你叫我全洗的
Well, you said get the works.

1038
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:39,840
那是骗人的  哥们
That's a scam, bro.

1039
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,540
我们住在加州  又不是明尼苏达州
We live in California, not Minnesota.

1040
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,550
他说得对
He's right.

1041
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,110
洗底盘
The undercarriage wash,

1042
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,400
是为了洗掉除冰盐
that's for cleaning off road salt

1043
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,110
我们更爱下雪的姐妹州的道路上才会撒那个
laid down in our more snow-laden sister states.

1044
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,870
你是谁  你怎么会这么清楚洗车行业的规矩
Who are you, and why do you know so much about car wash protocol?

1045
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:55,470
我叫桑尼·伯奇
Well, my name is Sonny Burch.

1046
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:58,380
我很会做调查  路易斯
And I do my research, Luis.

1047
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:04,190
我还从一个联调局的朋友那里得知
To wit, I have learned from a friend of mine at the FBI

1048
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:06,620
你跟斯科特·朗相熟
that you are a known associate of Scott Lang...

1049
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,930
斯科特和汉克·皮姆相熟  我还知道
a known associate of Hank Pym, who I've also learned

1050
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:12,100
汉克有个便携可缩小实验室
has a portable shrinking laboratory

1051
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:14,480
里面有各式各样有趣的科技
filled with all kinds of juicy tech.

1052
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,190
你得告诉我  它在哪
And you're gonna tell me where it is.

1053
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,660
我真不想告诉你
Well, I hate to break it to you, but

1054
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:20,950
但我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

1055
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,680
你好像有点抵触  路易斯
Well, I sense a resistance in you, Luis.

1056
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:28,030
但我答应了某些危险人物给他们问出结果
And I have promised results to some dangerous people.

1057
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:32,150
所以  给你介绍一下我的好友  乌兹曼
So, I'm gonna introduce you to my good friend, Uzman.

1058
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:35,900
乌兹曼特别擅长
Now... Uzman is a master

1059
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:37,410
通过精神手段
at extracting information

1060
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:40,500
撬开不愿开口的人的嘴
from the unwilling through psychoactive means.

1061
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:43,540
那是吐真剂吗
Oh, is that truth serum?

1062
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,990
不存在吐真剂这种东西
There's no such thing as truth serum.

1063
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,950
那就是电视节目的鬼扯
That's just nonsense from TV.

1064
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,240
那它是什么
Well, what is it then?

1065
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,840
这是一种混合药剂
It's a little concoction

1066
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,900
从他当年还在MI6时  就一直在改良
that he's been perfecting since his days with the S.I.S.

1067
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:56,920
它会让你极容易受到暗示  有问必答
It makes you suggestible and highly responsive.

1068
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,100
哥们  那就是吐真剂
Well, dude, that's truth serum.

1069
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,080
不是的
No, it's not.

1070
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,170
无意冒犯  但是我觉得那就是吐真剂
No offensing, but they sound like truth serum to me.

1071
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:04,320
-是吧  -它不是吐真剂
- Right? - It's not a truth serum.

1072
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,840
好吧  我相信你
Okay. Hey, I believe you.

1073
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,490
不是吐真剂
It's not a truth serum.

1074
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:10,880
如果它看起来像吐真剂  功能也是吐真
I mean, if it walk like duck and talk like ducks...

1075
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:11,930
那它就是吐真剂
The truth serum.

1076
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:13,440
我过敏的东西可多了
Well, I have a lot of allergies...

1077
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,660
请你三思
so you might wanna think about that.

1078
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,390
我们得夺回实验室
We've got to get that lab back.

1079
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:22,460
怎么了
What?

1080
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,170
舱和战衣几乎无法帮你控制病情了
The chamber and the suit are barely helping anymore.

1081
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,910
我还能活多久
How long have I got?

1082
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,210
几周吧
A couple of weeks, maybe.

1083
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:38,500
那我们逼他们把实验室拿回来
Well, then we'll make them bring the lab back.

1084
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:39,650
怎么做
How?

1085
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:43,390
朗  他有个女儿  对吧
Lang. He has a daughter, right?

1086
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:44,620
你不是真想这么干吧
You can't mean that.

1087
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,680
艾娃
Ava!

1088
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:50,100
你在外面惹的祸  我都忍了
I tolerate a lot of the things you do out there...

1089
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,030
但这种事我绝不参与
but I won't be a part of anything like that.

1090
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,620
在渐渐消失的不是你  比尔
You're not the one who's about to fade away into nothing, Bill.

1091
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:56,650
而是我
I am!

1092
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:58,930
你说你能治好我
You said you could fix me!

1093
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:03,320
你保证过的
You promised.

1094
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:05,390
我知道  我会的
I know. I will.

1095
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,170
但不能那样做
But not like that.

1096
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:11,420
你敢碰那小女孩一下
You lay one finger on that little girl...

1097
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,410
我就不帮你了  我们分道扬镳
I won't help you. And we're done.

1098
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,080
好吧
Fine.

1099
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:24,330
还有其他选择
There are other options.

1100
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,990
你知道吗  你说得对  这不是吐真剂
You know what? You're right. This isn't truth serum.

1101
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:42,200
因为我一点感觉都没有
Because I don't feel anything.

1102
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,950
我撒谎了  我有感觉
That was a lie. I do feel something.

1103
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,300
这就是吐真剂
This is truth serum!

1104
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,480
吐真剂是不存在的
There's no such thing!

1105
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,420
好了
Okay.

1106
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:49,630
好了  好了
Okay, okay.

1107
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:53,090
很简单  路易斯
Now, I'm gonna make this real easy for you, Luis.

1108
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,030
好
Okay.

1109
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:59,530
斯科特·朗在哪
Where is Scott Lang?

1110
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,270
这事说来话长
Well, see, that's complicated.

1111
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,310
我第一次遇见斯科特时  他糟透了
Because when I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place.

1112
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:04,850
而且我不是指牢房D区
And I'm not talkin' about cell block D.

1113
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:06,700
他妻子刚刚申请离婚  我说
His wife had just filed for divorce, and I was, like...

1114
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,580
"该死  哥们  她在你蹲号子时甩了你"
"Damn, homie. She dumped you when you're on lockup?"

1115
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:09,260
他说"是啊  我知道
And he was, like, "Yeah, I know.

1116
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,770
我以为我能跟她白头偕老呢
"I thought I was gonna be with her forever...

1117
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:11,660
结果现在我孤身一人"
"But now I'm all alone."

1118
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,740
我说"哥们  你知道吗
And I was, like, "Damn, homie. You know what?

1119
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,440
振作点  你有新搭档了
"You gotta chin up, because you'll find a new partner.

1120
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,790
你知道吗  我是路易斯"
"But you know what? I'm Luis."

1121
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,160
他说"你知道吗  我是斯科特
And he says, "You know what? I'm Scotty,

1122
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:17,870
我们会成为铁哥们的"
"And we're gonna be best friends."

1123
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:19,180
打住  打住
Okay, hold on, hold on.

1124
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:21,000
我很喜欢听精彩的故事
I like a good story as much as the next person...

1125
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,020
但是  这些跟斯科特·朗在哪
but what in the hell does this have to do

1126
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,000
有什么关系
with where Scott Lang is?

1127
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,380
我快讲到了  就快讲到了
I'm getting there. I'm getting there.

1128
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,320
你投了币  就得听完整首歌
You put a dime in him, you gotta let the whole song play out.

1129
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,170
他就像人形点唱机
He like human jukebox.

1130
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:31,080
我奶奶开的餐厅里有台点唱机
Oh, my abuelita had a jukebox in the restaurant!

1131
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,730
是啊  只放莫里西的歌
Yeah, only played Morrissey.

1132
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,490
要是有人抱怨  她就...
And if anybody ever complained, she'd be like...

1133
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,650
墨西哥裔  我们喊他们墨兹
You know, Chicanos, we call him "Moz."

1134
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:38,700
然后她就说"不送"
Then, ¡adios!

1135
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,620
没办法  他忧郁的情歌让我们很有共鸣
What can I say? We relate to his melancholy ballads, you know?

1136
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,250
-朗  -好好好
- Lang! - Right, right, right.

1137
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:44,610
后来  斯科特出狱了
So, anyway, Scotty gets out of jail,

1138
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:45,300
他开始为汉克工作
and he starts working for Hank.

1139
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:47,080
这时他遇到了霍普  霍普却一副
That's when he met Hope. And Hope's all, like...

1140
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,020
"我不想跟你扯上关系
"I want nothing to do with you.

1141
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,620
看看我的发型  我超正经"的样子
"Look at my hairdo, I'm all business."

1142
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:50,640
斯科特就说
And then Scotty's, like,

1143
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,210
知道吗  妹子  我的心已碎
"You know what, girl? My heart is all broken.

1144
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:53,390
我可能再也不会爱了
"And I'll probably never find love again,

1145
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:54,610
但我可真想吻你
"But damn if I want to kiss you!"

1146
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:55,350
时间快进
But then you fast forward

1147
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,820
他们就爱上彼此了
and they're all into each other, right?

1148
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,680
然后斯科特说
And then Scotty's, like,

1149
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,120
知道吗  我不能告诉你
"You know what? I can't tell you this...

1150
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,080
但我要去跟美国队长砸烂一座机场
"But I'm gonna go trash an airport with Captain America."

1151
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,050
然后她说  真不敢相信你就那么跑了
And then she said, "I can't believe you split like that!

1152
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,390
回见了  蠢蛋
"Smell you later, dummy."

1153
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,810
于是斯科特就被软禁了
So, Scotty goes on house arrest.

1154
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:07,600
他不肯承认  但他心里觉得
And he won't admit it, but his heart is all, like...

1155
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,860
该死  我还以为霍普可以成为
"Damn! I thought Hope coulda been

1156
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,840
我的新真搭档呢  但我搞砸了
"My new true partner, but I blew it!"

1157
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,040
但命运让他们又走到了一起
But fate brought 'em back together.

1158
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,190
然后霍普心里就想
And then Hope's heart is all...

1159
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:14,860
我担心我不能信任他
"I'm worried that I can't trust him...

1160
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,480
他会再次搞砸  毁掉一切
"And he's gonna screw up again, and ruin everything!"

1161
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,000
然后我心里就想
And then my heart is all, like...

1162
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,130
那高档覆盆子点心代表了公司的负债
"That fancy raspberry filling represents the company's red

1163
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:21,860
我们只差几天就要倒闭了
"And we're days away from going out of business. "

1164
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:22,790
倒闭
"Out of business"?

1165
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:23,720
只差几天
"Days away"?

1166
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:24,790
该死的吐真剂
Damn truth serum!

1167
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:27,200
我其实是想保护你们的  我发誓
I was trying to protect you guys. I swear to God.

1168
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,230
我是想做个好老板的  但我们破产了
I was trying to be a good boss, but we're broke!

1169
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:30,170
卡拉佩特安是我们最后的希望
And the Karapetyan's our last hope.

1170
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:31,380
如果我们不去  我们就完了
And if we don't show up, we're done!

1171
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:32,640
这叫什么好老板
That's terrible bossing!

1172
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,260
该死  哥们
Damn, bro!

1173
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,690
这怪我  这怪我
That's on me! That's on me!

1174
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,640
够了
Enough.

1175
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:41,490
我要再问你一次
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

1176
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:44,150
斯科特·朗在哪
Where is Scott Lang?

1177
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:45,050
我这不说呢吗
I've been trying to tell you,

1178
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:46,370
他现在处境尴尬  从情感上说
he's in a tricky spot, emotionally speaking.

1179
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:47,630
从情感上说
Emotionally speaking.

1180
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:51,380
那斯科特·朗  人在哪里
Well, where is Scott Lang, literally speaking!

1181
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:52,760
森林里
The woods.

1182
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,540
森林里
The woods?

1183
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,940
雅加婆婆
Baba Yaga!

1184
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,190
什么意思  "森林里"
What do you mean, "The woods"?

1185
00:57:58,190 --> 00:57:58,970
缪尔森林
The Muir Woods,

1186
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:00,820
全景高速的第二条消防道路上
the second fire road off the Panoramic Highway!

1187
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,100
老天爷啊
For God's sake!

1188
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:05,950
雅加婆婆  晚上到来
Baba Yaga, come at night

1189
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:08,230
小娃娃们  好好睡
Little children, sleepy tight

1190
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:12,400
该死的
Damn it!

1191
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,120
如果那怪物拿到皮姆的设备
If that freak gets Pym's tech...

1192
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:16,430
我就再别想找回来了
I'm never gonna see it.

1193
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,390
我们怎么办
So, what do we do now?

1194
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:20,940
从联调局那里偷
It's easier to steal it from the Feds

1195
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,270
比从妖怪那里偷要简单
than from the boogeyman.

1196
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,540
是我  你想升个职吗
Hey, it's me. How'd you like to get a promotion?

1197
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:31,480
我知道皮姆  凡·戴恩和朗在哪
I got the location on Pym, Van Dyne and Lang.

1198
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,160
但你得马上去抓到他们
But you gonna have to take 'em down now,

1199
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,680
因为他们不会在那里待很久的
because they ain't gonna be there for long.

1200
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,250
等你抓到他们  你要把实验室给我
And when you do, you gonna get me that lab.

1201
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:38,960
知道了
Understood.

1202
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,100
好消息  先生们
Good news, gentlemen.

1203
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,480
联调局会替我们完成累活儿
Feds are gonna do the hard work for us.

1204
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,380
看什么呢  给我换胎
What are you lookin' at? Change my tires!

1205
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,010
好
Right.

1206
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,770
-先生  -不知道敲门吗
- Sir. - Can you knock?

1207
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:56,200
抱歉  先生  我收到条线索
Sorry, sir. Uh, but I just got a lead.

1208
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:58,650
我喜欢线索
I love leads.

1209
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,200
系统已就绪
System's in the green.

1210
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:08,830
线圈充电
Priming the coils.

1211
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,480
满电
Full charge.

1212
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,490
等隧道打开
As soon as the tunnel's open

1213
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:14,480
一旦你收到任何疑似是
let us know if you get anything

1214
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,870
她的信息  都告诉我们
that could be a part of her message.

1215
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:17,090
好的  没问题
Yeah, yeah. I will.

1216
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,280
那好
Okay, then.

1217
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,690
开始了
Here it goes.

1218
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:39,480
我们成功了
We did it!

1219
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:41,830
有反应吗
You got anything?

1220
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:46,090
没有
Nothin'.

1221
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:48,900
等一等  因为可能...
Well, just give it a minute, because it could...

1222
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,270
不
No.

1223
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:53,660
不不不
No, no, no, no!

1224
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:54,320
怎么回事
What's happening?

1225
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,380
要停机了  可能是我们的向量不对
It's shutting down. Maybe our vectors are off.

1226
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,910
我们都算过一百万次了  肯定是对的
We've gone over them a million times, I know they're right!

1227
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:00,040
那还能是因为什么
Then what else could it be?

1228
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,050
我不知道
I don't know!

1229
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:09,430
-斯科特  你干吗  -斯科特  别乱动
- Scott, what are you doing? - Scott, get away from that!

1230
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:10,340
斯科特  你别...
Scott, you can't...

1231
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:12,180
对不起  我不知道我还有多久
I'm sorry, I don't know how much time I have.

1232
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:13,880
我得改好算法
I need to fix the algorithm.

1233
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:17,810
相信我  在下面待了30年
Trust me, after 30 years down here...

1234
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,740
我都想得很清楚了
I've thought about it a lot.

1235
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:25,410
珍妮特
Janet?

1236
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,420
亲爱的
Hi, honey.

1237
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,390
小糖豆
Jellybean.

1238
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,100
妈妈
Mom?

1239
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:39,060
这并不是我所想象的团聚
It's not the reunion I'd imagined.

1240
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,660
太赶了
It's all so rushed.

1241
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,250
你俩做得太棒了
You two have done such great work.

1242
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,260
你们只需要一点点的
You just need a little...

1243
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:46,980
帮助
nudge.

1244
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:04,200
珍妮特  这怎么可能
Janet, how is this possible?

1245
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,350
你放在斯科特脑子里的不是一则信息
It wasn't a message you put in Scott's head.

1246
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:09,710
而是个天线
It was an antenna.

1247
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:10,950
真聪明
Clever girl.

1248
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:13,010
我好为你骄傲
I'm so proud of you.

1249
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:15,660
亲爱的  告诉我们你在哪
Honey, tell us where you are.

1250
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,280
告诉我们怎么找到你
Tell us how to find you.

1251
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,350
不  概率场太复杂了
No, the probability fields are too complex.

1252
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:21,040
所以我才需要跟你对话
That's why I needed to talk to you.

1253
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,460
你得追随我的声音
You have to follow my voice.

1254
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:23,650
当然了
Of course!

1255
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:25,800
就像追踪一通电话
Like tracing a call back to its source!

1256
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:33,740
我在用亚原子频率追踪你的信号
I'm tracking your signal using subatomic frequencies

1257
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,520
范围是1点和9点
between point two and point nine.

1258
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,140
最好缩小到4和6
I'd narrow it to four and six.

1259
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,490
太窄了  可能会错过你
That's too tight. We could miss you.

1260
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:41,220
看看我们  又在吵了
Look at us squabbling again.

1261
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:44,760
好吧  那就3和7
Fine. All right, between three and seven.

1262
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:48,140
我们数十年来第一次吵架  就这么结束了
Our first fight in decades, and it's over just like that.

1263
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:04,560
正中红心
Bullseye.

1264
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:06,110
信号源锁定
Source lock.

1265
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:07,430
是你
It's you.

1266
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:09,800
我们找到了
We got it!

1267
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,940
你们得去这个坐标找我
You have to meet me at these exact coordinates.

1268
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:15,470
在荒原里  越过量子真空
In the wasteland, beyond the quantum void.

1269
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:16,420
那里很危险
It's very dangerous,

1270
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:19,050
尤其是对人类大脑  务必小心
especially on the human mind, so be careful.

1271
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:21,690
时间和时空的规则在这里很不一样
Time and space work very differently down here.

1272
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:23,040
你们只有两小时
You have two hours.

1273
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,030
之后  概率场会变动
After that, the probability fields will shift...

1274
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:25,850
要再过一世纪
and it'll be another century

1275
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:27,650
才能再次这样对齐了
before they align like this again.

1276
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:28,840
我们会找到你的
We'll find you.

1277
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,960
我知道你会的  小糖豆
I know you will, Jellybean.

1278
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:43,830
不
Nope.

1279
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:45,730
没感觉  我完全没感觉
Nothing. I got nothing.

1280
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:46,920
完全感觉不到珍妮特
No sign of Janet.

1281
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,140
这可好
Perfect.

1282
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,750
我们怎么上来的
How did we get up here?

1283
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:57,800
好  首先你会看到好多光
All right, first you're gonna see all kinds of lights...

1284
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,200
然后会变得很颠簸
and it's gonna get really trippy...

1285
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,270
然后会一片漆黑寂静  非常寂静
but then it's gonna turn black and silent. Really silent.

1286
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:03,760
斯科特  我没事的
Scott, I'll be fine.

1287
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,030
我就是说说  因为我去过嘛
I'm just saying because I've been down there.

1288
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:06,430
嗯  你说过了
Yeah, so you've mentioned.

1289
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:11,960
抱歉  我得接一下
Um, sorry. I have to take this.

1290
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,540
哥们  你来不来啊
Hey, man, you coming?

1291
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,460
我不去了  但知道吗  幽灵要去
No, I'm not, but you know what? Ghost is.

1292
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:18,610
知道吗  联调局  他们也知道你们在哪
And you know what? The Feds, they know where you are.

1293
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,280
-什么  -对不起
- What? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1294
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,580
他们给我用了吐真剂
They gave me some truth serum.

1295
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:23,400
然后我突然就开始老实交待
And then all of a sudden I started talkin' all honestly.

1296
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,360
比如  我讨厌你用洗碗机的方式
Like, I hate the way that you load the dishwasher.

1297
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:26,730
我非常讨厌
I hate it, I hate it.

1298
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:27,610
但你得回家了
But you need to go home

1299
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:29,270
因为联调局可能正在赶过去
because the Feds are probably going there now!

1300
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:30,520
对了
And by the way...

1301
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:33,610
谁会把盘子放在最上层啊  就不该放那里
who puts the plates on the top rack? They don't go there!

1302
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:43,890
我觉得自己好混蛋
I feel like such a jerk.

1303
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:46,780
你们会气死的  我们得马上走了
You're gonna be really mad. We gotta go now.

1304
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:47,920
什么
What?

1305
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,290
幽灵和联调局都知道我们在哪了
Ghost knows where we are. So does the FBI.

1306
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:51,040
怎么会
How?

1307
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,160
-我告诉路易斯了  -什么
- I told Luis where we are. - You what?

1308
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:53,910
我叫他过来
I told him to come here

1309
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:55,700
我好帮忙修改卡拉佩特安的提议案
so I could help him with the Karapetyan proposal.

1310
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:56,750
天呐
Oh, my God!

1311
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:59,130
听着  我们必须拿到那个客户
Look, we need to land that account.

1312
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:00,420
否则我们会失业的
Otherwise, we lose the business!

1313
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,710
你们知道前科犯现在找工作多难吗
Do you know hard it is for ex-cons to find work these days?

1314
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:04,040
天呐  斯科特
Jesus, Scott!

1315
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:15,070
关闭孔洞需要90秒
90 seconds to close the aperture!

1316
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:16,960
我们得先给线圈消磁
You have to depolarize the coils first!

1317
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:17,680
我知道
I know!

1318
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,490
我很抱歉  但是
I'm really sorry, but the, um...

1319
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:22,520
联调局要去我家了
FBI is coming to my place so...

1320
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:23,980
我得走了
I have to go.

1321
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:27,490
我能借用下战衣吗
Can I borrow the suit?

1322
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:31,130
回转仪稳定器
Gyroscopic stabilizers.

1323
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,530
启动
Powering on.

1324
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:34,270
我要把战衣借走了
I'm just gonna borrow the suit.

1325
01:04:35,090 --> 01:04:37,090
我会回来的  告诉我你们会去哪
I'll come back. Just tell me where you'll be.

1326
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:38,690
-不必了  -什么
- Don't bother. - What?

1327
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:39,980
我们找到我妈妈后
We'll come and get the suit from you,

1328
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,390
会去找你取回战衣的
as soon as we've found my mom.

1329
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:43,270
-霍普  -斯科特  走吧
- Hope... - Scott, just go!

1330
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:03,010
-斯科特  -爸爸
- Scott? - Daddy?

1331
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:04,070
是我们  哥们
It's us, buddy!

1332
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:06,560
我们来拿凯西的鞋
We're here for Cassie's shoes!

1333
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:08,050
他肯定在休养
He must be resting.

1334
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:10,400
亲爱的  你上楼去你床底下找找吧
Honey, why don't you go upstairs and look under your bed?

1335
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,570
爸爸  你在楼上吗
Daddy, you upstairs?

1336
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:14,780
爸爸
Daddy?

1337
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:17,110
怎么...
What the...

1338
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:21,390
他现在真是脏得像猪
He really lives like a pig these days.

1339
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,350
爸爸
Daddy?

1340
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,160
散开
Spread it out!

1341
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,200
又来
Again?

1342
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,080
你们真不知耻
You people have no shame!

1343
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,700
监控器显示他在浴室
The monitor says that he's in the bathroom.

1344
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:40,980
我才不信
Yeah, I'm not buying it!

1345
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,610
凯西  让他过去
Cassie, let the man get by!

1346
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:47,120
但爸爸病得好厉害
But Daddy's super sick!

1347
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,150
我去瞧瞧看
I'll see about that!

1348
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:50,250
他说他不希望传染别人
He says he doesn't want anyone else to get sick!

1349
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,110
我乐意冒个险  亲爱的
Well, I'll take my chances, sweetie.

1350
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:54,630
他吐了  好多呢
He barfed. Like, a lot.

1351
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:56,050
小姑娘  我是联邦探员
Young lady, I'm a federal agent.

1352
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:57,990
我见过比呕吐物更糟的东西
I've seen worse things than vomit.

1353
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,100
好多好多吗
Like, "a lot" a lot?

1354
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,290
-是啊  -不管了  让开
- Yes! - Forget it, move aside!

1355
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:03,180
不要
No!

1356
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:12,530
-你怎么来了  -斯科特
- What are you doing here? - Scott.

1357
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:16,330
抱歉  我病得很重
I'm sorry, I'm just really sick.

1358
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,050
我说了吧
I told you.

1359
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:19,270
抱歉
Excuse me.

1360
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:21,590
有时就是得吐出来才爽  是吧
Sometimes you gotta just get it out. You know?

1361
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:22,730
抱歉
Sorry.

1362
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:31,500
我去启动车
I'll start the van.

1363
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:33,290
你拿实验室
You get the lab.

1364
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,870
别动  你们被包围了
Freeze! You're surrounded!

1365
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,510
汉克·皮姆
Hank Pym...

1366
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:55,280
霍普·凡·戴恩
Hope Van Dyne...

1367
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:56,800
你们被捕了
you're under arrest.

1368
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,870
这是骚扰
This is harassment!

1369
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:01,070
其实  不是的
Actually, it's not.

1370
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:02,780
联调局什么意思啊
What does the FBI even stand for...

1371
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:05,210
永远骚扰个人吗
"Forever Bothering Individuals"?

1372
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:08,860
-他的监控器没问题吗  -当然了
- His monitor check out? - Of course it does.

1373
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,300
该死
Damn it!

1374
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:12,980
看来我被骗了
Looks like I just got fed a bowl of malarkey.

1375
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,360
我们抓到他们了  先生
We got 'em, sir.

1376
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,980
皮姆和凡·戴恩都已被羁押
Pym and Van Dyne are in custody.

1377
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:18,270
真的吗  太好了
Seriously? Yes!

1378
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,800
抱歉  斯科特
Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.

1379
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,730
他们是你的朋友  这太不体谅了
They're your friends. That's insensitive.

1380
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,280
我太需要赢一局了
I just really needed a win, you know?

1381
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:26,680
好了  我会稍后回来
Anyway, I'll be back later

1382
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,570
正式结束你的刑期
for the official end of your sentence!

1383
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:30,390
抱歉看错你了  哥们
Sorry for misjudging you, pal!

1384
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:32,350
你该为自己感到骄傲
You should feel great about yourself!

1385
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:57,990
-怎么了  -有人受伤
- What is it? - We have a man down.

1386
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,410
皮姆的实验室不见了
And Pym's lab is gone.

1387
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:12,910
谢谢你掩护我
Thanks for covering for me.

1388
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:13,690
不客气
Sure.

1389
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:17,660
那么
So...

1390
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:20,820
你又开始做蚁人多久了
how long have you been Ant-Man again?

1391
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,030
没多久
Not long.

1392
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:28,380
就那么发生了
It just sort of happened.

1393
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,290
很抱歉我隐瞒了你
I'm sorry for lying to you...

1394
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:32,430
很抱歉我赌上了一切
and I'm sorry for risking everything.

1395
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:33,510
爸爸  没事的
Daddy, it's okay.

1396
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:34,540
不是没事
It's not.

1397
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,210
我做了些蠢事
I do some dumb things...

1398
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:39,990
而我最爱的人却为此付出代价
and the people that I love the most pay the price.

1399
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:40,950
主要是你
Mainly you.

1400
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,970
帮助他人不是蠢事
Trying to help people isn't dumb.

1401
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,670
但我几乎每次都搞砸了
I screw it up just about every time.

1402
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,700
或许你是需要有人照应你
So, maybe you just need someone watching your back,

1403
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:52,380
比如找个搭档
like a partner.

1404
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:55,060
她说得很清楚  那是她最不想做的事了
Well, she's made it clear that's about the last thing she wants.

1405
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:55,720
谁
Who?

1406
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,000
霍普
Hope.

1407
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,690
等等  你想的是谁
Wait, who did you think?

1408
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:02,320
我
Me.

1409
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:03,620
你吗
You?

1410
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,730
别笑
Don't laugh.

1411
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:07,670
我能做个好搭档的
I'd be a great partner.

1412
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:09,200
小花生
Aw, peanut.

1413
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:11,730
你肯定可棒了
You would be awesome.

1414
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,020
但如果我允许你做
And if I let you...

1415
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:15,620
我就是个坏爸爸了
I would be a terrible dad.

1416
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:17,410
好吧
Fine.

1417
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:20,690
那就让霍普做你的搭档吧  她挺聪明的
Then have Hope be your partner. She's smart.

1418
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,000
她让我想到了你
She reminds me of you.

1419
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:26,120
你要去帮她吗
You gonna go help her?

1420
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:28,500
我觉得你该帮她
I think you should help her.

1421
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:30,490
我也希望我能
I wish I could, but...

1422
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:34,490
但我不知道我要怎么帮她而不伤害到你
I don't know how I could help her without hurting you.

1423
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:39,330
你可以的
You can do it.

1424
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,560
你什么都可以做到
You can do anything.

1425
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:44,860
你是世界上最棒的奶奶
You are the world's greatest grandma.

1426
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:54,610
吴探员一小时后来见你们
Agent Woo will see you in an hour.

1427
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:57,020
一小时  我们没有那么多时间
An hour? We don't have an hour.

1428
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:59,120
你们有别处要去吗
You got somewhere else to be?

1429
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:09,270
这才是我的好闺女
Oh, now, that's my girl.

1430
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:17,250
好了  我们的计划是什么
All right, what's our plan?

1431
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:20,750
缩小那面墙
To shrink that wall.

1432
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,890
看上去像是承重墙
It looks load-bearing.

1433
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:23,860
天花板可能会塌的
The ceiling could collapse.

1434
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:25,250
那我们就没命跑
Then we run like hell.

1435
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,050
我估计这一层有15到20个探员
Now, I estimate 15-20 agents on the floor.

1436
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:30,050
楼里大概还有五倍这个数的探员
Roughly five times that in the building at large.

1437
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:31,400
他们都有武器
They're all heavily armed.

1438
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,570
胜算不高
Not great odds.

1439
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:34,530
你有更好的主意吗
You got any better ideas?

1440
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:35,530
没有
Nope.

1441
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:37,950
我不会放弃妈妈的
And I'm not giving up on Mom.

1442
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:40,250
她肯定会为你骄傲的
She'd be so proud of you.

1443
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:46,470
好了
Okay.

1444
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:48,950
一
One...

1445
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:50,840
二
two...

1446
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:56,960
斯科特
Scott?

1447
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:58,730
你俩傻站着干什么
What're you two just standing around for?

1448
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:00,370
我们得去找到实验室
We gotta go find that lab.

1449
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:02,610
那我呢
What about me?

1450
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:04,980
好啊
Perfect.

1451
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:06,980
快换衣服  我们没多少时间
Hurry up and get dressed. We don't have much time.

1452
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,130
先生
Sir.

1453
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:21,710
现在呢
Okay, now what?

1454
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,050
你问我吗
You're asking me?

1455
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:26,680
进来
Get in!

1456
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:40,960
打扰  我们打算赶紧离开吗
Excuse me. Are we planning on leaving soon

1457
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,960
还是你俩要继续互相凝视
or are you two gonna keep staring at each other

1458
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,950
直到他们开始冲我们开火
until they start shooting at us?

1459
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:46,180
好吧
Yeah.

1460
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,130
-伯奇  -嗯
- Hey, Burch. - Yeah.

1461
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:54,050
他们出来了
Yeah, they're out.

1462
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:55,180
我就来
I'm on my way.

1463
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,790
她的战衣不见了  车也是
Her suit is missing, and so is the van.

1464
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:02,820
怎么会这样
How could this happen?

1465
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,440
怎么回事啊
I mean, what the dickens?

1466
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,240
谢谢
Thank you.

1467
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:10,500
不客气
You're welcome.

1468
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:14,660
我们怎么找到实验室
So, uh, how do we find the lab?

1469
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:16,540
丢过一次后
After we lost it the first time

1470
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,480
我放了新的追踪器
I put on a new tracker

1471
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:20,770
算是吧
of sorts.

1472
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:31,250
这也行
That'll work.

1473
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:59,440
好没好啊
Is it ready or not?

1474
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:02,430
我们可以开始进行提取了
We can begin the extraction process.

1475
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,050
听着  艾娃
Listen, Ava.

1476
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:07,110
这整件事可能会很危险
This whole thing could be very dangerous.

1477
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:08,600
或许我们该
Maybe we should...

1478
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,120
或许我们该什么  等吗
Maybe we should what? Wait?

1479
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:14,150
我只能再活几天了
I've got days until I'm dead.

1480
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,490
我们要做了  比尔
We're doing this, Bill.

1481
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:17,760
马上
Now.

1482
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:23,710
能量读数显示他们还没用过隧道
Energy readings show they have not used the tunnel yet.

1483
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:25,700
妈妈的位置过不了多久就会变化
We don't have much time before Mom's location shifts,

1484
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:26,600
我们就会失去她
and we lose her.

1485
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:28,670
是啊  那之前还有好多事呢
Yeah, and we have a lot to do before then.

1486
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,220
我爸爸总说
You know, my pep-pep always said,

1487
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:32,400
如果你想做好什么事  就列个单子
"If you want to do something right, you make a list."

1488
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,660
我们该那么做
So, we should do that.

1489
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:36,110
一  我们要闯入实验室
One, we have to break into that lab.

1490
01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:38,930
二  我们要赶走福斯特和幽灵
Two, we have to kick out Foster and Ghost.

1491
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:41,060
三  我们得跟幽灵打
Three, we're gonna have to fight Ghost.

1492
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:43,800
这似乎该是二的一部分  二A吧
That seems like it should be part of two. 2-A, all right?

1493
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,190
就算是二A吧
Let's call it 2-A.

1494
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:46,880
打幽灵  二A
Fight Ghost. 2-A.

1495
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:49,380
还有  我们得确保实验室恢复到原始大小
Also, we have to make sure that the lab is fully grown

1496
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:51,040
好让你出来  否则我们就完了
for you to come back. Otherwise, we're screwed.

1497
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:51,670
斯科特
Scott!

1498
01:13:51,670 --> 01:13:53,000
要我再说一次吗  我再说一次
You want me to start again? I'll start again...

1499
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,580
我去
I'm going to dive.

1500
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:59,120
我们要想成功  就得你俩在外面
The only chance we got is if the two of you are out here...

1501
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:02,030
一起保护隧道
together, protecting the tunnel.

1502
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:04,870
让我去吧  霍普  求你
Let me do this, Hope. Please.

1503
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,740
让我去接她
Let me get her.

1504
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:11,210
我觉得他是对的
I think he's right.

1505
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:20,780
好啊
"Whassup?"

1506
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,750
不记得那个特火的广告吗
You don't remember, uh, that beloved commercial?

1507
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:28,350
"好啊"
"Whassup?"

1508
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:30,330
我让他跟我们过来的
I had him follow us.

1509
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:32,720
我觉得我们会需要帮助
I thought we could use some help.

1510
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,770
好了  我就位了
All right. I'm in position.

1511
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:38,110
蚂蚁过去了
The ants are headed in.

1512
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:38,940
收到
Copy that.

1513
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,550
眼睛放亮了  斯科特
Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty.

1514
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,630
-来点糖吗  -不
- Do you want Pez? - No.

1515
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:45,700
我生日时凯西给我的
Cassie gave me this for my birthday.

1516
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,000
对了  我爱那套战衣
By the way, I love that suit!

1517
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:49,600
谢谢
Thanks, man.

1518
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:52,150
真希望我也有一套
I wish I had a suit.

1519
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:57,390
就算是没多少能力的我也会喜欢的
I would even like a suit with minimal powers, you know?

1520
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,470
或者就是一件没任何能力的战衣
Or maybe even just a suit, with no powers.

1521
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:17,530
怎么回事
What is it?

1522
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,370
不知道
Don't know.

1523
01:15:24,410 --> 01:15:25,550
是他们
It's them!

1524
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:29,420
他们肯定就在附近
They can't be far.

1525
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:52,710
汉克  汉克
All right, Hank. Hank?

1526
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,910
爸爸  你什么情况
Dad, what's your status?

1527
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:58,780
福斯特已经解决了
Foster's taken care of.

1528
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,630
这就换战衣
Suiting up now.

1529
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,050
我只是想救艾娃
I just wanted to save Ava.

1530
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:09,740
她要面临死亡或更恐怖的命运
She's facing death or something far more terrible.

1531
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:11,060

你怎么还没找到妈妈
Why haven't you found Mom?

1690
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:51,550
你似乎迷路了  汉克  你没事吧
You look lost, Hank. Are you all right?

1691
01:30:53,670 --> 01:30:56,400
还觉得你无所不知吗  汉克

但你手里发出的那股能量
But that energy from your hands...

1701
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:31,080
你怎么做到的
how did you do that?

1702
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,820
我已经不是30年前的那个女人了  亨利
I'm not the same woman I was 30 years ago, Henry.

1703

这地方

01:32:50,210 --> 01:32:52,670
实验室坐标未找到

不能上升

1709
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:58,450
我或许该跟你说说上面的情况
I should probably tell you what we're dealing with up there.

1710

我拿到实验室了

-斯科特要没气的  -好

1729

不在我这儿
I don't have it. I don't have it.

1747

看来我们要说
I guess this is where we say

1748
01:36:07,390 --> 01:36:08,680
再见了  哥们
Adios, amigo.

你这次是逃脱了  斯科特

就是...泛泛地说
Like, in general...

1852

我就会抓到你
I'll be there to catch you...

1854

我也想啊  你为什么要那么做啊

不  我是"回头再逮你"的意思

1861
01:45:01,310 --> 01:45:02,980
当然  不然就太奇怪了
Of course, that would be strange.

1862
01:45:02,990 --> 01:45:04,250
-你保重  吉米  -好

你想一起吃个饭吗
Did you want to grab dinner, or something?

1864

我也没事...
I mean, because I'm free...

1865
01:45:09,690 --> 01:45:10,800

我想帮助他人
