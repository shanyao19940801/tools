你本可把转速翻倍的

而他完全不知道自己在做什么

他把钢铁侠武器当做玩具

不能治愈  只能缓解症状
It's not a cure, it just abates the symptoms.

1000

看上去解决办法不会很简单的

那...那不是头盔  那是什么
Is that... That's not a helmet. What is that?

1023
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:02,700
伊凡  这是什么
Ivan... What's this?

1024
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:03,790
杰克
Jack.

1025
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:06,470
那是头盔吗  我看不像
Is that a helmet? It doesn't look like a helmet to me.

1026
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:09,100
这玩意要怎么戴在脑袋上
How... How are you supposed to get a head in there?

1027
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:10,960
-杰克  你的脑袋能放进去吗  -不能
- Jack, could you put your head in there? - No.

1028
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,240
试试把脑袋放进去
Try to put your head in there.

1029
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,110
试试吧  看能不能把脑袋放进去
Go ahead. Try to put your head in there.

1030
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:16,020
看  伊凡  他不能把脑袋放进去
See, Ivan? He can't put his head in there.

1031
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:18,650
这不是头盔
That's... That's not a helmet.

1032
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:21,390
而是脑袋  我得让人进去
It's a head. I need to put a guy in there.

1033
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:25,010
我得让战衣里能进个人  明白吗
I need to fit a person in that suit. You understand?

1034
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,500
-无人机更好  -什么  无人机更好
- Drone better. - What? Drone better?

1035
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,180
为什么  为什么无人机更好
Why is drone better? Why is drone better?

1036
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,660
人会制造问题
People make problem.

1037
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,930
相信我  无人机更好
Trust me. Drone better.

1038
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:38,510
伊凡  我喜欢你  我给你把鸟拿来了
Ivan, you know, I like you. I got you the bird.

1039
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,180
你说"没问题"的
You said, "No problem."

1040
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:44,010
你是跟我这么说的  你说"没问题"
That's what you said to me. You said, "No problem."

1041
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:47,160
我需要战衣  政府要战衣
Now I need suits. The government wants suits.

1042
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:49,280
就像钢铁侠  懂吗
Like Iron Man. You understand?

1043
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,800
那才是人们要的  那会让他们开心
That's what the people want. That's what's gonna make them happy.

1044
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,140
哥们
Hey, man.

1045
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:58,680
别太执迷于身外物
Don't get too attached to things.

1046
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:00,880
学会放手
Learn to let go.

1047
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:07,400
这些无人机最好能抢风头  伊凡
These drones better steal the show, Ivan.

1048
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:11,430
明白吗  最好让我震撼  伊凡
You understand? Better rock my world, Ivan.

1049
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,730
难以置信
Unbelievable.

1050
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:25,730
这应该足以让参议院放过我了
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.

1051
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:29,490
-可以用吗  -完全能执行任务
- It's functional? - Fully mission-capable.

1052
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:32,520
很好  让汉默过来把它武器化
Good. Get Hammer down here to weaponize it.

1053
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:34,660
长官
Sir?

1054
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:37,750
贾斯汀·汉默要在博览会上进行武器展示
Justin Hammer's making a weapons presentation at the Expo.

1055
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:39,360
我们要用它进行介绍
We'd like this to introduce it.

1056
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,010
长官  我不觉得博览会
Sir, I don't believe that the Expo...

1057
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:43,940
中校  得尽快让世界看到它
Colonel, the world needs to see this fast.

1058
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:47,010
-我们必须做到  -是  将军  但是
- We've got to make this happen. - Yes, General, but...

1059
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:49,020
这还是命令
It's also an order.

1060
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:50,580
是  长官
Yes, sir.

1061
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:54,020
好样的  中校  国家以你为傲
Good work, Colonel. You've made your country proud.

1062
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:55,770
谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

1063
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:06,410
你胸口的那玩意是基于未完成的科技
That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.

1064
01:07:06,410 --> 01:07:06,990
不  是完成的
No, it was finished.

1065
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,220
但此前并不是很高效
It has never been particularly effective

1066
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:11,720
直到我把它缩小  放进了我的...
until I miniaturized it and put it in my...

1067
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,600
不  霍华德说方舟反应堆
No. Howard said the arc reactor

1068
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,730
是通向更伟大发明的垫脚石
was the stepping stone to something greater.

1069
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:17,470
他本来要开展能源竞赛
He was about to kick off an energy race

1070
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:20,790
把军备竞赛远远地比下去
that was gonna dwarf the arms race.

1071
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:21,840
他在研究什么大项目
He was on to something big,

1072
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:25,420
大到能把核反应堆比得像
something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor

1073
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,410
3A电池的东西
look like a triple-A battery.

1074
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,990
就他一人吗  还是安东·万科也参加了
Just him, or was Anton Vanko in on this, too?

1075
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:33,190
安东·万科是硬币的另一面
Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin.

1076
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:35,290
安东把这视为生财之道
Anton saw it as a way to get rich.

1077
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:37,950
你父亲发现后  将他驱逐出境了
When your father found out, he had him deported.

1078
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:39,810
而当苏联发现他光说不能做时
When the Russians found out he couldn't deliver,

1079
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:41,310
就把他送去了西伯利亚
they shipped his ass off to Siberia

1080
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:44,360
接下来20年里  伏特加让他越来越愤怒
and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage.

1081
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,850
那并不是养孩子的好环境
Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in,

1082
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:50,930
你不幸在摩纳哥遭遇了他的儿子
the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.

1083
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,880
你跟我说  我还没试全
You told me I hadn't tried everything.

1084
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,030
什么意思  我没试全
What do you mean I haven't tried everything?

1085
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:55,060
我还有什么没试的
What haven't I tried?

1086
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:56,220
他说
He said that

1087
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:59,560
你是唯一有办法有知识
you were the only person with the means and knowledge

1088
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,260
完成他未竟事业的人
to finish what he started.

1089
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,580
这是他说的
He said that?

1090
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,520
你是那样的人吗  是吗
Are you that guy? Are you?

1091
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:07,380
因为如果你是
'Cause if you are,

1092
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:11,870
那你就能解决你心脏的谜题
then you can solve the riddle of your heart.

1093
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:16,990
我不知道你的情报哪来的
I don't know where you get your information,

1094
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:19,490
但他并没那么喜欢我
but he wasn't my biggest fan.

1095
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:20,850
你对你爸爸都记得什么
What do you remember about your dad?

1096
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:22,740
他很冷漠  算计
He was cold, he was calculating.

1097
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:25,520
他从不对我说他爱我  甚至不说他喜欢我
He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me,

1098
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,200
所以我有点难以相信
so it's a little tough for me to digest

1099
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,790
你说他曾说未来全靠我了
when you're telling me he said the whole future was riding on me

1100
01:08:29,790 --> 01:08:32,820
还说他传承给我了  我不理解
and he's passing it down. I don't get that.

1101
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:34,010
这家伙最开心的一天
You're talking about a guy whose happiest day

1102
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,820
就是把我送去寄宿学校的那天
was when he shipped me off to boarding school.

1103
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:36,750
才不是这样
That's not true.

1104
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:39,400
那你显然比我更了解我爸
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.

1105
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:41,450
其实  还真是这样
As a matter of fact, I did.

1106
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:43,680
他是神盾局的创建者之一
He was one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1107
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:44,730
什么

1108
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:47,620
-我2点还有安排  -等等
- I got a 2:00. - Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1109
01:08:47,770 --> 01:08:49,150
-这是什么  -你没事了吧
- What's this? - Okay, you're good, right?

1110
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:51,090
-不  我有事  -你可以了吧  是吧
- No, I'm not good. - You got this? Right? Right?

1111
01:08:51,090 --> 01:08:53,080
可以什么  我根本没听明白
Got what? I don't even know what I'm supposed to get.

1112
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:56,440
娜塔莎会继续以伪装身份待在斯塔克工业
Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact.

1113
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:59,370
-你记得科尔森特工吧  -嗯
- You remember Agent Coulson, right? - Yeah.

1114
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:00,910
托尼
And Tony,

1115
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:05,280
记住  我看着你呢
remember, I got my eye on you.

1116
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:12,980
我们切断了所有通讯
We've disabled all communications.

1117
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:14,850
不能与外界接触
No contact with the outside world.

1118
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:15,880
祝你好运
Good luck.

1119
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:21,350
拜托
Please.

1120
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:24,140
首先  我需要身行头
First thing, I need a little bodywork.

1121
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:25,520
我会去实验室忙活一会儿
I'll put in a little time at the lab.

1122
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,830
如果能麻烦你的哪个手下去趟
If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean,

1123
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,630
连锁咖啡店买点咖啡回来
Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that,

1124
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:30,210
就太棒了
that'd be nice.

1125
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:31,660
我不是来做那个的
I'm not here for that.

1126
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:32,990
弗瑞局长授权我
I've been authorized by Director Fury

1127

-如果你企图离开  -好吧
- If you attempt to leave - Right.

1129
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:38,320
或是耍花招

我就电击你  然后去看《超级保姆》
I will tase you and watch Supernanny

少校  这不是科学练习
Major, this is not a scientific exercise.

1137

汉默  我想知道你要为我们做什么

首先我要为你们做的

然后  我想...
And then, second, I think I should...

1150
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:47,270
我不是问那个  汉默
That's not what I'm talking about. Hammer.

1151
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:49,430
我是问火力
I'm talking about firepower.

1152
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:53,390
那你找对人了
Well, you're talking to the right guy.

1158
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:10,500
我说什么呢  这个不要了

1289
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:52,830
但我没有完全对你说实话
But I haven't been entirely upfront with you,

1290
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:53,970
我想做正确的事

如果我从没表达...
And if I never got to express...

1296
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,950
对了  这对我来说也挺有启示性

我不在乎...我在乎的  那样就好了
And I don't care... I mean, I care. It would be nice.

- I'm just gonna say it. - Let me stop you right here, okay?

因为如果你再说一个"我"

我真的要拿什么东西砸你的脑袋了

-你知道那都包括做什么吗  -知道
- Do you have any idea what that entails? - Yes.

大家都指望着你做钢铁侠  而你却失踪了
People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you've disappeared,

1306
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:32,890
而我只能到处灭你的火

1307
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:34,590
并为此承受压力
and taking the heat for it.

那是什么意思  伊凡
What the hell does that mean, Ivan?

1418
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:06,740
我们说好的可不是这样
This is not what we agreed to, okay?

1419
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:09,330
你先是说能做战衣  然后又说能做无人机

那是你的鸟吗  我都糊涂了

你之前说不是的  但现在看来关系好得很
You said it wasn't, but now it looks like you're best of pals.

1425

你喜欢那只鸟  是吧
You love that bird, don't you?

1426
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:43,660
这样吧  把鸟拿走

你有什么感觉  难过吗

很好  因为那就是我的感觉

我们有合同的
We had a contract.

1433
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:13,240
我救你一命
I saved your life

1434
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:16,240
你给我战衣
and you give me suits.

1435
01:29:16,430 --> 01:29:18,420
那是我们的协议
That was our deal.

1436
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:20,240
而你没能做到
And you did not deliver.

1437
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:23,990
我不知道你是天才还是骗子
I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud.

1438
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,500
我不知道你算什么
I don't know what you are.

1439
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:31,160
有很棒的东西恰好从天上掉进了我怀里
Something really, really great fell into my lap.

1440
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:35,460
否则  我今晚只能指望你的本事了
And if it hadn't, I'd be at your mercy tonight.

1441
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:39,650
我自己弄到了一件斯塔克的装置
Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself.

1442
01:29:39,650 --> 01:29:41,260
现在  你价格过高的镇纸
And now your overpriced paperweights

1443
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:44,510
会变成我的演示的陪衬
are gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration.

1444
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:46,460
你明白我想说什么了吧
Do you dig what I'm getting at here?

1445
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:53,120
不知道你是否知道  但我不会说俄语
I don't know if you know this, but I don't speak Russian!

1446
01:29:56,570 --> 01:29:57,950
我要走了
I'm gonna leave now.

1447
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:01,860
我要去博览会  或许还能享享艳福
I'm gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I'll even get laid.

1448
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,410
看到他们了吗  他们是你的保姆
You see these guys? They're your babysitters.

1449
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:06,430
你最好别惹他们
They are not to be trifled with.

1450
01:30:07,330 --> 01:30:09,320
等我回来时  我们要重新商讨
When I get back, we're gonna renegotiate

1451
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,190
我们协议的条款
the terms of our agreement.

1452
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:14,680
你要照协议办事
And you're gonna make good on our arrangement

1453
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:15,870
否则
