基里安
Killian?

305
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,020
你气色不错  真的非常好
You look great. You look really great.

306
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,240
天啊  你看起来  也很棒
God, you look...you look great.

307
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,240
我无法...
I... I... I can't...

308
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,140
你这几年都做了什么
What on earth have you been doing?

309
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,290
没什么大事
Nothing fancy,

310
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,580
只是让理疗师收拾了五年
just five years in the hands of physical therapists.

311
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,870
还有  叫我阿德里奇吧
And please, call me Aldrich.

312
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,040
你应该拿到了门禁卡吧
You were supposed to be issued a security badge.

313
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,250
-哈皮  没事的  -是吗
- Happy, it's okay.- Yes?

314
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,620
-我们没事  -确定吗
- We're good. - You sure?

315
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,850
-是的  你走吧  -好
- Yes. Stand down. - Okay.

316
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,880
-我就在附近  好吧  -谢谢
- I'm gonna linger, right here. Okay. - Thank you.

317
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,940
见到你真高兴  基里安
It's very nice to see you, Killian.

318
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,420
伙计
Hey, guy.

319
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,470
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

320
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,580
这么多年来规避着总统的
After years dodging the president's ban

321
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,620
不道德生物研究禁令
on "immoral biotech research",

322
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,590
我的智囊团终于有所突破了
my think tank now has a little something in the pipeline.

323
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,430
我把这个点子称为绝境病毒
It's an idea we like to call Extremis.

324
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,580
让我把灯关一下
I'm gonna turn your lights down.

325
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,160
请看人类的大脑
Regard the human brain.

326
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,610
等等  暂停一下
Wait. Hold on, hold on.

327
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,250
那是宇宙的图像  我的错  让我按一下
That's...that's the universe, my bad. But if I do that...

328
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,150
这才是大脑
That's the brain.

329
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,700
它们惊人地类似  不是吗
Strangely mimetic though, wouldn't you say?

330
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,060
太不可思议了
Wow, that's amazing!

331
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,380
多谢  那是我的大脑
Thanks, it's mine.

332
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,890
什么
What?

333
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,980
这是我的大脑内部  这是个
This...you're inside my head. It's a...

334
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,530
实况转播
It's a live feed.

335
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,030
站上来  我证明给你看
Come on up, I'll prove it to you.

336
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,890
来吧
Come on.

337
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,630
现在  掐我胳膊
Now, pinch my arm.

338
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,880
我受得了  掐吧
I can take it. Pinch me.

339
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,020
那是什么
What is that?

340
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,060
是初级躯体感觉皮层
It's the primary somatosensory cortex.

341
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,520
大脑中感知疼痛的部分
It's the brain's pain center.

342
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,920
这才是我想给你看的
But this is what I wanted to show you.

343
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,460
绝境病毒开发了我们的生物潜能
Now, Extremis harnesses our bioelectrical potential

344
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,210
现在看  这里
And it goes...here.

345
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,190
这基本上是个空槽
This is essentially an empty slot,

346
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,620
这说明我们的大脑
and what this tells us is that our mind,

347
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,350
其实是我们的整个DNA
our entire DNA in fact,

348
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,090
注定该被升级
is destined to be upgraded.

349
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,880
{\an8}派珀·波茨改革斯塔克工业

350
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,910
你好
Hello?

351
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,090
是安保额头吗
Is this forehead of Security?

352
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,810
什么
What?

353
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,400
听着  我有正事呢  你有什么事
You know, look, I got a real job. What do you want?

354
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,600
我在工作  现在有情况
I'm working, I got something going on here.

355
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,740
什么情况  骚扰实习生吗
What? Harassing interns?

356
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,320
我告诉你一件事
Let me tell you something,

357
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,120
当我告诉大家我曾是钢铁侠的保镖时
you know what happened when I told people

358
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,260
你知道他们什么反应吗
I was Iron Man's body guard?

359
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,780
他们无情地嘲笑我
They would laugh in my face.

360
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,920
我只能带着最后一丝尊严离开
I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity.

361
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,840
现在我有了真正的工作  照顾派珀
Now I got a real job, I'm watching Pepper.

362
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,230
发生了什么  告诉我
What's going on? Fill me in.

363
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,920
-真要听吗  -对
- For real? - Yeah.

364
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,760
好吧  她在会见一个科学家
Alright, so she's meeting up with this scientist.

365
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,330
-阔佬  长得也帅  -好吧
- Rich guy, handsome. - Right.

366
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,570
我一开始没认出他来
I couldn't make his face at first, right?

367
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,630
你也知道我认人最在行了
You know I'm good with faces.

368
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,290
没错  你是个中翘楚
Oh, Yeah, yeah. You're the best.

369
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,470
就是  然后我查了他的信息
Yeah. Well, so I run his credentials,

370
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,350
才认出他  阿德里奇·基里安
I make him Aldrich Killian.

371
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,030
我们以前其实见过他
We actually met the guy back in...

372
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,430
1999年  在哪来着  那个科学会议
where were we in '99? The science conference?

373
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,540
在瑞士
Switzerland.

374
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,500
对  没错  就是那儿
Right, right, exactly.

375
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,920
基里安  不  我不记得那家伙
Killian? No, I don't remember that guy.

376
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,660
你当然不记得  他又不是金发大波妹
Of course you don't. He's not a blond with a big rack.

377
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,050
一开始还好  他们只是谈生意
At first it was fine, they were talking business,

378
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,120
但现在有点蹊跷了
but now it's like getting weird.

379
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,640
他正在给她看他的大大脑
He's showing her his big brain.

380
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,430
他的什么
His what?

381
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,170
放大的大脑  她也乐在其中
Big brain, and she likes it.

382
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,320
让我给你看
Here, let me show you.

383
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,940
等一下  看到了吗
Hold on. See?

384
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,950
看到什么  看到你在偷窥吗
Look at what? You watching them?

385
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,680
把屏幕翻过去我才能看到
Flip the screen and then we can get started.

386
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,030
我又不是你这种科学天才
I'm not a tech genius like you.

387
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,480
相信我  快过来吧
Just...just trust me, get down down here.

388
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,850
翻转屏幕  让我看到他们在做什么
Flip the screen, then I can see what they're doing.

389
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,850
我不会  我不会翻转屏幕
I can't! I don't know how to flip the screen!

390
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,740
别再那样对我说话了
Don't talk to me like that anymore.

391
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,030
你可不是我老板
You're not my boss.

392
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,180
我又不为你工作
Alright, I don't work for you.

393
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,740
我不信任这家伙
Now I don't trust this guy.

394
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,880
他还带了个鬼鬼祟祟的家伙
He's got another guy with him, he's shifty.

395
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,620
-放松点  -真的吗
- Relax. - Seriously?

396
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,500
我只是让你守住周边
I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter.

397
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,520
让他出去喝一杯什么的
Tell him to go out for a drink or something?

398
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,360
你知道吗  你真的应该
You know what? You should take more

399
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,580
好好关注一下事态发展
of an interest in what's going on here.

400
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,370
这女人是你生命中最美好的际遇
This woman... this woman's the best thing that ever happened to you,

401
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,120
而你呢  你却不知珍惜
and you... you're just ignoring her.

402
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,740
巨型大脑吗
A giant brain?

403
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,350
没错  巨型大脑  还有个鬼祟之徒
Yeah, there's a giant brain, there's a shifty character.

404
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,700
我要去跟着他
I'm gonna follow this guy.

405
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,100
查他的车牌  要是他来硬的  那就来吧
I'm gonna run his plates and if it gets rough, so be it.

406
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,490
我想念你  哈皮
I miss you, Happy.

407
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,630
我也想念你
Yeah, I miss you too.

408
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,070
但是想念以前的样子
But the way it used to be.

409
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,030
现在你都跟超级英雄朋友泡在一起
Now you're off with the 'superfriends',

410
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,490
我都不知道你什么情况了
I don't know what's going on with you anymore.

411
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,170
世界越来越奇怪了
The world's getting weird...

412
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,540
抱歉  我得挂断你了
Hey, I... I'd hate to cut you off.

413
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,650
-你带着电击枪吗  -怎么了
- Do you have your taser on you? - Why?

414
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,460
人力资源部好像有个女孩
I think there's a gal in HR

415
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,810
在试图偷打印机墨水
who's trying to steal some printer ink,

416
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,250
你应该过去教训她一下
you should probably go over there and zap her.

417
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,450
好极了
Yeah, nice.

418
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,550
想象一下  如果你可以侵入
Imagine if you could hack into the hard drive of

419
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,970
任何生物体的"硬盘"  然后重组其DNA
any living organism and recode its DNA.

420
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,280
那太惊人了
It would be incredible.

421
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,710
不幸的是  听起来也很有武器化前途
Unfortunately, to my ears it also sounds highly weaponizable.

422
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,550
比如改造士兵  和私人军队  托尼他...
As in enhanced soldiers, private armies, and Tony is not...

423
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,260
托尼  托尼
Tony. Tony.

424
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,760
13年前我曾邀请托尼加入AIM
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM thirteen years ago,

425
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,400
他拒绝了
he turned me down.

426
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:56,930
但现在我发现
But something tells me

427
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,500
掌权的是另一个天才
now there is a new genius on the throne

428
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,470
她不必向托尼汇报
who doesn't have to answer to Tony anymore,

429
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,360
也没那么自负
and who has slightly less of an ego.

430
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,480
我的答案是不  阿德里奇
It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.

431
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,500
我虽然非常想帮你
As much as I'd like to help you.

432
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,360
好吧  我确实有点失望
Well, I can't say that I'm not disappointed.

433
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,890
但正如我父亲曾说的
But then as my father used to say,

434
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,610
透过失败的迷雾  才能窥见胜利的光辉
'Failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph.'

435
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,920
很有深度
That's very deep.

436
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,860
但我不知道是什么意思
And I have no idea what it means.

437
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,440
我也不懂  我爸就是个傻瓜
Well, me neither. He was kind of an idiot, my old man.

438
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,530
我们一定会再见的  派珀
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.

439
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,950
哈皮
Happy...

440
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,040
车备好了  你准备好出发了吗
The car is ready, if you're ready to go.

441
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,560
嗯  我只是...
Yes. I just um...

442
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,790
忘了点什么东西  我得去...
God, I forgot my other thing, so I'm just gonna...

443
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,100
{\an8}圣诞快乐  派珀

444
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,620
抱歉我来晚了  我刚才在  这是什么
I'm sorry I'm late. I was... What the...? What is that?!

445
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,820
你在屋里也要穿了吗
You're wearing this in the house now?

446
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,060
那是什么  马克15型吗
What is that, like Mark 15?

447
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,360
{\an8}马克42型

448
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,070
嗯  差不多吧
Yeah. Something like that.

449
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,840
人总得有个爱好
You know everybody needs a hobby.

450
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,920
你非得在客厅里穿着你的爱好吗
And you have to wear your hobby in the living room?

451
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,380
新衣服要适应
Just breakin' it in.

452
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,680
你明白吧  裤裆那里总是有点紧
You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so.

453
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,980
你看到你的圣诞礼物了吗
Did you see your Christmas present?

454
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,030
看到了
Yes, I did.

455
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,200
我没办法错过那么大的圣诞礼物
I... I don't know how I could have missed that Christmas present.

456
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,100
能搬进门来吗
Is it gonna fit through the door?

457
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,840
这个问题问得好
Well actually, uh...it's a good question.

458
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,090
明天我叫了一队人来
I got a team of guys comin' tomorrow,

459
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,910
-他们会把墙炸了  -好吧
- they're gonna blow out that wall. - Okay.

460
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,620
今天忙不忙  还是挺好
So, uh... tense? Good day?

461
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,320
按摩一下肩吧  你这个调皮的小女孩
Ooh shoulders, a little naughty. Naughty girl.

462
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,230
我不想啰嗦  不过你喜欢那订制的兔子吗
I don't wanna harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?

463
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,410
我喜欢吗
Did I like it?

464
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,860
俘虏了你的心  对吧
Nailed it, right?

465
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,400
我很感激你的心思
I appreciate the thought very much.

466
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,920
你为什么不掀起面罩  给我一个热吻呢
So why don't you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?

467
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,340
哎呀  该死  打不开
Yup, dammit. No can do.

468
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,810
你要不要亲在...
You wanna just kiss it on the...

469
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,420
面罩缝上
The facial slit?

470
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,450
那不如我去车库
Well, why don't I run down to the garage

471
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,090
找个撬棍把它弄开
and see if I can't find a crowbar to shimmy that thing open?

472
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,320
撬棍  真棒
Crowbar. Yeah.

473
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,350
可是车库...那个  辐射泄漏了
Oh, except there's been a...uh...A radiation leak.

474
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,470
我愿意冒这个险
I'll take my chances.

475
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,420
太危险了
That's risky.

476
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,730
至少让我给你找件防护衣
At least let me get you like a Hazmat suit

477
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,730
或是盖革计数器之类的东西
or a Geiger counter or something like that.

478
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,210
被发现了
Busted.

479
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,080
你真是无聊到新境界了
This is a new level of lame.

480
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,720
对不起
Sorry.

481
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,720
今晚是约会之夜  你不等我就吃了
You ate without me, already? On date night?

482
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,520
-他只是...  -你是说你吧
- He was just... - You mean you?

483
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,930
没错  我是说我们  只是在招待你
Well, yeah. I mean we were just... just hosting you.

484
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,180
我做完了点工作
While I finished up a little work.

485
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,560
所以就吃了一点东西
And yes, I had a quick bite.

486
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,500
我不知道你回不回家
I didn't know if you were comin' home

487
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,110
还是跟阿德里奇·基里安喝酒去了
or if you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.

488
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,990
干什么
What?

489
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,710
怎么了
What?

490
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,350
阿德里奇·基里安  你还查我岗吗
Aldrich Killian? What are you checking up on me?

491
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,920
哈皮觉得担心
Happy was concerned.

492
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,430
-不  你就是在监视我  -我没有
- No, you're spying on me. - I wasn't...

493
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,120
我要去睡觉了
I'm going to bed.

494
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,280
等等  别走  小派
Hold on. Come on. Pep.

495
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,750
好吧  我承认是我错了  对不起
Hey, I admit it! My fault. Sorry.

496
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,410
我最近一团糟
I'm a piping hot mess.

497
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,630
有段时间了  我一直没告诉你
It's been going on for a while, I haven't said anything.

498
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,420
纽约事件后  一切都变了
Nothing's been the same since New York.

499
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:35,190
是吗  我可完全没有注意到
Oh really? Well, I didn't notice that, at all.

500
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,110
你经历了一些事
You experience things

501
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,870
事情过去后  你还是没法解释清楚
and then they're over and you still can't explain 'em.

502
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,150
神  外星人  其他空间
Gods, aliens, other dimensions.

503
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,150
我只是一个躲在铁壳里的人
I... I'm just a man in a can.

504
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,460
我至今还没有崩溃的原因
The only reason I haven't cracked up

505
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,270
大概就是因为你搬来和我一起住
is probably because you moved in.

506
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,220
这太好了  我爱你  我很幸运
Which is great. I love you, I'm lucky.

507
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,360
但是  宝贝  我睡不着
But, honey, I can't sleep.

508
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,880
你睡着了  我就下来
You go to bed, I come down here.

509
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,040
做我熟悉的事
I do what I know,

510
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,010
敲敲打打
I tinker.

511
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,700
但是危险即将来临
But threat is imminent,

512
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,690
我必须保护我唯一不能失去的东西
and I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without.

513
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,410
就是你
That's you.

514
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,480
我的战衣  它们只是
My suits, they're uh...

515
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,690
机器而已
Machines.

516
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,790
但它们是我的一部分
But they're part of me.

517
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,000
这只是个消遣
A distraction.

518
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,170
也许吧
Maybe.

519
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,440
我要去洗个澡
I'm gonna take a shower.

520
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,420
好吧
Okay.

521
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,190
你也一起来吧
And you're gonna join me.

522
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,480
更好了
Better.

523
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
托尼
Tony!

524
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,160
托尼  托尼
Tony! Tony!

525
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,630
托尼
Tony...

526
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,200
关闭电源
Power down!

527
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,650
我一定是在睡梦中启动了它
I must have called it in my sleep.

528
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,240
这事不应该发生的
That's not supposed to happen.

529
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,360
我会重新校准一下传感器
I'll recalibrate the sensors.

530
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,390
我们能不能  让我
Can we just... just let me...

531
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,120
让我先喘口气好吗
just let me catch my breath, okay?

532
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,990
别走  好吗  派珀
Don't go, alright? Pepper?

533
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,210
我要去楼下睡  你去敲打那个吧
I'm going to sleep downstairs. Tinker with that.

534
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,480
你扛得住吗
Can you regulate?

535
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,040
扛得住
Yes, I can regulate.

536
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,830
你确定吗
Are you sure about that?

537
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,740
确定
Yes.

538
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,820
这批货不错
It's a decent batch.

539
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,260
别说我不为你着想
Don't say I never did nothin' for you.

540
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,220
谢谢
Thank you.

541
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,590
理解万岁
I mean for understanding.

542
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,150
对不起  伙计
I'm sorry, buddy.

543
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,720
你干什么呢  伙计  自己出来的吗
What are you doin', buddy? You out by yourself?

544
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,310
约会之夜吗  看你最喜欢的言情片
A little date night? Watching your favorite chick flick maybe?

545
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,060
没错  一部叫做《派对结束》的电影
Yeah, a little movie called "The Party's Over",

546
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,040
主角是你和你嗑药的女朋友
starring you and your junkie girlfriend,

547
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,580
这是电影票
and here's the ticket.

548
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,890
开玩笑吧  那不是你的东西
No kidding? That doesn't belong to you.

549
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,980
萨文
Savin!

550
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,290
救救我  救救我
Help! Help me!

551
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,800
福饼的真相是
True story about fortune cookies.

552
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,690
它们看上去像来自中国
They look Chinese,

553
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:16,490
听上去也像
they sound Chinese,

554
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,130
但其实它们是美国制造
but they're actually an American invention.

555
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,140
所以它们是空心的
Which is why they're hollow,

556
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,250
充满了谎言
full of lies,

557
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,230
还会在嘴里留下恶心的味道
and leave a bad taste in the mouth.

558
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:34,010
我的门徒刚摧毁了又一个廉价的美国山寨
My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knock-off,

559
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,890
中国剧院
The Chinese Theater.

560
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,360
总统先生  我知道这一定很令人沮丧
Mr. President, I know this must be getting frustrating,

561
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:47,240
但是这一季度的恐怖事件已经接近尾声了
but this season of terror is drawing to a close.

562
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,260
别担心  好戏还在后头呢
And don't worry, the big one is coming;

563
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,560
你的毕业典礼
your graduation.

564
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,340
别关电视行吗
Mind leaving that on?

565
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,840
好的
Sure.

566
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,000
周日晚上的固定节目《唐顿庄园》
Sunday night's PBS 'Downtown Abbey'.

567
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,730
他最喜欢看这个  他觉得很高雅
That's his show, he thinks it's elegant.

568
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,570
还有  让所有人都带上门卡
One more thing... make sure everyone wears their badges.

569
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,940
他对这种事情特别固执
He's a stickler for that sort of thing,

570
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,730
不然我的人不会让进的
plus my guys won't let anyone in without them.

571
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,260
我们在等待托尼·斯塔克的到来
We're awaiting the arrival of Tony Stark.

572
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,960
希望他能就刚刚发生的袭击事件
We're hoping he'll give us the reaction...

573
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,290
给我们一些回应
his reaction to the latest attack.

574
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,930
斯塔克先生  斯塔克先生
Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark!

575
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,610
有消息说
Our sources are telling us that

576
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,140
这又是一次满大人发动的袭击事件
this is another Mandarin attack.

577
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,750
您对此怎么说
Anything else you can tell us?

578
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,950
斯塔克先生
Mr. Stark!

579
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,050
什么时候才会有人杀了这家伙
When is somebody gonna kill this guy?

580
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,000
我就说说
Just sayin'.

581
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,890
你就想听这个吗
Is that what you want?

582
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,650
我早想给满大人
Here's a little holiday greeting

583
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,900
一个小小的节日问候
I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin.

584
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,220
我刚刚才想好措辞
I just didn't know how to phrase it until now.

585
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,880
我叫托尼·斯塔克  我不怕你
My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you.

586
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,770
我知道你是个懦夫
I know you're a coward,

587
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:18,170
所以我决定  你是死人了  伙计
so I've decided that you just died, pal.

588
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,890
我会亲自去收尸
I'm gonna come get the body.

589
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,200
无关政治
There's no politics here;

590
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,310
只有老式的复仇
it's just good old-fashioned revenge.

591
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,390
无关五角大楼
There's no Pentagon;

592
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,300
只有你和我
it's just you and me.

593
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,230
如果你还是个男人
And on the off-chance you're a man,

594
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,870
记着我家地址
here's my home address:

595
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:35,190

596
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,420
我的房门时刻大开
I'll leave the door unlocked.

597
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,410
你就想要这个  是吧
That's what you wanted, right?

598
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,440
我赔你
Bill me.

599
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,040
我已经把满大人的资料整理好了  先生
I've compiled a Mandarin database for you, sir.

600
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,200
来源是神盾局  联邦调查局

647
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,190
是你把地址给了全世界的记者

756
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,560
那很自私也很愚蠢  以后再也不会了
That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again.

757
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,540
还有  现在是圣诞  那兔子太大了
Also, it's Christmas time, the rabbit's too big.

758
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,050
就这样  对不起
Done. I'm sorry.

759
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,680
我还要预道歉  因为
And I'm sorry in advance because...

760
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,030
我还不能回家
I can't come home yet.

761
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:21,230
我得找到那家伙  你要注意安全
I need to find this guy. You gotta stay safe.

762
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,190
我就想说这个
That's all I know.

763
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,720
我刚从一个印第安木人身上偷了一件斗篷
I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian.

764
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,800
坐舒服点
Let's get you comfy.

765
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,660
你现在开心了吧
You happy now?

766
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:08,100
停下
Freeze!

767
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,770
别动
Don't move.

768
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,050
被你抓住了
You got me.

769
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,270
土豆枪不错
Nice potato gun.

770
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,610
就是枪管有点长
Barrel's a little long.

771
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:22,360
又长又粗的话  会减弱它的攻击力
Between that and the wide gauge, it's gonna diminish your FPS

772
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,880
现在你还没弹药了
And now you're out of ammo.

773
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,360
你胸口上那个东西是什么
What's that thing on your chest?

774
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,250
是个电磁体  你应该懂的
It's a electromagnet. You should know,

775
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,820
你这里有一整盒呢
you've got a box of them right here.

776
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:37,260
它是给什么供电的
What does it power?

777
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,620
我的天啊
Oh my God!

778
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,940
那个
That...

779
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:53,930
那是
that's...

780
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,000
那是钢铁侠吗
Is that Iron Man?

781
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,260
其实  我才是
Technically, I am.

782
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,970
其实  你已经死了
Technically, you're dead.

783
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,200
{\an8}满大人袭击  斯塔克据推测已死

784
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,120
有道理
A valid point.

785
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,710
他怎么了
What happened to him?

786
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:04,600
生活艰辛
Life.

787
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:06,950
我建造了他  我照顾他
I built him, I take care of him.

788
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:10,910
现在我要修好他
I'll fix him.

789
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,910
像机械师那样吗
Like a mechanic?

790
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:12,790
是的
Yeah.

791
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,840
如果是我在造钢铁侠和战争机器的话
If I was building Iron Man and War Machine...

792
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,000
现在叫钢铁爱国者了
It's Iron Patriot now.

793
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,330
这样酷多了
That's way cooler!

794
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:21,330
才不是
No, it's not.

795
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:26,030
好吧  是我的话就加上  那个逆...
Anyways, I would have added in um... the retro...

796
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,020
逆反射板吗
Retroreflective panels?

797
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,350
让他可以隐形
To make him stealth mode.

798
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:29,070
你想要隐形吗
You want a stealth mode?

799
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:29,720
多酷啊  不是吗
Cool, right?

800
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,830
这主意不错  也许我会造一套
That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.

801
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,910
这主意就不好了  你在干什么
Not a good idea! What are you doing?

802
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,170
你把他的手指掰下来了
You're gonna break his finger?

803
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,520
他很痛苦  他受伤了  别动他
He's in pain, he's been injured. Leave him alone.

804
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,570
对不起
Sorry.

805
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:40,560
真的吗
Are you?

806
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,750
没事  我会修好的
Don't worry about it, I'll fix it.

807
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:46,180
那个  谁在家
So, uh, who's home?

808
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,810
我妈妈出去吃饭了
Well, my mom already left for the diner

809
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,080
我爸去7/11买刮刮乐了
and dad went to 7-Eleven to get scratchers.

810
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:54,250
我猜他中奖了  因为那是六年前的事了
I guess he won, 'cause that was six years ago.

811
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,050
很正常  好多老爸都出走
Which happens, dads leave.

812
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,180
不用那么计较
No need to be a pussy about it.

813
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,230

00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:10,980

我刚好有你需要的东西
I got just the thing.

825
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,850
这是小孩玩的彩罐  开玩笑的
This is a pinata for a cricket. I'm kidding,

826
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,610
这是很厉害的武器  别对着自己
it's a very powerful weapon. Point it away from your face,

827
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:34,100
按下上面的按钮  能吓跑欺负你的人
press the button on top. It discourages bullying.

828
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:36,900
非致命武器  只是用来脱身
Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass.

829

知道我一直在想什么吗
You know what keeps going through my head?

838
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:55,820
我的三明治呢
Where's my sandwich?

我有很多抱歉要说  但是时间有限
I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time.

842
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:45,540
首先  很抱歉让你处于危险的境地
So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way.

843
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:48,620
那很自私也很愚蠢  以后再也不会了
That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again.

844
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,160
你今晚来家里干什么
Why were you at the house tonight?

845
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,020
你有什么如此重要的事非要跟托尼说
What was so important that you had to speak to Tony?

846
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,990
我觉得我的老板效力于满大人
I think that my boss is working for the Mandarin.

847

如果你还想继续谈的话

848
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:07,480
我建议找个安全一点的地方谈
I suggest that we get ourselves someplace safe.

849
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,430
你觉得你的老板效力于满大人吗
Your boss works for the Mandarin, you think?

850
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,690
但托尼说你是个植物学家  那么
But Tony says you're a botanist, so...

851
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:15,940
难怪了  其实我是个
That figures. What I actually am is

852
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,430
一个管理四十人小组的基因编码员
a biological DNA coder running a team of forty

853
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:19,900
受雇于一个私人智囊团
out of a privately-funded think tank,

854
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,140
不过你确实可以说我是个植物学家
but sure you can call me a botanist.

855
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:26,630
你的老板  叫什么名字
This boss of yours, does he have a name?

856
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:28,750
叫阿德里奇·基里安
Yeah, Aldrich Killian.

857
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,360
我们把房子炸掉了  先生
Well, we took the house down, sir...

858
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,920
但是没有发现尸体
But there's no sign of a body.

859
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,110
-我明白了  -没找到斯塔克
- I see. - No Stark.

860
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:37,310
我得挂了
I have to go.

861
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:40,770
大师要开始录像了  他有点
The Master is about to record and he's a little...

862
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,060
你知道他的
Well, you know how he gets.

863
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:46,120
今晚的约会别忘了  完事了打给我
Keep your appointment tonight and call me when it's done.

864
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,770
好了各位  不要说话  不要看他的眼睛
Alright everybody. No talking and no eye contact,

865
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,710
除非你想被一枪崩掉
unless you wanna get shot in the face.

866
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:09,880
报告情况
Report in.

867
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:13,110
屋内安全
The house is clear.

868
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,330
大师进来了
The Master is traveling.

869
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,820
好了  我们还在等什么
Well then, what are we waiting for?

870
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,380
三明治还行  弹簧有点生锈了
The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty,

871
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,620
剩下的材料  我能凑合着用
the rest of the materials, I'll make do.

872
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,110
对了  你说你妹妹有块手表时
By the way, when you said your sister had a watch,

873
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:48,660
我没想到会这么幼齿
I was kinda hoping for something a little more adult than that.

874
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,540
她才六岁  再说这是个限量版
She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition.

875
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,580
我们什么时候能聊聊纽约的事
When can we talk about New York?

876
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,360
可能永远不会  别去想了
Maybe never, relax about it.

877
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:57,450
那复仇者联盟呢
What about The Avengers,

878
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:58,660
-能聊聊他们吗  -回头的吧
- can you talk about them? - I don't know, later.

879
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,560
孩子  让我喘口气
Hey kid, give me a little space.

880
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,620
官方说法是什么
What's the official story here?

881
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:07,670
怎么回事
What happened?

882
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:10,420
好像是个叫查德·戴维斯的人
I guess this guy named Chad Davis,

883
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,730
以前住在附近
used to live roundabouts,

884
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:15,610
在军队里获得了很多勋章
won a bunch of medals in the army.

885
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,060
有一天人们说他疯了
One day, folks said he went crazy

886
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,110
然后做了一个...炸弹
and made, you know, a bomb.

887
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,970
然后他在这里把自己炸飞了
Then he blew himself up right here.

888
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:30,740
死了六个人  对吗
Six people died, right?

889
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:31,270
是的
Yeah.

890
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:32,130
包括查德·戴维斯吗
Including Chad Davis?

891
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,120
是的
Yeah.

892
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,220
是吗  这没道理啊
Yeah. That doesn't make sense.

893
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,630
想想看  六个人死了  只有五个阴影
Think about it. Six dead, only five shadows.

894
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,480
人们说这些阴影
Yeah, people said these shadows are

895
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,770
是升入天堂的灵魂的烙印
like the mark of souls gone to Heaven.

896
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,400
除了那个人弹
Except the bomb guy,

897
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,490
他没有阴影  所以他下了地狱
he went to Hell on account of he didn't get a shadow.

898
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,100
所以只有五个
That's why there's only five.

899
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,090
你信吗
Do you buy that?

900
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,450
大家都这么说的
That's what everyone says.

901
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,860
知道这个坑让我想起什么吗
You know what this crater reminds me of?

902
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,800
不知道  我不...我不在乎
No idea. I'm not...I don't care.

903
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:18,310
那个巨大的虫洞  在纽约
That giant wormhole, in um...in New York.

904
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,910
你有同感吗
Does it remind you?

905
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:22,690
你这是想套话  我不想谈
That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.

906
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:24,820
他们会回来吗  那些外星人
Are they coming back? The aliens?

01:08:59,260 --> 01:08:59,910
你打算告诉我
So you want to tell me

1206
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:01,450
你昨晚为什么会去斯塔克大宅吗
why you were at Stark's mansion last night?

1207
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:02,690
我是想解决问题
I'm trying to fix this thing.

1208
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:05,310
我又不知道你和大师打算把那里炸掉
I didn't know you and the Master were gonna blow the place up.

1209
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:07,810
我明白了  所以你是想去救斯塔克
Oh, I see. So you were trying to save Stark,

1210
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:08,650
尽管他威胁了我们
when he threatened us.

1211
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:11,100
我说了  基里安  我们可以利用他
I told you, Killian, we can use him.

1212
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:14,880
派珀  派珀  派珀
Pepper, Pepper, Pepper.

1213
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,430
如果我们想在明年推出产品的话
Look if we wanna launch product next year,

1214
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:17,820
我需要斯塔克
I need Stark.

1215
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:21,100
他只是缺一个合适的动机  现在他有了
He just lacked a decent incentive. Now he has one.

1216
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:27,990
我是支援队B0
This is Support Team Blue Zero,

1217
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:31,300

1221
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:47,250
支援队B0
Support Blue Zero,

1222
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:49,090
除非满大人对美国的下场攻击
unless the Mandarin's next attack on the U.S.

1223
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:50,680
与廉价运动装有关
involves cheaply-made sportswear,

1224
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,440
否则我认为你们又搞错了
I think you messed up again.

1225
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,070
没错  你们自由了
Yes, you're free, uh...

1226
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:56,810
如果之前不自由的话
if you weren't before.

1227
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:58,960
当然  是  女士
It's...of course. Yes ma'am.

1228
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:01,340
钢铁爱国者执行任务  很乐意帮助您
Iron Patriot on the job. Happy to help,

1229
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:03,810
不用谢我  我很荣幸
no need to thank me, it's my pleasure.

1230
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:14,350
萨文  我拿到了爱国者战衣
Savin, I've acquired the Patriot armor.

1231
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:15,590
你想要这套战衣
You want this suit?

1232
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:18,280
你得先杀死我  把我从里面撬出来
You're gonna have to pry my cold, dead body out of it.

1233
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,830
计划就是这样的  上校
That's the plan, Colonel.

1234
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:22,540
哈里  告诉我进行的怎么样了
Harley, tell me what's happening,

1235
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:23,970
我要听详细报告
give me a full report.

1236
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,660
好的  我还在吃糖  你...
Yeah, I'm still eating that candy, do you want...

1237
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:27,680
你要我继续吃吗
do you want me to keep eating it?

1238
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,590
你吃了多少
How much did you have?

1239
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:29,570
两三盆吧
Two or three bowls.

1240
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:31,300
你还能看清吗
Can you still see straight?

1241
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:32,500
差不多
Sort of.

1242
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,500
说明你没事  电话给贾维斯
That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis.

1243
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,390
贾维斯  情况怎么样
Jarvis, how are we?

1244
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:36,420
完全没问题  先生
It's totally fine, sir.

1245
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:37,760
有一段还不错
I seem to do quite well for a stretch

1246
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,010
但在句子结尾的时候
and then at the end of the sentence

1247
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:41,200
我说错了蔓越莓
I say the wrong cranberry.

1248
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,340
还有  先生  你是对的
And, sir, you were right.

1249
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:45,030
我把AIM下行设施考虑进去后
Once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities,

1250
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:47,820
就定位到了满大人的广播信号
I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal.

1251
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:48,950
大概在哪里  远东  欧洲
What're we talkin'? Far East, Europe,

1252
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:52,140
北非  伊朗  巴基斯坦  叙利亚  在哪
North Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria, where is it?

1253
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:54,030
实际上  先生  在迈阿密
Actually, sir, it's in Miami.

1254
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:54,700
好的
Okay.

1255
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,410
孩子  我得一步步教你
Kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through

1256
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,840
重启贾维斯的语音驱动
rebooting Jarvis' speech drive,

1257
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,590
不过现在不行
but not right now.

1258
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,790
哈里  他到底在哪
Harley, where is he really?

1259
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:02,770
看一下屏幕  告诉我位置
Just look on the screen and tell me where it is.

1260
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:06,240
显示的就是佛罗里达迈阿密
It does say Miami, Florida

1261
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:08,460
好  先说重要的  我需要战衣
Okay, first things first, i need the armor.

1262
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:09,490
它现在怎么样了
Where are we at with it?

1263
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:11,100
充不了电
It's not charging.

1264
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,050
实际上  先生  是在充电
Actually, sir, it's charging,

1265
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:21,390
不过电源有问题
but the power source is questionable.

1266
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:23,850
可能无法使马克42型恢复动力
It may not succeed in revitalizing the Mark 42.

1267
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:25,500
电源有什么问题
What's questionable about electricity?

1268
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,210
好吧  这是我的战衣
Alright, it's my suit

1269
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:28,680
我不能...我不要...
and I can't... I'm not gonna...

1270
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:29,890
我不想
I don't wanna...

1271
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:33,070
-老天  又来了  -托尼
- Oh God, not again. - Tony?

1272
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,610
你又发作了吗
Are you having another attack?

1273
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:39,200
我都没提到纽约呢
I didn't even mention New York.

1274
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,020
好吧  你刚刚说出来了
Right, and then you just said it, by name,

1275
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,850
你还说你没说
while denying having said it!

1276
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:43,990
好吧
Okay...

1277
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:48,040
天啊  我怎么办
Oh, God. What am I gonna do?

1278
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,920
深呼吸  真的  深呼吸
Just breathe. Really, just breathe.

1279
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:53,510
你是机械师  对吧

1280
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:55,400
对
Right.

1281
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,780
你是这么说的
You said so.

1282
01:11:58,890 --> 01:11:59,950
对  没错
Yes, I did.

1283
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,080
那你为什么不造点东西呢
Why don't you just build something?

1284
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:16,530
好
Okay,

1285
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:18,800

我说了要调到20度
I told you to put it at sixty-eight.

1291
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:09,970
又是我的错  告诉你  亲爱的

1292
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:11,600

不过这些枪都是假的

1306

1327
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:41,230
满大人  是虚构出来的

他们找到了我来扮演这个角色

他们怎么说的  帮你戒掉吗

他需要个人

为一些"意外爆炸"负责
to take credit for some 'accidental explosions'.

是他的智囊团想出来的

01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,150
连环杀手的病态心理

1353
01:17:47,150 --> 01:17:50,610
利用了西方肖象学
The manipulation of Western iconography.

1354
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:55,170
准备好再上一课了吗  诸如此类的
Ready for another lesson? Blah blah blah.

1355
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:59,930
当然了  我的表演让这满大人栩栩如生
Of course, it was my performance that brought the Mandarin to life.

1356
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,130
你的表演
Your performance?

1357
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:03,430
还杀人呢
Where people die?

1358
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:04,860
他们没死
No, they didn't.

1359
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:06,640
看看这一切啊
Look around you,

1360
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,790
服装  绿幕
costumes, green screen.

1361
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:11,310
说实话  片子里一半的戏我都没到场
Oh, honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff.

1362
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:13,460
有我的时候  是电影特效嘛  亲爱的
When I was, it was movie magic, love.

1363
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:15,320
抱歉  不过我有个铁哥们正在昏迷中
I'm sorry,  but I got a best friend who's in a coma

1364
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,990
也许醒不过来了
and he might not wake up.

1365
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:18,220
所以你得为此负责
So you're gonna have to answer for that.

1366
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:20,590
你还是要付出代价  哥们  你明...
You're still going down, pal. You under...

1367
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:30,540
好了  特雷夫  你跟他说什么了
Okay, Trevor, what'd you tell him?

1368
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:31,560
我什么都没说
I didn't tell him anything.

1369
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:32,710
什么都没说
Nothing?

1370
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:34,750
没有
No.

1371
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:36,730
你该按应急按钮的
You should've pressed the panic button.

1372
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:39,470
我是急了会儿  但我应付下来了
Well I panicked, but then I handled it.

1373
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:53,420
好吧
Okay.

1374
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:03,980
就跟以前一样  对吧
Just like old times, huh?

1375
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:06,820
对  束线带绑着  真好玩
Oh yeah, with zip-ties. It's a ball.

1376
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,940
那不是我的主意
It wasn't my idea.

1377
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:10,940
看来你真收下了基里安的名片
Okay, so you took Killian's card.

1378
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:11,980
我拿了他的钱
I took his money.

1379
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:14,570
然后13年后  你困在这个地牢里
And here you are, thirteen years later in a dungeon.

1380
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:15,380
不是
No.

1381
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:16,470
是的
Yeah.

1382
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:18,980
不是  是你困在地牢里  我想走就能走
No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.

1383
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:19,930
好吧
Yeah.

1384
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:27,850
发生了很多事  托尼  不过我快成功了
A lot's happened, Tony, but I'm close.

1385
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:30,770
绝境病毒已经很稳定了
Extremis is practically stable.

1386
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:32,270
相信我它并没有
I'm telling you it isn't!

1387
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:33,700
我去街上看过  很多人都爆炸了
I'm on the street, people are going 'bang',

1388
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,990
溅了一墙血  玛雅  你是在欺骗自己
they're painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself.

1389
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:37,690
那就帮我修好它
Then help me fix it.

1390
01:19:39,130 --> 01:19:40,670
{\an8}你知道我是谁

1391
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:43,830
这是我写的
Did I do that?

1392
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:46,490
对
Yes.

1393
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,360
我记得那天晚上  但不记得早上了
I remember the night, not the morning.

1394
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:50,170
你就是为了这个吗
Is this what you've been chasing around?

1395
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:50,980
你不记得了
You don't remember?

1396
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:52,070
帮不了你
I can't help you.

1397
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:57,160
你以前是有道德心
You used to have a moral psychology.

1398
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:58,930
有理想
You used to have ideals.

1399
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,180
你想帮助别人
You wanted to help people,

1400
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,180
看看你现在
now look at you.

1401
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:07,240
现在每天早上陪我醒来的人
I get to wake up every morning with someone who...

1402
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,540
是有灵魂的
still has her soul.

1403
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:18,800
帮我出去
Get me out of here.

1404
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:22,300
拜托了
Come on.

1405
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:25,970
你知道我老爸以前是怎么跟我说的吗
You know what my old man used to say to me?

1406
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:29,350
他最喜欢说的一句话是
One of his favorite of many sayings,

1407
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:31,930
早起的鸟儿有虫吃
'The early bird gets the worm,

1408
01:20:31,930 --> 01:20:34,480
但是第二只老鼠有奶酪吃
but the second mouse gets the cheese.'

1409
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,740
你不是还在为瑞士的事生气吧
You're not still pissed about the Switzerland thing, are you?

1410
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:38,700
我怎么能生你的气呢  托尼
How can I be pissed at you, Tony?

1411
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:40,550
我是来感谢你的
I'm here to thank you.

1412
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:44,010
你送了我一份这辈子最棒的礼物
You gave me the greatest gift that anybody's ever given me.

1413
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,550
绝望
Desperation.

1414
01:20:46,450 --> 01:20:48,020
回想一下在瑞士的时候
If you think back to Switzerland,

1415
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:50,160
你说会去楼顶找我  是吧
you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right?

1416
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:54,620
头二十分钟
Well for the first twenty minutes,

1417
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:56,210
我真以为你会来
I actually thought you'd show up.

1418
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:58,440
接下来的一小时里
And the next hour, I...

1419
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:01,410
我考虑着
well I considered taking that

1420
01:21:01,410 --> 01:21:04,130
跨出一步  走近路去大堂
one step shortcut to the lobby,

1421
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:06,230
你明白我的意思吗
if you know what I mean.

1422
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:07,600
坦白说  我还在想
Honestly, I'm still trying to

1423
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,780
第一只老鼠发生了什么事
figure out what happened to the first mouse.

1424
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:12,300
不过当我俯瞰那座城市时
But as I looked out over that city,

1425
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:13,720
没人知道我在那里
nobody knew I was there,

1426
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:16,270
没人看得见我  甚至没人在看
nobody could see me, no one was even looking.

1427
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:20,960
我冒出了一个今后引导了我多年的想法
I had a thought that would guide me for years to come.

1428
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,220
就是隐姓埋名  托尼
Anonymity, Tony.

1429
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:27,180
多亏了你  这从此成了我的准则  对吧
Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since, right?

1430
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:30,160
你只需要在幕后运筹帷幄
You simply rule from behind the scenes.

1431
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,690
因为一旦你赋予了邪恶一副面孔
Because the second you give evil a face,

1432
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:36,190
本·拉登  卡扎菲  或是满大人
a Bin Laden, a Gaddafi, The Mandarin,

1433
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:37,610
你就给了人们一个靶子
you hand the people a target.

1434
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:38,830
你真不是一般人
You're something else.

1435
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:42,580
你已经见过他了吧
You have met him, I assume?

1436
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:44,250
是啊  影帝先生
Yeah, Sir Lawrence Olivier.

1437
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:46,450
我知道他有时候有点夸张
I know he's a little over the top sometimes.

1438
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:47,800
这不能怪我
It's not entirely my fault,

1439
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,630
他比较...他是个舞台剧演员
he has a tend...he's a stage actor.

1440
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:53,750
据说他演的李尔王在克罗伊登很受欢迎  管他呢
They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.

1441
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,830
总之  重点是
Anyway, the point is,

1442
01:21:55,830 --> 01:21:59,110
自从那个拿锤子的大块头从天而降之后
ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky,

1443
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:01,230
低调就不流行了
subtlety's kinda had its day.

1444
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:02,660
你接下来打算做什么
What's next for you in your world?

1445
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:04,690
我想回馈给你
Well, I wanted to repay you

1446
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:07,920
你曾慷慨给予我的东西
with the same gift that you so graciously imparted to me.

1447
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:16,070
绝望
Desperation.

1448
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,090
这是直播
Now, this is live.

1449
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:19,640
我不确定你是否了解状况
I'm not sure if you can tell,

1450
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,970
此刻她的身体正在试图决定
but at this moment the body is trying to decide

1451
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:25,920
是接受绝境病毒还是直接放弃
whether to accept Extremis or just give up.

1452
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,900
如果她放弃了  我只能说那场面
And if it gives up, I have to say the denotation is...

1453
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:32,580
是相当震撼的
it's quite spectacular.

1454
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:36,670
不过在做出决定之前  只有巨大的痛苦
But until that point, it's really just a lot of pain.

1455
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:41,110
我们还没讨论过薪酬呢
We haven't even talked salary yet.

1456
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:45,310
你还想要什么福利
What kind of perk package are you thinking of? Hm?

1457
01:22:45,310 --> 01:22:46,320
放开他
Let him go.

1458
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:48,820
稍等  稍等
Hold on, hold on.

1459
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:50,470
玛雅
Maya...

1460
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:52,240
我说了放了他
I said let him go!

1461
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,620
你在做什么
What are you doing?

1462
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:58,280
1200毫升  只要一半剂量就够致死了
1200cc's, a dose half of this size, I'm dead.

1463
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:02,600
总有人考验我的耐心
It's times like these my temper is tested somewhat.

1464
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,120
玛雅  把注射器给我
Maya, give me the injector.

1465
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:08,500
基里安  我要是死了你的士兵们会怎样
If I die, Killian, what happens to your soldiers?

1466
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,640
你的产品又会怎样
What happens to your product?

1467
01:23:09,650 --> 01:23:10,840
我们用不着这样  好吗
We're not doing this, okay?

1468
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:13,850
你自己会怎样  要是你过热了怎么办
What happens to you? What happens if you go too hot?

1469
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:30,980
好消息是  高层现在有一个空职了
The good news is, a high level position has just been vacated.

1470
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:41,620
你就是个疯子
You're a maniac.

1471
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:43,250
错  我是个远见家
No, I'm a visionary.

1472
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:45,800
但我手下的确有个疯子
But I do own a maniac,

1473
01:23:46,530 --> 01:23:48,570
今晚就看他的表演了
and he takes the stage tonight.

1474
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:54,000
一旦钢铁爱国者成功登机
Once we get the Patriot installed,

1475
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,790
我只要九到十分钟就能搞定
it'll take me nine...ten minutes for a take down.

1476
01:23:57,370 --> 01:23:58,090
那太好了
Well, that's great.

1477
01:23:58,090 --> 01:24:00,370
但是上一次看到它里面还有人呢
But the last time I looked there was somebody inside of it.

1478
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:07,690
下午好  先生们
Afternoon, gentlemen.

1479
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:11,980
你好  上校
Hello, Colonel.

1480
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:14,660
都让开
Step aside.

1481
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,460
我们会让你出来的  别担心
We'll get you out of there, don't worry.

1482
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,200
这样会破坏战甲的
You'll damage the armor.

1483
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:29,740
是啊
Yes, I will.

1484
01:24:31,230 --> 01:24:32,590
但你会修好的  对吗
But you can fix it, right?

1485
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:35,790
我要带战衣去基地
I'm gonna take the suit up to base camp,

1486
01:24:35,790 --> 01:24:37,420
波茨也跟我一起去
and I want Potts with me.

1487
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,080
她还在第二阶段
She's still in Phase 2.

1488
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:41,970
你听不懂我说的话吗
You're not going deaf, are you?

1489
01:24:58,070 --> 01:25:00,150
小心点  那可是限量版
Careful there, it's a limited edition.

1490
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,620
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}恶搞小马快递  一种桌游

1491
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,620
小马尾快递
Ponytail Express.

1492
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,580
田纳西离迈阿密有多远
What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?

1493
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:06,860
832英里
Eight hundred and thirty-two miles.

1494
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:08,020
非常好
Very nice.

1495
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:09,290
我比较擅长这个
I'm good like that.

1496
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:11,660
你能  把那玩意儿停掉吗
Can you, uh...stop that?

1497
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:12,870
弄坏了你就赔
Break it, you bought it!

1498
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:16,210
我赔就是了
I think I bought it.

1499
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:17,340
那可不是我的
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away.

1500
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:18,780
是我朋友的妹妹的
That belongs to my friend's sister,

1501
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:22,670
所以我等会要先杀你

别打开  别打开  别

我给你们个机会现在就逃

说实话  我讨厌在这工作
Honestly, I hate working here.

罗德  那是你穿着战衣吧
Rudy, tell me that was you in the suit.

1551
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:00,270

算是吧  尽快赶到主屋去
Kind of. Main house as fast as you can.

1553

你敢动一下我就打爆你的脸
You make a move and I'll break your face.

1559
01:29:28,630 --> 01:29:32,190
我从来不知道有人受了伤  他们骗了我
I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.

1560
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:33,760
这就是满大人
This is the Mandarin?

1561
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,870
我知道  这...太丢人了
I know, it's...it's...it's embarrassing.

1562
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,840
我是特雷夫  特雷夫·斯拉特里
Hi, Trevor. Trevor...Slattery.

1563

我知道  我本人有点矮  有点瘦
I know, I'm shorter in person, bit small,

1564
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,450
每个人都这么说  但是
everyone says that. But...

1565
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:43,040
如果你们是来抓我的
if you're here to arrest me,

1566
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,870
我乐意马上供出一些人来
there are some people who I'd like to roll on. Immediately.

1567
01:29:44,870 --> 01:29:46,230
我来跟你说明下状况  梅姨
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.

1568
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:49,050
你告诉他派珀在哪  我才会停下
You tell him where Pepper is and I'll stop doin' it.

1569

停下什么
Doing what?

1570
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:52,500
我懂了  好疼  我懂了  我懂了
Oh, I get it! Ow! That hurt! I get it! I get it!

1571
01:29:52,510 --> 01:29:54,280
我不知道派珀是谁
I don't know about any Pepper,

1572
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:56,740
-但我知道他们的计划  -快说

1573
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:58,900
你知道他们把我的战衣怎么了吗
Do you know what they did to my suit?

1574
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:02,110
什么  不  但我知道地点是在海岸
What? No. But I do know what's happening off the coast.

1575
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:05,630
跟一艘大船有关
Something to do with uh...A big boat.

1576
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:06,790
我可以带你们过去
I can take you there.

1577
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:12,730
托尼  我发誓  我一定要打烂他的脸
Tony, I swear to God. I'm gonna blow his face off.

1578
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:16,560
而且这事还跟副总统有关系
Oh, this next bit may include the Vice President as well.

1579
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:18,490
这个重要吗
Is that...is that important?

1580
01:30:18,490 --> 01:30:19,160
算是吧
Somewhat.

1581
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:20,400
挺重要的
Yeah, a little bit.

1582
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:24,440
怎么样
So?

1583
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:27,790
我们怎么办  没有交通工具
What are we gonna do? I mean, we don't have any transport.

1584
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:34,110
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}披头士成员之一

1585
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:34,110
林戈  你是不是提过有一艘不错的快艇
Ringo. Didn't you say something about a 'lovely speedboat'?

1586
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:37,320
如果他说的地点没错
If he's right about the location,

1587
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,740
我们离派珀还有20分钟的路程
we're twenty minutes from where Pepper is.

1588
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:40,890
但我们还得搞清楚副总统的事  对吧
But we also have to figure out this Vice President thing, right?

1589
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:42,910
没错  猜我正在打给谁
Right. I wonder who I'm calling right now?

1590
01:30:42,910 --> 01:30:44,310
是副总统
Oh, that's the Vice President.

1591
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:45,330
谢谢
Thanks.

1592
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:47,510
你好
Hello.

1593
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:49,550

1594
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:51,280
欢迎回到人间
Welcome back to the land of the living.

1595
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,010
我们有理由相信
We believe you're about to be

1596
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:53,430
您可能会被卷入满大人的袭击事件
drawn into the Mandarin campaign,

1597
01:30:53,430 --> 01:30:55,420
我们得尽快将您转移到安全地点
and we gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.

1598
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:57,760
斯塔克先生  我正准备在精英特工的保护下
Mr. Stark, I'm about to eat honey roast ham

1599
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,270
享用蜜汁火腿
surrounded by the agency's finest.

1600
01:31:00,270 --> 01:31:03,780
而总统和罗德上校在空军一号上
The President's safe on Air Force One with Colonel Rhodes,

1601
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:04,680
我认为我们都很安全
I think we're good here.

1602
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:06,930
先生  我是罗德上校
Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes!

1603
01:31:06,930 --> 01:31:09,270
他们打算用钢铁爱国者做木马
They're using the Iron Patriot as a Trojan Horse,

1604
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:10,600
想办法干掉总统
they're gonna take out the President somehow.

1605
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,340
我们得立刻警告机组
We have to immediately alert that plane.

1606
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:14,450
好的  我会让安保人员马上行动
Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security lock it down.

1607
01:31:14,450 --> 01:31:17,650
如果情况需要  F22战机30秒内就能就位
If need be, they can have F22s in the air in thirty seconds.

1608
01:31:17,650 --> 01:31:18,360
谢谢你  上校
Thank you, Colonel.

1609
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:19,660
罗德和斯塔克结束通话
Rhodes and Stark out.

1610
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,580
没什么问题吧  先生
Everything okay, sir?

1611
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:25,060
完全没有
Couldn't be better.

1612
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,000
我爱你  宝贝
I love you, baby.

1613
01:31:53,890 --> 01:31:57,100
罗德上校  你能过来真是太好了
Colonel Rhodes. Glad to see you could make it, son.

1614
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,470
我这就感觉安全多了
I feel safer already.

1615
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:04,610
我们得做个决定
We gotta make a decision.

1616
01:32:04,610 --> 01:32:06,780
总统和派珀只能救其一
We can either save the President or Pepper.

1617
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:07,430
没法同时救两边
We can't do both.

1618
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:09,420
先生  马里布那边有新情况
Sir, I have an update from Malibu.

1619
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:11,110
起重机总算到达了现场
The cranes have finally arrived

1620
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:13,900
正在清理地下室入口
and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak.

1621
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:15,370
我身上的战衣现在什么状态
And what about the suit I'm wearing?

1622
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:17,640
能量已经充到92%了
The armor is now at ninety-two percent.

1623
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:19,570
也只能凑合用了
That's gonna have to do.

1624
01:32:28,730 --> 01:32:30,430
他过来了  他过来了  给我来张合照
Oh, here he comes, here he comes, get a quick picture.

1625
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:31,400
没问题
Sure.

1626
01:32:48,990 --> 01:32:50,420
一切正常吧  上校
Everything all right, Colonel?

1627
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,750
真是荣幸啊  总统先生
It is an honor, Mr. President.

1628
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:27,330
你要动手  就动手吧
If you're gonna do it, do it.

1629
01:33:27,330 --> 01:33:29,490
别着急啊  先生
Cool your boots, sir.

1630
01:33:29,490 --> 01:33:31,110
这可不是满大人的作风
That's not how the Mandarin works.

1631
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:33,790
长官  空军一号陷入危急状态
Sir, Air Force One's been compromised.

1632
01:33:33,790 --> 01:33:35,710
内部发生射击  温度骤升
Internal shots, temperature spikes.

1633
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:37,000
快把画面调出来
Get me eyes on it now.

1634
01:33:37,150 --> 01:33:38,710
画面出来了  长官
Image coming through now, sir.

1635
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:42,700
那是罗德吗
Was that Rhodes?

1636
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,150
总统呢
The President.

1637
01:34:14,410 --> 01:34:15,380
快说
Now.

1638
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:16,690
他不在这里
He's not here.

1639
01:34:20,690 --> 01:34:22,040
去享受喷流吧
Try the jet stream.

1640
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:25,610
说到气流  去捞鱼吧
Speaking of which, go fish!

1641
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,400
看这个伤口还愈合得了吗  狗娘养的
Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.

1642
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:04,970
下面有多少人
How many in the air?

1643
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:06,450
13个  先生
Thirteen, sir.

1644
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:08,670
我一次能带几个
How many can I carry?

1645
01:35:08,670 --> 01:35:09,930
四个  先生
Four, sir.

1646
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:21,620
慢点  慢点  放松  你叫什么
Slow down, slow down. Relax, what's your name?

1647
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:22,670
希瑟
Heather...

1648
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:33,430
听我说  看到那个人了吗
Listen to me. See that guy?

1649
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:35,720
我会飞过去  然后你抓住他
I'm gonna swing by and you're just gonna grab him.

1650

1652
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:43,310
这样你就松不开手了
you won't be able to open your hand.

1653
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:45,610

两百英尺

1667
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:35,110
是只胖猴子  抓住他
It's a chunky monkey, let's get him.

1668
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:36,750
你好

太棒了  大家配合得很好

1671
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:06,500
贾维斯  这才算完成一半
Alright, Jarvis, but it's only half done,

1672
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:07,900
我们还得去找派珀
we still gotta get Pepp...

1673
01:37:15,310 --> 01:37:16,650
从哪冒出来的
That came out of nowhere.

1674
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:19,950
跟我说点好消息
Give me some good news, man.

1675
01:37:19,950 --> 01:37:20,770
全部获救了
I think they all made it.

1676
01:37:20,770 --> 01:37:21,800
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

1677
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,640
但是总统被抓走了
Yeah, but I missed the President.

1678
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:25,170
你有战衣都救不了总统
You couldn't save the President with the suit,

1679
01:37:25,170 --> 01:37:27,160
我们什么都没有怎么救派珀
how are we gonna save Pepper with nothing?

1680
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:29,580
贾维斯  时间到了吗
Say, Jarvis, is it that time?

1681
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:31,680
是家庭聚会规程吗  先生
The 'house party' protocol, sir?

1682
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:32,750
没错
Correct.

1683
01:38:11,950 --> 01:38:13,410
你以为他会帮你吗
You think he's gonna help you...

1684
01:38:14,990 --> 01:38:16,050
不可能
He won't.

1685
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:24,150
把你抓来不单是刺激托尼·斯塔克
Having you here is not just to motivate Tony Stark,

1686
01:38:24,150 --> 01:38:27,270
其实还有更尴尬的目的
it's um...it's actually more embarrassing than that.

1687
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:30,010
你在这里是我的
You're here as my, um...

1688
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:32,340

两年前
Well, two years ago,

1694
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:09,490
这艘驳船就是大象

1695
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,740
这是罗克森诺克号
This is the Roxxon Norco.

1696
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:13,470
你当然记得了

1697
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:16,570
它在彭萨科拉附近泄露了一百万加仑原油
that when she spilled a million gallons of crude off Pensacola,

1698
01:39:16,570 --> 01:39:19,880
拜您所赐  没有一个富人受到法庭审判
thanks to you, not one fat cat saw a day in court.

1699
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:21,200
你要我怎么样
What do you want from me?

1700
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:23,820
不怎么样  先生
Nothing, sir.

1701
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:27,440
我只是需要个在电视上处决你的好借口
I just needed a reason to kill you that would play well on TV.

1702
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,730
我已经向前看了
You see, I've moved on.

1703
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:31,510
我找到了新政治靠山
I've found myself a new political patron,

1704
01:39:31,510 --> 01:39:35,370
明天这个时候  他将接替你的职位
and at this time tomorrow, he'll have your job.

1705
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:37,530
绑起来
String him up.

1706
01:39:56,950 --> 01:39:57,850

Come on.

1707
01:40:02,210 --> 01:40:03,810
你不会突然抓狂吧
You're not gonna freak out on me, right?

1708
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:05,060
希望不会
I hope not.

1709
01:40:30,630 --> 01:40:31,830
天啊
Oh, my God.

1710
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:35,080
他被吊在油罐上面
He's strung up over the oil tank,

1711
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:36,300
他们要点火烧死他  老兄
they're gonna light him up, man.

1712

维京葬礼  公开处决

1713
01:40:38,770 --> 01:40:40,180

1718
01:40:58,790 --> 01:41:00,560
好了  我要干嘛

Stay on my six, cover high, and don't shoot me in the back.

没错  你把灯泡打爆了

1723
01:41:17,370 --> 01:41:20,190
我瞄的就是灯泡  这么远你肯定打不准
I was aiming for the bulb! You can't hit a bulb at this distance.

1724
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:25,670
我没弹药了
I'm out.

1725
01:41:25,670 --> 01:41:26,750
有多余弹匣吗
Give me...give me...you got an extra magazine?

-好吧  -再给我一个

1729

我没有适合那把枪的
I don't have one that fits that gun.

1730
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:33,020
你有五个呢  好吧
You've got like five of 'em.

1731
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:35,350
这样吧  我来侦查  准备好了吗
Alright, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna spot. Ready?

1732

你帅爆了  总统先生

不过我得要回我的战衣

宝贝  我伸不了更远
Honey, I can't reach any further,

1808
01:48:27,650 --> 01:48:28,740
你不能待在那儿  好吗
and you can't stay there, alright?

1809
01:48:28,740 --> 01:48:29,860
你得放手
You gotta let go.

1810
01:48:30,630 --> 01:48:33,020
放手  我保证能接住你
You gotta let go! I'll catch you, I promise!

1811
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:04,850
真可惜
What a shame,

1812
01:49:05,950 --> 01:49:07,180

你真的配不上她  托尼
You really didn't deserve her, Tony.

你说得对
You're right,

1825
01:51:12,790 --> 01:51:13,890
我配不上她
I don't deserve her!

1826
01:51:15,510 --> 01:51:19,230
但是你错了  她本就很完美了
Here's where you're wrong, she was already perfect.

因为我从200英尺处掉了下来

我能理解
You know, I think I understand

1852
01:54:29,610 --> 01:54:31,430
你为什么不肯放弃这些战衣了
why you don't want to give up the suits.

1853
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:33,730
我还能抱怨什么呢
What I am gonna complain about now?

我会没事吗
Am I gonna be okay?

你始于纯粹的初衷
You start with something pure,

01:56:24,450 --> 01:56:25,820
令人兴奋的想法
something exciting.

1880
01:56:26,610 --> 01:56:28,780
随之而来的是犯错
Then come the mistakes.

1881
01:56:30,070 --> 01:56:31,520
妥协
The compromises.

1882
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:40,440
我们为自己埋下祸根
We create our own demons.

It took some tinkering.

1886
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:57,040
然后我又想  何必止步于此
But then I thought to myself, "Why stop there?"

1887
01:57:01,490 --> 01:57:04,750
当然  有人会说  前进有风险
Of course, there are people who say progress is dangerous.

1888
01:57:04,750 --> 01:57:06,010
但是我敢打赌那些傻瓜
But I'll bet none of those idiots

1889
01:57:06,010 --> 01:57:08,680
不用带着一胸腔的弹片生活
never had to live with a chest full of shrapnel.

So if I were to wrap this up tight with a bow or whatever,

1896
01:59:02,970 --> 01:59:05,460
我猜我会说我的战衣
I guess I'd say my armor,

1897
01:59:06,010 --> 01:59:08,500
从不是什么消遣或爱好
it was never a distraction or a hobby,

1898
01:59:09,470 --> 01:59:10,810
而是茧
it was a cocoon.

1899
01:59:12,850 --> 01:59:17,030
现在  我破茧成蝶了

你可以拿走我的房子  花招和玩具

1907
02:09:06,780 --> 02:09:09,040
这感觉真的很棒
There's just something about getting it off my chest

1908
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:11,010
把这些话说出来
and putting it out there in the atmosphere

1909
02:09:11,010 --> 02:09:13,130
而不是憋在心里
instead of holding this in.

1910
02:09:13,130 --> 02:09:15,860
否则人会生病的  是吧
I mean, this is what gets people sick, you know?

1911
02:09:15,860 --> 02:09:19,140
我都不知道你是个这么好的倾听者

心里轻松了一半
it just cuts the weight of it in half, you know.

1915
02:09:25,320 --> 02:09:26,800
就像蛇吞食自己的尾巴
It's like a snake swallowing its own tale.

1916

一切都圆满了
Everything comes full circle.

1917
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:31,390
而且你能帮我应对...
And...and the fact that you've been able to help me process...

1918

我神游了
I... I was... I... I... I drifted.

1922
02:09:41,660 --> 02:09:42,870
你在哪睡过去的
Where did I lose you?

1923
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:46,800
瑞士的电梯
Elevator in Switzerland.

1924
02:09:47,930 --> 02:09:49,170
也就是说你什么都没听到
So you heard none of it?

1925
02:09:49,780 --> 02:09:53,440
抱歉  我不是那种医生
I'm sorry, I'm not that kind of doctor.

1926
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:55,740
我不是治疗师  这不是我的长项
I'm not a therapist, it's not my training.

1927

那个性子
Temperament.

1930
02:10:00,090 --> 02:10:01,330
其实  仔细想起来
You know what? Now that I think about it,

1931
02:10:01,330 --> 02:10:05,080
天呐  我的原始创伤是在1983年
oh, God, my original wound. 1983, alright?

1932
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:07,410
-嗯  -我都14了  还有保姆
- Yes. - I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny?

1933
02:10:07,410 --> 02:10:08,540
太奇怪了
That was weird.
