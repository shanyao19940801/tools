他好像不太高兴
He doesn't seem happy.

13
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,880
你好  汉克
Hello, Hank.

14
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,450
你应该在莫斯科
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

15
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,170
我绕了个道
I took a detour...

16
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,170
去了你的防御实验室
through your defense lab.

17
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,000
告诉我这不是我想的那个东西
Tell me that isn't what I think it is.

18
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,640
那得看你是不是认为
That depends if you think

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,900
这是意图复制我实验成果的失败品
it's a poor attempt to replicate my work.

20
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,030
就算是你们三个  这也太胆大了
Even for this group, that takes nerve.

21
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,530
你受命前往俄罗斯
You were instructed to go to Russia.

22
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,880
我需要提醒你  皮姆博士  你是名军人
May I remind you, Dr. Pym, that you're a soldier...

23
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,820
我是个科学家
I'm a scientist.

24
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,570
那就有点科学家的样子
Then act like one.

25
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,610
皮姆粒子是从古至今
The Pym Particle is the

26
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,250
最具革命性的科学发明
most revolutionary science ever developed.

27
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,510
帮我们物尽其用
Help us put it to good use.

28
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,900
我让你们把我当仆人一样使唤
I let you turn me into your errand boy,

29
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,270
可你们现在居然试图盗取我的研究
and now you try to steal my research?

30
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,670
要是当时你也像现在这么猛地保护简妮特 皮姆博士
If only you'd protected Janet with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,880
别冲动  汉克
Easy, Hank.

32
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,040
你再敢提我妻子试试
You mention my wife again

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,980
我就让你见识下什么叫猛
and I'll show you ferocity.

34
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,890
别看我  话是你说的
Don't look at me. You said it.

35
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,190
我正实提出辞职
I formally tender my resignation.

36
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,670
我们拒绝接受  正式的
We don't accept it. Formally.

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,810
汉克
Hank,

38
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,340
我们需要你
we need you.

39
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,270
皮姆粒子是个奇迹  拜托了
The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please.

40
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,670
别让你的过去决定未来
Don't let your past determine the future.

41
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,320
只要我还活着
As long as I am alive,

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,070
谁都休想得到那个公式
nobody will ever get that formula.

43
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,880
我们不该让他离开这栋楼
We shouldn't let him leave the building.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,770
你已经骗了他了
You've already lied to him.

45
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,090
现在还想跟他开战吗
Now you want to go to war with him?

46
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,070
是的
Yes.

47
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,110
我们的科学家想复制他的成果还差得远呢
Our scientists haven't come close to replicating his work.

48
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,010
他刚才已经着实地教训了你一顿
He just kicked your ass, full-size.

49
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,790
你真想体验下
You really want to find out

50
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,550
在你看都看不到他在哪时  他有多厉害吗
what it's like when you can't see him coming?

51
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,260
我认识汉克·皮姆很久了
I've known Hank Pym for a long time.

52
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,820
他不是安全隐患
He's no security risk.

53
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,440
除非我们把他逼到那步
Unless we make him one.

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,810

但我告诉你
I'll tell you what, though.

142
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,080

刚被炒了
I was. I got fired.

严格来讲  我没有打劫他们  打劫包括恐吓
Well, technically, I didn't rob them. Robbery involves threat.

当我从皮姆博士手中接管了这家公司时

如此一个革命性的想法为何会

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,140
一直被埋在汉克的众多研究中

223
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,060
积累尘土和蜘蛛网  我不得而知

他们当初就是这么称呼你的  对吧  汉克

229
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,910
有点傻  我知道
Silly, I know.

230
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,430
这只是宣传手段

汉克  可以请你告诉来宾们

我每一次问你"蚁人真实存在吗"
every single time I asked you,

235
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,160
你是怎么回答我的
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

236
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,760
这只是个传说
Just a tall tale.

237
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,600
没错
Right.

238
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,540
因为如此不可思议的事
Because how could anything so miraculous

239
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,090
怎么可能是真的
possibly be real?

240
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:20,080
我受到蚁人传说的启发
Well, I was inspired by the legend of the Ant-Man.

241
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,890
有了我缩小无机物材料的突破性进展

242
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,580
我就想  有没有可能把人也缩小呢

别说这么粗俗  弗兰克

这不是件衣服  而是个机甲

怎么了  这项发明没有打动你吗

我们本可携手完成  汉克

所以你只停留在过去  我才是未来

别这么做

How close is he?

00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,430
他还没法缩小生物
He still can't shrink a live subject.

00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,290
你就把衣服给我
Just give me the suit

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,170
我来永除后患

不行
No.

我们别无选择
We don't have a choice.

00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,060
也不尽然
Well, that's not entirely true.

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,640
生日快乐
Happy birthday!

312
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,500
非常抱歉  我迟到了
I'm so sorry I'm late.

313
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,240
我不知道聚会几点开始
I didn't know what time your party started.

314
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,960
邀请上写了时间的
It was on the invitation.

315
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,720
他都没收到邀请
He didn't get an invitation.

316
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,250
可他还是来了
But he came anyway!

317
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,380
我不会错过宝贝女儿的生日聚会
Well, I'm not gonna miss my little girl's birthday party.

318
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,050
我去告诉妈妈你来了
I'm gonna go tell Mommy you're here.

319
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:47,990
别
Oh, you don't...

320
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,310
你来这儿干什么  郎
What are you doing here, Lang?

321
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,770
你没给过孩子一分钱的抚养费
You haven't paid a dime of child support.

322
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,600
现在  只要我乐意  就可以逮捕你
You know, right now, if I wanted to, I could arrest you.

323
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,850
好像我很愿意见你似的  帕克斯顿
It's good to see you too, Paxton.

324
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,310
你能来妈妈可高兴了  她喝水都呛着了
Mommy's so happy you're here, she choked on her drink.

325
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,840
看我给你带了什么
Hey, look what I have for you.

326
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,800
我能现在就打开吗
Can I open it now?

327
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,530
当然能  宝贝儿  今天是你的生日啊
Of course, sweetheart. It's your birthday.

328
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,950
你是我最最最好的朋友
You're my bestest friend.

329
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:11,970
那是什么玩意儿
What is that thing?

330
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,960
他好丑啊
He's so ugly!

331
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,860
我爱死他了
I love him!

332
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,970
我能拿给我朋友们看吗
Can I go show my friends?

333
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,920
当然能  宝贝儿  去吧
Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead.

334
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,330
你是我最最最好的朋友
You're my bestest friend.

335
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,370
我会给孩子抚养费的
Look, the child support is coming, all right?

336
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,110
不过有了前科就很难找到工作
It's just hard finding a job when you have a record.

337
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,180
我相信你能想法解决
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

338
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:27,700
不过现在
But for now,

339
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,060
-我希望你离开我家  -不可能
- I want you out of my house. - No way!

340
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,000
这是我女儿的生日聚会
It's my daughter's birthday party.

341
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,280
-这是我家  -那又如何
- It's my house! - So what?

342
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,540
-她是我闺女  -斯科特
- It's my kid! - Scott!

343
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,930
你不能说来就来  你知道的  走吧
You can't just show up here. You know that. Come on.

344
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,950
这是生日聚会啊
It's a birthday party.

345
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,910
我知道  但你不能说来就来
Yeah, I know, but you can't just show up.

346
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,710
她是我闺女
She's my daughter.

347
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,330
你根本就不懂怎么做父亲
You don't know the first thing about being a father.

348
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,900
玛姬  看在你是我初恋
Maggie, I tell you this as a friend,

349
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,620
我们还是朋友的份上  我告诉你
and as the first love of my life.

350
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,410
你的未婚夫是个混袋
Your fiance is an asshat.

351
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,260
他不是混袋
He's not an asshat.

352
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,480
喂  嘴巴放干净点儿
Hey, watch your language. Okay?

353
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,530
哪里不干净了  我说的是袋
What language? I said "Hat."

354
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,540
别吵了
Stop it.

355
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,400
真的吗  玛姬  就他
Really, Maggie? That guy?

356
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,970
你可以嫁给任何你喜欢的人
Come on! You could marry anyone you want,

357
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,650
为什么偏要选个条子呢
and you have to get engaged to a cop?

358
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,210
至少他不是骗子
At least he's not a crook.

359
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,860
我在努力  我已经改过自新  洗手不干了
I'm trying, okay? I've changed. I'm straight.

360
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,250
我找了份工作
I had a job and...

361
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,650
我想付抚养费
I wanna provide.

362
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,560
我花了很多时间思考  现在我明白了
I had a lot of time to think about it and I love her.

363
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,300
我非常爱她
So much.

364
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,600
我错过了太多
I've missed so much time

365
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,230
我想成为她生活的一部分
and I wanna be a part of her life.

366
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,460
我该怎么做
What do I do?

367
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,990
租套公寓
Get an apartment,

368
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,130
找份工作  付抚养费
get a job, pay child support.

369
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,100
然后我们再讨论探视孩子的问题
And then we will talk about visitation, I promise.

370
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,360
你是她的英雄  斯科特
You're her hero, Scott.

371
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,040
成为她心目中的那个人吧
Just be the person that she already thinks you are.

372
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,410
弗兰克  很遗憾
I'm sorry you have such

373
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,740
你对黄衫深表担忧
deep concerns about the Yellowjacket, Frank.

374
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,890
是啊
Yeah. Well, uh...

375
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:09,410
很不幸  我们不能为所欲为
Unfortunately, we can't just do whatever we want.

376
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,110
那样就好了
It'd be nice though, right?

377
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,010
但是得遵守法则
But there are laws.

378
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,570
什么法则  人的吗
What laws? Of man?

379
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,240
自然法则高于人的法则
The laws of nature transcend the laws of man.

380
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,350
而我要高于自然法则
And I have transcended the laws of nature.

381
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,640
达伦  我觉得你不懂
Darren, I don't think you understand...

382
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,980
我们还没解决所有问题
We still haven't worked out all the bugs.

383
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,680
永别了  弗兰克
Goodbye, Frank.

384
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,550
谢谢
Thank you.

385
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,670
我最近一直在想感恩这事
You know, I've been thinking a lot about gratitude lately.

386
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,260
今天早上  我在冥想的时候
And today, during my morning meditation,

387
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,800
得出了一个有意思的结论
an interesting thought occurred to me,

388
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,530
我觉得也适用于你
and I think it might apply to you, too.

389
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,400
什么结论
How's that?

390
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,310
感恩可以是原谅
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

391
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,480
我有好几年都活在对汉克·皮姆的愤恨中
I've spent years carrying around my anger for Hank Pym.

392
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,120
我把我的才华都奉献给了他
I devoted my genius to him.

393
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,880
我本来可以去任何地方工作
I could have worked anywhere.

394
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,510
我没选好导师
I chose my mentor poorly.

395
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,010
而你甚至别无选择
You didn't even have a choice.

396
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,300
他根本就不相信你
He never believed in you.

397
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,730
之前赶你走真是不好
It's a shame what we had to do,

398
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,880
可这都是被他逼的  对不对
but he forced us to do it, didn't he?

399
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,740
但我们不该生气  我们应该感恩
But we shouldn't be angry, we should be grateful.

400
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,450
因为作为失败的导师
Because his failures as a mentor,

401
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,250
失败的父亲
as a father,

402
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,840
是他逼我们一展鸿图
forced us to spread our wings.

403
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,790
达伦  你成功了
You're a success, Darren.

404
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,580
你能获得的一切都当之无愧
You deserve everything coming your way.

405
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,230
{\an8}{\pos(194,154)} 再过377天才能见到凯西

406
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,150
别作弊了
Stop cheating.

407
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,600
回来啦  能人
Hey, what's up, hotshot?

408
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,760
他可能没听见你说话
Maybe he didn't hear you.

409
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,560
生日聚会怎么样
How was the party?

410
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,350
跟我说说那个活
Tell me about that tip.

411
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,470
什么
What?

412
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,690
我想知道你说的那个活
I wanna know about that tip.

413
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,220
宝贝儿  开工了  现在就行动
Oh, baby, it's on! It's so on, right now.

414
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,920
别激动  我就想知道消息的来源
Calm down, all right? I just need to know where it came from.

415
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,420
要绝对可靠才行
It's gotta be airtight.

416
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:45,800
好
Okay.

417
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,460
我和表兄欧内斯托一起参加一场品酒会
I was at a wine tasting with my cousin Ernesto.

418
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,450
当时大部分是红酒
Which was mainly reds,

419
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,780
你知道我不喜欢红酒
and you know I don't like reds, man.

420
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,970
但有种玫瑰葡萄酒扭转了局面
But there was a rose that saved the day.

421
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,010
那天我们很愉快
It was delightful.

422
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,360
他跟我聊起一个姑娘
And then he tells me about this girl,

423
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,840
艾米丽  她以前经常跟我们鬼混
Emily, that we used to kick it with.

424
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,110
其实那是我摸过的第一对奶
It was actually the first pair of boobs I ever touched.

425
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,970
你扯远了
It's the wrong details.

426
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,610
这跟你要讲的事毫无瓜葛
It has nothing to do with the story.

427
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,590
重讲
Go.

428
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,200
他告诉我她现在有份工作
So, uh, he tells me that she's

429
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,010
是帮别人打扫卫生
working as a housekeeper now, right?

430
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,380
她在跟一个叫卡洛斯的家伙约会
And she's dating this dude, Carlos,

431
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,340
他是海湾那头的一个大佬
who's a shot caller from across the bay.

432
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,540
她把她雇主的情况告诉了他
And she tells him about the dude that she's cleaning for.

433
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,000
他雇主是个很牛的执行总裁
Right? That he's like this big-shot CEO

434
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,150
已经金盆洗手  但是超级有钱
that is all retired now, but he's loaded.

435
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,100
卡洛斯和欧内斯托在同一个垒球队
And so, Carlos and Ernesto are on the same softball team,

436
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,650
他们有天开始聊天
and they get to talking, right?

437
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,270
好戏来了  卡洛斯说  "伙计
And here comes the good part. Carlos says, "Yo, man.

438
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,100
"有个人有个超大的保险柜
"This guy's got a big-ass safe just

439
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,320
"就放在地下室  就放在那"
"Sitting in the basement, just chilling."

440
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,360
欧内斯托当然就来找了我
Of course Ernesto comes to me because

441
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,420
因为他知道我盗窃技能了得
he knows I got mad thieving skills.

442
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,730
当然  我问了他
Of course, I ask him...

443
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,520
艾米丽告诉卡洛斯告诉你
"Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you

444
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,230
告诉我那是个什么样的保险柜了吗
"To get to me what kind of safe it was?"

445
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,680
他说  没有
And he says, "Nah, dawg.

446
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,940
她只说保险柜超赞
"All she said is that it's super-legit

447
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,330
装在里面的肯定是好东西
"And whatever's in it, it's gotta be good."

448
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,230
什么
What?

449
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,000
老头有个保险柜
Old man have safe.

450
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,790
而且他这一周不在家
And he's gone for a week.

451
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,120
好吧  有个老头  他有个保险柜
All right. There's an old man, he's got a safe,

452
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,200
而且有一周不在家
and he's gone for a week.

453
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,440
就按这个来计划
Let's just work with that.

454
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,640
我说什么来着
You know what I'm saying?

455
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,670
座机线剪了  手机信号阻断
Landline's cut, cell signal's jammed.

456
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,140
今晚没人会打求救电话
No one will be making for distress call tonight.

457
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,110
通信检查
Comm check.

458
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,530
-收到  -收到
- Check. - Check.

459
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,860
要是出了状况  还有我呢

00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,610
关键在于  这种钢不怎么耐寒

缩小有机物组织是这项技术的核心

不知道这是什么呢
I wonder... What is this?

518
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,810
从这下面看上去
The world sure seems different

519
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,850
世界还真不一样  是不是  斯科特
from down here, doesn't it, Scott?

520

什么  谁在说话
What? Who said that?

521
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,540
路易斯  我在下面
Luis, down here!

522
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,960
这是火的试炼  斯科特
It's a trial by fire, Scott. Or, in this case,

523
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,390
或者现在是放水

524
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,420
你比自己想象的要坚强

趴在地上
Get down on the ground!

00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,570
你被捕了

我刚把偷的东西还回去了

别动

我们都快相信
You know, you almost had us convinced

539
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,620
你真的改过自新了
that you were gonna change your ways.

540
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,460
她们都很看好你
They were really rooting for you.

541
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,430
这会伤透她们的心
It's gonna break their hearts.

542
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,440
你有访客
You got a visitor.

543
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,080
谁
Who?

544
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,310
你的律师
Your lawyer.

545
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,150
我的律师
My lawyer?

546
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,600
我说过我会联系你的  斯科特
I told you I'd be in touch, Scott.

547
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,970
我开始觉得
I'm starting to think

548
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,630
你更愿意待在牢房里了
that you prefer the inside of a jail cell.

549
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,710
天哪
Oh, man.

550
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,830
坐下
Sit down.

551
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,530
先生  对不起  我偷了衣服
Sir, I'm sorry I stole the suit.

552
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,510
我根本不想知道你为什么有这个
I don't even wanna know why you have it.

553
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,310
玛姬没看错你
Maggie was right about you.

554
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,690
你怎么知道
How do you know about...

555
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,040
怪不得她不让你接近凯西
No wonder she's trying to keep you away from Cassie.

556
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,350
世事开始变艰难的时候
The moment things get hard,

557
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,000
你就会回去犯罪
you turn right back to crime.

558
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,150
在我看来  你有一个选择
The way I see it, you have a choice.

559
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,290
要么在监狱里度过余生
You can either spend the rest of your life in prison,

560
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,580
要么回到你的牢房
or go back to your cell

561
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,540
等待进一步的指示
and await further instructions.

562
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,560
我不明白
I don't understand.

563
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,330
我也不指望你能明白
No, I don't expect you to.

564
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,500
但你现在没什么选择的余地
But you don't have many options right now,

565
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,960
坦白讲  我也没有
and quite frankly, neither do I.

566
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:50,030
你觉得当初
Why do you think

567
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,040
我为什么要让你偷那套衣服呢
I let you steal that suit in the first place?

568
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,110
什么
What?

569
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:07,700
第二次机会可是很难得啊
Second chances don't come around all that much.

570
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,840
所以下次你要是觉得看到了机会
So, next time you think you might see one,

571
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,240
我建议你仔细看看
I suggest you take a real close look at it.

572
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,430
你是我最最最好的朋友
You're my bestest friend!

573
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,830
你真的不想要别的玩具吗
Are you sure you don't want a different toy?

574
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,600
不  我喜欢这个
No, I love this one.

575
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:37,430
好吧  睡觉吧  我爱你
Okay. Well, get some sleep. I love you.

576
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,620
妈妈
Mommy?

577
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,070
爸爸是坏人吗
Is Daddy a bad man?

578
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,350
我听有些大人说他是坏人
I heard some grownups say he's bad.

579
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,760
不是
No.

580
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,860
爸爸有时只是有些迷茫
Daddy just gets confused sometimes, you know?

581
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,610
明智之选  你总算听进去了一回
Smart choice. You actually listened, for once.

582
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,570
从门下走
Under the door.

583
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,110
好吧  现在去哪里
Okay, where to now?

584
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,540
-稳住 -天呐
- Hang tight. - Oh, God.

585
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,040
什么  什么
What, what?

586
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,080
他跑哪儿去了
Where the hell did he go?

587
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,470
我不知道  他就那么消失了
I have no idea. He just vanished.

588
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,410
封锁周边五个街区  马上
Set up a five-block perimeter. Now!

589
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,820
退后  退后  退后
Get back! Get back! Get back!

590
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,700
-斯科特  这些是我的同伴  -什么
- Scott, these are my associates.  - What?

591
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,710
那只蚂蚁身上是背了个相机吗
Is that a camera on an ant?

592
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,090
是啊  当然了  为什么不呢
Yeah, sure. Why not?

593
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,400
车在哪
Where's the car?

594
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,060
没有车  我们用飞的
No car. We've got wings.

595
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,080
到达
Incoming!

596
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,120
把脚放在中心节点上  然后扶住胸腔
Put your foot on the central node and mount the thorax.

597
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,660
你在逗我吗
Are you Kidding?

598
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,160
-这东西安不安...  -你他妈快上去  斯科特
- How safe is... - Just get on the damn ant, Scott!

599
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,050
我为什么在一辆警车上
Why am I on a police car?

600
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,940
我难道不是不应该在警车上吗
Shouldn't I not be on a police car?

601
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,990
这样你就可以搭个顺风车
So they can give you a lift

602
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,850
通过他们五个街区的封锁
past their five-block perimeter.

603
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,350
好吧  下一步怎么办
All right. Now, what's the next move?

604
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,540
抓紧了
Hang on tight.

605
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,350
这个容易  我找到窍门了
Oh, this is easy! I'm getting the hang of this.

606
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,000
往上拉就能向上飞  就像骑马一样
Yank up to go up. It's like a horse.

607
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,950
你要让247失去平衡了
You're throwing 247 off balance.

608
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,420
等等  他的名字叫247吗
Wait, his name is 247?

609
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,370
他没有名字  只有编号  斯科特
He doesn't have a name, he has a number, Scott.

610
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:06,100
你知道一共有多少只蚂蚁吗
Do you have any idea how many ants there are?

611
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,570
也许它是...也许它是248
Maybe it's... maybe it's 248.

612
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,210
不不不不  要晕了  要晕了
No, no, no, no! Vertigo, vertigo!

613
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,250

停下来  247  打住  打住
Stop, 247! Time out, time out.

621
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,570
不玩了
Time out.

假如我吐在了头盔里会发生什么
What happens if I throw up in this helmet?

这是我的头盔  斯科特  别吐里面
It's my helmet, Scott. You do not throw up.

看我睡觉吗
watching me sleep, this whole time?

Yes.

我可以破坏掉服务器
I could take down the servers

克洛斯不会发现的
and Cross wouldn't even know it.

我们不需要这个人
We don't need this guy.

我猜你已经见过我女儿霍普了
I assume that you've already met my daughter, Hope.

她不认为我们需要你
She doesn't think that we need you.

你通过我的安保系统的方式
how you managed to get past my security system.

冰冻金属那招尤其聪明
Freezing that metal was particularly clever.

673

你当时在看着我吗
Were you watching me?

Right. But how do you make them do that?

690
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:58,140
我用电磁波
I use electromagnetic waves

来刺激它们的嗅觉神经中枢

什么
Huh?

00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,480
我得知了如何改变原子间的距离
I learned how to change the distance between atoms.

707
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,110
那就是那件衣服的动力
That's what powers the suit.

708
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,650
它运作的原理
That's why it works.

00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,360
但这是很危险的
But it was dangerous.

710
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,440
过于危险了
It was too dangerous.

711
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,710
所以我将它藏起来了
So I hid it from the world.

712
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,390
从那时我便另起炉灶  开了自己的公司

我收了个年轻的学徒  名叫达伦·克洛斯
I took on a young protege called Darren Cross.

达伦·克洛斯
Darren Cross.

00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,170
他可是个大人物啊
He's a big deal.

718
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,810
但在他成为大人物之前  他是我的助手
But before he was a big deal, he was my assistant.

719
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,770
我觉得自己看中了他的某些特质
I thought I saw something in him.

720
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:16,820
甚至把他当自己儿子了吧
The son I never had, perhaps.

721
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,430
他很有才华  但当我们关系越来越近时
He was brilliant, but as we became close,

722
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,770
他开始怀疑我有事没告诉他
he began to suspect that I wasn't telling him everything.

723
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:27,140
他听到了关于皮姆微粒的传言
He heard rumors about what was called the Pym Particle,

724
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,190
从此开始着了魔般地想重现我的公式
and he became obsessed with recreating my formula.

725
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,760
但我不愿意帮他
But I wouldn't help him.

726
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,260
所以他背叛了我
So he conspired against me

727
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,880
投票把我赶出了我自己的公司
and he voted me out of my own company.

728
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,230
他是怎么做到的
How could he do that?

729
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,210
董事会的主席是我的女儿  霍普
The board's chairman is my daughter, Hope.

730
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,910
她投了决定性的一票
She was the deciding vote.

731
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,750
但当她看到克洛斯差不多就要
But she came back to me

732
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:48,750
重现我的公式时  她回到了我身边
when she saw how close Cross was to cracking my formula.

733
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,960
这整个过程非常的不稳定
The process is highly volatile.

734
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:55,160
假如没戴着特制的头盔
If one isn't protected by a specialized helmet,

735
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,240
有可能会影响到大脑的作用
it can affect the brain's chemistry.

736
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,280
我不认为达伦知道这一点
I don't think Darren realizes this,

737
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:03,610
再说了  他自己也没有多稳定
and, you know, he's not the most stable guy to begin with.

738
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:06,490
所以  你想要我做什么
So, what do you want from me?

739
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:12,500
斯科特  我相信人人都该有赎罪的机会
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption.

740
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,470
你相信吗
Do you?

741
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,610
相信
I do.

742
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:17,010
假如你能帮我的话
If you can help me,

743
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,870
我保证能帮你重新回到你女儿身边
I promise I can help you be with your daughter again.

744
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,350
现在  你准备好自我救赎了吗
Now, are you ready to redeem yourself?

745
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:25,950
百分百好了
Absolutely.

746
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,590
我那些入室盗窃的日子一去不复返了
My days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done.

747
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:32,210
您要我做什么
What do you want me to do?

748
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:35,830
我要你入室并且盗窃
I want you to break into a place and steal some shit.

749

并且毁掉所有数据
and destroy all the data,

765
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:10,220
否则达伦·克洛斯就要掀起世界动乱了
Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world.

766
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:17,250
我觉得首先我们应该去向复仇者们求助
I think our first move should be calling the Avengers.

767
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,420
我花了大半辈子
I spent half my life

768
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:23,650
努力不让这项科技落入斯塔克手中
trying to keep this technology out of the hands of a Stark.

769
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,040
我现在也绝不会亲手把它交过去
I'm sure as hell not gonna hand-deliver it to one now.

770
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:30,580
这可不是钢铁侠战衣那种小儿科
This is not some cute technology like the Iron Man suit.

771
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,840
这个能改变现实的结构
This could change the texture of reality.

772
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,520
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}影射复联2剧情

773
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,520
再说了  他们八成正忙着把城市从天上往下扔呢
Besides, they're probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky.

774
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,330
好吧  那你为何不直接派蚂蚁去呢
Okay, then why don't you just send the ants?

775
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,710
斯科特  它们只是蚂蚁
Scott, they are ants.

776
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:47,110
蚂蚁  它们能做很多事
Ants, they can do a lot of things,

777
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:49,360
但它们依然需要个领头的
but they still need a leader.

778
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,930
需要某人能渗透进
Somebody that could infiltrate a place

779
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:54,810
某个被设计成无法渗透的地方
that's designed to prevent infiltration.

780
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:56,660
汉克  我是个贼  明白吗
Hank, I'm a thief, all right?

781
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,450
我是说  我是个很厉害的贼
I mean, i'm a good thief,

782
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:58,570
但这个也太疯狂了
but this is insane.

783
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,410
他说得对  汉克  你自己也清楚
He's right, Hank. And you know it.

784
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,770
你见过影像画面了
You've seen the footage,

785
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,820
你知道克洛斯能干出些什么来
you know what Cross is capable of.

786
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:05,850
我几个月前就反对用他
I was against using him when we had months,

787
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:07,500
而如今我们只有几天了
and now we have days.

788
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,680
我来穿那套衣服
I'm wearing the suit.

789
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,160
绝对不行
Absolutely not!

790
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,010
我了解那栋建筑的里里外外
I know the facility inside and out.

791
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:13,220
我了解克洛斯的想法
I know how Cross thinks.

792
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,930
我比任何人都了解这项任务
I know this mission better than anybody here.

793
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:15,930
我们需要你待在克洛斯身边
We need you close to Cross.

794
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,470
不然的话  这项任务没办法成功的
Otherwise, this mission cannot work.

795
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,190
我们没时间胡闹了
We don't have time to screw around!

796
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:20,110
霍普  拜托听我说...
Hope, please listen to me...

797
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,720
他是个罪犯  我是你女儿
He is a criminal! I'm your daughter.

798
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,690
不行
No!

799
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,680
她说得对  汉克
She's right, Hank.

800
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,520
我不是你要找的人
I'm not your guy.

801
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,880
你为什么不自己穿呢
Why don't you wear the suit?

802
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:09,770
你以为我不想吗
You think I don't want to?

803
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,480
我是不能穿
I can't.

804
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,700
我穿过好几年
I spent years wearing it,

805
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,360
而这衣服对我产生了不良影响
and it took a toll on me.

806
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,930
你是唯一的人选
You're our only option.

807
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:34,790
在霍普失去她母亲前
Before Hope lost her mother,

808
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:38,790
她曾经视我为世界上最伟大的人
she used to look at me like I was the greatest man in the world.

809
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,170
而如今她看着我  眼中只剩下失望
And now she looks at me and there's just disappointment.

810
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,780
对我而言已经太迟了
It's too late for me,

811
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,820
但你不一样
but not for you.

812
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,330
这是你的机会
This is your chance.

813
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,170
重新赢得你女儿眼中的崇拜的机会
The chance to earn that look in your daughter's eyes.

814
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:02,000
不要辜负你在她心中的英雄形象
To become the hero that she already thinks you are.

815
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,880
这无关拯救我们的世界
It's not about saving our world.

816
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:08,440
而是事关拯救她们的
It's about saving theirs.

817
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:13,490
靠  这番话说得真好
Damn. That was a good speech.

818
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,430
斯科特
Scott,

819
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:19,750
我需要你成为蚁人
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

820
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,540
正确地使用它
In the right hands,

821
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,880
人和衣服之间就会是一种共生关系
the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic.

822
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,600
衣服有力量  人则是利用那种力量
The suit has power. The man harnesses that power.

823
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:34,520
你需要变得灵巧  敏捷  最重要的是
You need to be skillful, agile, and above all,

824
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,960
你得要快
you need to be fast.

825
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:38,240
你要能够在极短的时间内缩小
You should be able to shrink and grow

826
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:39,300
和变大
on a dime.

827
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,820
让你的体型总能配合你的行动
So your size always suits your needs.

828
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,630
现在  穿过那个钥匙孔  斯科特
Now dive through the keyhole, Scott.

829
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,000
你起跑时是大的
You charge big,

830
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,090
然后变小穿过
you dive small,

831
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:50,700
之后再变大
then you emerge big.

832
00:49:58,330 --> 00:49:59,450
废物
Useless.

833
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:02,970
当你变小时  力量就被压缩了
When you're small, energy's compressed,

834
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,800
所以你180斤的男性的力量
so you have the force of a 200-pound man

835
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,120
放在了0.25毫米大的拳头后
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide.

836
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,380
你就像是一颗子弹
You're like a bullet.

837
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,000
你出拳太重了  会把人杀死
You punch too hard, you kill someone.

838
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,900
太轻了  就会像是爱抚
Too soft, it's a love tap.

839
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,370
换句话说  你得懂得如何出拳
In other words, you have to know how to punch.

840
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:15,260
在我监狱里待了三年  我知道怎么出拳
I was in prison for three years. I know how to punch.

841
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,140
打给我看看
Show me.

842
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:17,760
真差劲
Terrible.

843
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:19,020
你想要给我演示一下如何出拳吗
You wanna show me how to punch?

844
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,190
打吧
Show me...

845
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,410
这样出拳才对
That's how you punch.

846
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:25,620
她一直等着这个呢
She's been looking forward to this.

847
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,530
真是呢
No kidding.

848
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:29,220
霍普在一段困难时期学会了武术
Hope trained in martial arts at a difficult time.

849
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,500
他说的"困难时期"是指我妈妈去世的时候
Oh, by "difficult time," he means when my mother died.

850
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,370
她死于一场坠机事故
We lost her in a plane crash.

851
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,210
你不愿告诉我她是怎么去世的就够糟了
It's bad enough you won't tell me how she died.

852
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,370
你能不能别再重复那个谎言了
Could you please stop telling me that lie?

853
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:38,540
我们在干正事呢
We're working, here.

854
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:44,230
好了  小公主  我们归回正题吧
All right, princess. Let's get back to work.

855
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,370
你刚是想打手吗
Were you going for the hand?

856
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:55,180
我觉得这个调节器碍着我了
You know, I think this regulator is holding me back.

857
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:57,770
别乱动那个调节器
Do not screw with the regulator.

858
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:59,950
假如那个调节器坏了
If that regulator is compromised,

859
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,730
你会变成亚原子级
you would go subatomic.

860
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,020
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

861
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,010
意思是你会进入一个量子界
It means that you would enter a quantum realm.

862
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:06,910
那又是什么意思
What does that mean?

863
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:08,910
意思是你会进入一个现实
It means that you would enter a reality

864
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,150
在那里一切关于时间和空间的概念
where all concepts of time and space

865
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:13,550
都没有意义了
become irrelevant

866
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:16,190
因为你会不断缩小
as you shrink for all eternity.

867
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:20,790
你所知和所爱的一切
Everything that you know and love

868
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,020
都将一去不复返
gone forever.

869
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:27,500
棒  要是没坏的话
Cool. Yeah, if it ain't broke...

870
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,160
你对衣服已经有所了解
You've learned about the suit,

871
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,040
但你还没了解你最好的伙伴
but you've yet to learn about your greatest allies,

872
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,640

879
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,790
你也没那么狂嘛

880
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:55,100

未来实验室有独立的供电设备

886
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,810
然后关掉安保系统

00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:28,330

施密特疼痛指数第一位

汉克想让你出去做目标训练

红盘缩小

00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:44,720
蓝盘放大
Blue enlarges.

915
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:49,020
火蚁
Solenopsis mandibularis.

916
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,200
咬人是出了名的
Known for their bite,

917
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,310
但火蚁们也是出色的建筑师
the fire ants have evolved into remarkable architects.

918
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:57,360
他们能帮你自由进出险境
They are handy to get you in and out of difficult places.

919
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,680
你能做到的  斯科特  加油
You can do it, Scott. Come on.

920
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:12,780
他们不听我指挥
They're not listening to me.

921
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,330
你得认真  专心注意力集中
You have to commit. You have to mean it.

922
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,550
不要走捷径  不要撒谎
No shortcuts, no lies.

923
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,660
羞辱他只会乱上加乱
Throwing insults into the mix

924
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,300
对任何人都没有好处  霍普
will not do anyone any good, Hope.

925
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,890
我们没时间惯着他了
We don't have time for coddling.

926
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,340
我们重点是要帮助斯科特
Our focus should be on helping Scott!

927
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:27,200
是吗
Really?

928
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,370
我们的重点就是这个吗
Is that where our focus should be?

929
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:55,540
霍普
Hope!

930
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:06,970
我不知道为什么要来找你帮忙
I don't know why I came to you in the first place.

931
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:18,050
我们没她成不了
We can't do this without her.

932
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,960
老天
Oh, God.

933
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:25,760
你得关好车门
You gotta lock your doors.

934
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:28,890
说真的  这片有很多怪人
I mean, really, there's some weird folks in this neighborhood.

935
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:30,290
你觉得这都是玩笑吗
Do you think this is a joke?

936
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,160
你知道他让你冒了多大的风险
Do you have any idea what he's asking you to risk?

937
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,310
你有个女儿
You have a daughter.

938
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:36,730
我做这些也是为了她
I'm doing this for her.

939
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:40,190
我妈妈去世时  我两周没见到他人
You know, when my mother died, I didn't see him for two weeks.

940
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,440
他肯定很伤心
He was in grief.

941
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,980
我也是  我当时才七岁
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

942
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:45,580
然后他再也没回来  没有真正回来
And he never came back. Not in any way that counted.

943
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,290
他直接把我送到寄宿学校
He just sent me off to boarding school.

944
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,110
要知道  我以为
You know, I thought,

945
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,100
这次危机
with all that's at stake,

946
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,070
可能是我们重归于好的机会
just maybe we might have a chance of making peace.

947
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:58,520
可事到如今他还是对我拒之千里
But, even now, he still wants to shut me out.

948
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,200
他不是想拒绝你  他信任你
He doesn't wanna shut you out. He trusts you.

949
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,660
那要你来干什么
Then why are you here?

950
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,570
来证明他爱你
It proves that he loves you.

951
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,550
霍普  看着我
Hope. Look at me.

952
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:11,110
我是来当炮灰的
I'm expendable.

953
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:13,260
找我就是为了这个
That's why I'm here.

954
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:16,550
你现在应该也意识到了
You must have realized that by now.

955
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:19,550
这就是为什么是我穿那套衣服而不是你
I mean, it's why I'm in the suit and you're not.

956
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,640
他宁愿全盘皆输也不愿意失去你
He would rather lose this fight than lose you.

957
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:26,660
所以说
Anyway...

958
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,800
我打电话报警的时候
You know, I didn't know you had a daughter

959
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:33,630
不知道你有个女儿
when I called the cops on you.

960
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:38,580
她叫什么
What's her name?

961
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,510
凯西
Cassie.

962
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:42,830
很美的名字
It's a pretty name.

963
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,090
你得整理思绪  斯科特
You have to clear your mind, Scott.

964
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:49,800
想法一定要明确
You have to make your thoughts precise.

965
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,080
这就是其中原理
That's how it works.

966
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,430
想想凯西
Think about Cassie.

967
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:57,860
想想你有多想见她  靠这个集中精力
About how badly you want to see her. And use that to focus.

968
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,530
睁开眼睛
Open your eyes

969
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:11,700
想想你想要蚂蚁们怎么做
and just think about what you want the ants to do.

970
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:35,090
做得好
That's good!

971
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,910
你母亲说服我
Your mother convinced me

972
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:59,070
让她也加入我的任务
to let her join me on my missions.

973
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:02,040
他们叫她黄蜂女
They called her the Wasp.

974
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:04,150
她手到擒来
She was born to it.

975
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:08,540
之后没有哪一天
And there's not a day that goes by

976
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,990
我不在后悔当初答应了她
that I don't regret having said yes.

977
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:18,070
那是1987年
It was 1987.

978
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:23,340
分裂派在苏联库斯科劫持了一个导弹发射井
Separatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

979
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:27,920
并向美国发射了一枚洲际导弹
and launched an ICBM at the United States.

980
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:37,910
进入导弹内部的唯一方式
The only way to the internal mechanics

981
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,660
就是穿过固态钛
was through solid titanium.

982
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:51,020
我知道我得缩小到
I knew I had to shrink

983
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:54,260
比分子还小  才能解除导弹
between the molecules to disarm the missile.

984
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,220
但我的调节器受损太重
But my regulator had sustained too much damage.

985
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:00,570
你母亲
Your mother,

986
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,590
没有丝毫犹豫
she didn't hesitate.

987
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,020
简妮特  不要
Janet! No!

988
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,920
她关掉了她的调节器
She turned off her regulator

989
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,140
缩小到亚原子级
and went subatomic

990
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,430
解除了炸弹
to deactivate the bomb.

991
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:24,580
她牺牲了
And she was gone.

992
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,530
你妈妈是个英雄
Your mom died a hero.

993
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,330
接下来的十年时间
And I spent the next 10 years

994
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:41,090
我试图了解量子领域的一切
trying to learn all I could about the quantum realm.

995
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:46,480
你想把她找回来
You were trying to bring her back.

996
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:51,800
但我只了解到我们有多无知
But all I learned was we know nothing.

997
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:58,340
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

998
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,190
是她自己的选择
She made her choice.

999
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:10,240
但你为什么不早点告诉我
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

1000
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,800
我是想保护你
I was trying to protect you.

1001
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:18,040
我已经失去了你母亲
I lost your mother.

1002
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,970
我不想也失去你
I didn't mean to lose you, too.

1003
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:25,300
对不起
I'm sorry.

1004
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:29,860
好棒
This is awesome.

1005
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,640
真的好棒
It's awesome, you know?

1006
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:35,150
你俩终于解除隔阂  重归于好
You guys are breaking down walls, you're healing.

1007
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:36,980
这很重要
It's important.

1008
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,920
我把气氛毁了  是不是
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

1009
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:43,540
没错  的确
Yes, you did. Yes.

1010
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,010
我去泡点茶
I'm going to make some tea.

1011
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,300
搞定
Nailed it!

1012
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:04,680
好样的  安东蚁
That's a good boy, Ant-thony.

1013
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,420
你训练的最后阶段是潜入
The final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion.

1014
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:38,580
好冷
It's freezing!

1015
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,900
你不能在衣服里加层绒吗
You couldn't make a suit with a flannel lining?

1016
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:44,850
你得拿到这个信号诱饵的原型机
You must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy.

1017
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:47,480
我当年还在神盾局的时候研发的
It's a device that I invented during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

1018
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,610
我们要用它来干扰
We need it to counteract the transmission blockers

1019
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:51,790
克洛斯在未来保险库装的通讯拦截器
that Cross installed in the Futures vault.

1020
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:55,000
现在正在霍华德·斯塔克的
It's currently collecting dust in one of Howard Stark's

1021
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,550
纽约州北边的一个仓库积灰呢
old storage facilities in upstate New York.

1022
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:59,780
应该是小菜一碟
Should be a piece of cake.

1023
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:01,310
你在目标区域上空了
You're over the target area.

1024
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,920
现在出发  斯科特
Disengage now, Scott!

1025
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,260
A中队  走
Squadron A, go!

1026
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,710
B队  走
B, go!

1027
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:09,900
C队  走
C, go!

1028
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:13,580
好了  安东蚁  这次别再把我甩下去了
All right, Ant-thony, please don't drop me this time.

1029
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:17,280
从搬糖块到干这个差距也太大了
Oh, it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this!

1030
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,430
保持冷静
Stay calm.

1031
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,570
伙计们  我们可能有麻烦了
Guys? We might have a problem.

1032
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,640
汉克  你不是说是个旧库房吗
Hank, didn't you say this was some old warehouse?

1033
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:27,540
它不是
It's not!

1034
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,170
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch!

1035
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:34,460
-斯科特  快回来  -任务中止
- Scott, get out of there. - Abort!

1036
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,590
立刻中止
Abort now!

1037
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,140
没事  看着不像有人在
No, it's okay. It doesn't look like anyone's home.

1038
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:40,380
安东蚁  飞到屋顶去
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

1039
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:42,770
他要把衣服搞丢了
He's gonna lose the suit.

1040
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:44,440
他命都要丢了
He's gonna lose his life.

1041
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:52,090
好了  我到目标建筑的屋顶了
All right, I'm on the roof of the target building.

1042
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:54,950
有人在  斯科特
Somebody's home, Scott.

1043
01:02:58,190 --> 01:02:59,390
山姆  下面出什么事了
What's going on down there, Sam?

1044
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:00,640
是猎鹰
It's the Falcon!

1045
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:03,550
感应器说这里有东西  但我什么都没看到
I had a sensor trip but I'm not seeing anything.

1046
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:04,890
等等
Wait a second.

1047
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:06,980
任务中止  斯科特  立刻中止
Abort, Scott! Abort now!

1048
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:08,650
没事的  他看不到我
It's okay. He can't see me.

1049
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:09,850
我看得到你
I can see you.

1050
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:10,990
他看得到我
He can see me.

1051
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,360
你好  我是斯科特
Hi. I'm Scott.

1052
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,930
他刚直接自报家门了吗
Did he just say, "Hi, I'm Scott"?

1053
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:17,790
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

1054
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:20,240
首先  我是你的粉丝
First off, I'm a big fan.

1055
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,390
谢谢  你谁啊
Appreciate it. So, who the hell are you?

1056
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:24,060
我是蚁人
I'm Ant-Man.

1057
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,430
"蚁人"吗
"Ant-Man"?

1058
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:26,880
怎么  没听过我大名吗
What? You haven't heard of me?

1059
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,220
不  你是该没听过我
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.

1060
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:31,210
你要说明你是来干什么的吗
You wanna tell me what you want?

1061
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:33,650
我想过来拿个仪器
I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology.

1062
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:35,370
借用几天  用完就还
Just for a few days. I'm gonna return it.

1063
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:38,190
我得拿去拯救世界  你懂的
I need it to save the world. You know how that is.

1064
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,020
我确实懂
I know exactly how that is.

1065
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:41,590
锁定入侵者
Located the breach.

1066
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:43,410
-马上逮捕他  -对不住了
- Bringing him in. - Sorry about this!

1067
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:49,560
你他妈在干什么
What the hell are you doing?

1068
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:53,370
入侵者为成年男性
Breach is an adult male,

1069
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:55,420
好像有某种缩小装置
who has some sort of shrinking tech.

1070
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:08,940
抱歉
Sorry!

1071
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,250
听着  我真的很抱歉  对不起
Look, I'm sorry about this. Sorry.

1072
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,080
够了
That's enough!

1073
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:37,210
安东蚁  帮下忙
Ant-thony! A little help!

1074
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,210
我看不见你了
I've lost visual.

1075
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:01,850
他在我的翅膀里
He's inside my pack!

1076
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:02,750
抱歉
Sorry!

1077
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:05,710
你看起来人很好
You seem like a really great guy.

1078
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:34,650
这事绝对不能被队长知道
It's really important to me that Cap never finds out about this.

1079
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:41,140
你刚那也太不负责而且很危险
That was completely irresponsible and dangerous!

1080
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,340
你威胁到了全盘计划
You jeopardized everything!

1081
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,190
你拿到了
You got it.

1082
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:05,960
干得好
Well done.

1083
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:06,910
等一下
Wait a minute.

1084
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:08,540
你刚是在表扬我吗
Did you just compliment me?

1085
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,530
他表扬我了  是吧
He did, didn't he?

1086
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:11,000
听起来是的
Kind of sounded like he did.

1087
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,520
我以前很厉害吧
I was good, wasn't I?

1088
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:19,000
还有我跟一个复仇者干了一架还没死
Hey, how about the fact that I fought an Avenger and didn't die?

1089
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,550
别沉溺于往事
Let us not dwell on the past.

1090
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:23,780
还得完成计划
We gotta finish our planning.

1091
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,600
别在意他
Don't mind him.

1092
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:29,660
你做得很好
You did good.

1093
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:37,850
达伦
Darren.

1094
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:42,250
你是怎么进来的
How the hell did you get in here?

1095
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:45,870
前门没锁  汉克
You left the front door open, Hank.

1096
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:47,530
这回是真的了
It's official.

1097
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:48,720
你老了
You're old.

1098
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:49,990
计划图纸
The plans.

1099
01:06:51,770 --> 01:06:53,120
他会杀了他
He will kill him.

1100
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:59,180
你有何贵干
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?

1101
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:01,880
我有好消息
I have good news.

1102
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:02,860
是吗
Really?

1103
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:04,980
是什么
What's that?

1104
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:09,790
皮姆科技  你一手建立的公司
Pym Tech, the company you created,

1105
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,520
马上要成为世界上
is about to become one of the most

1106
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,250
效益最好的机构了

1107
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:18,230
光是明天的买卖就能赚150亿
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales, tomorrow alone.

1108
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:25,840
不用谢了
You're welcome.

1109
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:32,770
我知道很奇怪  但我想你也在场
I know this is odd, but I'd like you to be there.

1110
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,340
那是我的时刻  我想让你也看到
This is my moment. I want you to see it.

1111
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:37,990
好的  达伦  可以
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

1112
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:39,100
我会到场的
I'll be there.

1113
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:57,630
你看中我什么了
What did you see in me?

1114
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:00,170
我不懂你什么意思
I don't know what you mean.

1115
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,400
多年以前  你选中了我
All those years ago, you picked me.

1116
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:05,200
你看到了什么
What did you see?

1117
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:09,420
我看到了我自己
I saw myself.

1118
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:11,820
那你为什么又把我推开
Then why did you push me away?

1119
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:17,220
因为你太像我了
Because I saw too much of myself.

1120
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:29,780
他知道了  那是陷阱
He knows. He's baiting you.

1121
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:31,340
我们得中止计划
We have to call it off.

1122
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:32,890
我们都在冒险
We're all taking risks.

1123
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:34,030
要是他看到我在这里怎么办
What if he saw me here?

1124
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:35,310
他没看到的  没有可能
He didn't. There's no way.

1125
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:36,840
你怎么能确定
How do you know that?

1126
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:41,090
{\an8}{\pos(188,112)}达伦·克洛斯

1127
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:46,440
达伦  你好
Darren, hi.

1128
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,590
霍普  你现在在哪
Hope, where are you right now?

1129
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:51,620
我在家  怎么了
I'm at home. Why?

1130
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:52,900
我刚去见汉克了
I just saw Hank.

1131
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:55,080
他还是和以前一样轻视我
I still get nothing but contempt from him.

1132
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:58,610
别跟他生气  他就是个糟老头
Don't let him rile you up. He's just a senile old man.

1133
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,100
所有人都要加班加点的工作
We need to start everyone working around the clock.

1134
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,060
马上准备运行生产线
Get the assembly line up and running.

1135
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,870
我要加强警备
And I'm tripling security.

1136
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:06,810
所有入口都要设感应器
Full sensors at all entrances

1137
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:10,160
通风口都装上钢制微孔筛
and exterior air vents fitted with steel micro-mesh.

1138
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,940
好的  好主意
Great. Good idea.

1139
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:15,080
谢谢你  霍普  有你在我这边真幸运
Thank you, Hope. I'm so lucky to have you on my team.

1140
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:22,970
他要加强警备  他已经疯了还盯上你了
He's tripling security. He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

1141
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:25,200
但他没有盯上你
But he is not onto you.

1142
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,690
他要在所有入口加装人体扫描仪
He's adding full body scanners to all entrances

1143
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:29,640
还要关闭外部通风口
and closing exterior vents.

1144
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:31,500
斯科特怎么进去
How are we gonna get Scott inside?

1145
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:34,440
总水管
The water main.

1146
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,800
你没法加强总水管的安保措施
You can't add security to a water main.

1147
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:40,100
水压太强了  但要是我们能减弱水压
The pressure is too strong, but if we can decrease it,

1148
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,210
我就能进去
that's how I get in.

1149
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:43,690
得有人在大楼的控制中心
Somebody would have to reach the building's control center

1150
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:45,000
去调节水压
to change the water pressure.

1151
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,420
我和汉克得陪在克洛斯身边
Hank and I will be beside Cross.

1152
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:47,690
我们根本不可能做到
How are we supposed to do that?

1153
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:49,410
我们要招兵买马了
So we expand our team.

1154
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:51,140
需要哪些人呢
What do we need?

1155
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:52,980
内部要安插一名假保安
A fake security guard on the inside

1156
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,430
负责进入供水系统降压
to de-pressurize the water system,

1157
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:58,070
另一个人要侵入供电系统切断激光光束
somebody else to hack in to the power supply and kill the laser grid,

1158
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,590
还要一个人接应我们逃跑
and a getaway guy.

1159
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:04,620
不不不  那三个蠢货不行  绝对不行
No, no. No, no, no. Not those three wombats. No way.

1160
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:06,540
谢谢您的咖啡  女士
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.

1161
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:10,120
很少会有人被打劫了还邀请劫匪坐坐
It's not too often that you rob a place and then get welcomed back.

1162
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,710
因为我们打劫了你
Because we just robbed you.

1163
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:17,540
你知道他是因为偷了台冰沙机被捕的吧
You know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie machine, right?

1164
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,680
是两台冰沙机
Two smoothie machines.

1165
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,120
你确定他们能胜任吗
Are you sure they can handle this?

1166
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,810
肯定可以  我们可是专业的
Oh, we can handle it. We're professionals.

1167
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:25,630
请原谅我们对你们没什么信心
You'll forgive us if we're not instilled with confidence.

1168
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:28,250
各位都先冷静一下  淡定淡定
Well, hey, everybody just kick back and relax a little bit, man.

1169
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:29,630
我们懂这行
We know our business.

1170
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:32,180
我们可闯入过这老房子  不是吗
We broke into this spooky-ass house, didn't we?

1171
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:33,380
是我放你们进来的
I let you.

1172
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:36,680
那也可以说是我让你放我进来的
Well, one could say that I let you let me.

1173
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,370
没事  他们能搞定
Look, it's okay. They can handle this.

1174
01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:40,260
对  我们能搞定
Yeah, we can handle it.

1175
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:42,200
-你有他们的证件了吗  -他在系统里了
- You got their credentials? - He's in the system.

1176
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,400
我在系统里了
I'm in the system?

1177
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:44,850
你在系统里了
You're in the system.

1178
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,060
系统里吗
The system?

1179
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:48,280
好吧  我们死定了
Yeah, we're doomed.

1180
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:51,250
好了  有样东西要给你们看看
All right. There's something you guys need to see.

1181
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,110
等你走到这个转角
When you get to this corner,

1182
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:56,250
你的左侧会有三间办公室
there's gonna be three offices on your left side.

1183
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:57,300
我操
Damn!

1184
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:01,840
真是太酷炫了  哥们
Whoa! That's so cool, bro!

1185
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,430
听着  过一会儿会很诡异
Now, look, this is gonna get weird, all right?

1186
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:06,430
会很吓人  但其实没事
It's pretty freaky, but it's safe.

1187
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:07,930
不必害怕
There's no reason to be scared.

1188
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,560
不不  老子我天不怕地不怕
Oh, no, no. Daddy don't get scared.

1189
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:11,090
-真的吗  -真的
- Really? - Yeah.

1190
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,100
那就好
Good.

1191
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,400
绝对是吉普赛人搞的鬼把戏
This is the work of Gypsies.

1192
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,670
这是巫术吧
That's witchcraft.

1193
01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:23,920
太厉害了
Wow, that's amazing.

1194
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,160
感觉就像大卫·科波菲尔那样
That's like some David Copperfield shit.

1195
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,280
这是什么魔法吧
That's some kind of wizardry.

1196
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,400
是巫术
This is sorcery!

1197
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,430
哥们  你是怎么做到的
How'd you do that, bro?

1198
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:32,160
千万别怕  看看你的肩膀
Don't freak out. Look at your shoulder.

1199
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:35,100
滚开  滚开
Get off! Get off!

1200
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,170
你不是还说你天不怕地不怕吗
Wait, I thought Daddy didn't get scared!

1201
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:41,260
我让每人吃了半片镇静剂
I gave them each half a Xanax

1202
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:43,760
汉克还给他们解释这套衣服的原理呢
and Hank explained the science of the suit to them.

1203
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:45,300
他们就睡着了
They fell right asleep.

1204
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:49,140
听着  我很感谢你能...
Hey, look, I wanna thank you for...

1205
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:50,390
不  别谢我
No, please don't.

1206
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:54,070
我们这么做都是为了大义
We're all doing this for reasons much bigger than any one of us.

1207
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:55,130
我只是很高兴你还有
I'm just glad that you might have

1208
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:57,800
那么一丝机会可能会成功
a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.

1209
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,250
谢谢你为我打气
Hey, thank you, you know, for that pep talk.

1210
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,200
老实说  我已经从原来的瞧不起你
You know, the honest truth is, I actually went from despising you

1211
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,130
变得快开始喜欢你了
to almost liking you.

1212
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:07,300
你真的应该去写诗
You really should write poetry.

1213
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,130
去睡会吧  斯科特
Get some sleep, Scott.

1214
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:03,890
好了  确定一下
All right, just so we're clear,

1215
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:05,650
我们都清楚自己的任务了吧
everyone here knows their role, right?

1216
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:07,270
-戴夫  -负责驾车逃跑
- Dave? - Wheels on the ground.

1217
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:08,770
-科特  -负责搞定监控
- Kurt? - Eyes in the sky.

1218
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:10,240
-路易斯  -你懂的

1219
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,730
没错  我要穿制服
You know what? I get to wear a uniform.

1220
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:13,300
-就是这样  -路易斯

1221
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,630
抱歉  我清楚任务  我只是太兴奋了
I'm sorry. I'm good. I'm good. I'm just excited.

1222
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:16,790
而且你的女朋友真的很性感
Plus, your girlfriend's really hot.

1223
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:18,350
看到她我也会特别紧张
So, you know, that makes me nervous, too.

1224
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:19,560
你真的很漂亮  女士
And you are very beautiful, ma'am.

1225
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:21,110
-我的天哪  -她不是我的...
- Oh, my Lord. - She's not my...

1226
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:22,570
对了  我想到个策略
You know what? I was thinking of a tactic,

1227
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:24,040
我卧底进去时可以用
like when I go undercover.

1228
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,220
比如吹口哨  你懂我的意思吧  融入进去
Like a whistling. You know what I'm saying? To like, blend in.

1229
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:28,740
不行  别吹口哨  不准吹
No. Don't whistle. No whistling.

1230
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:31,130
这又不是表演才艺节目  不准吹
It's not The Andy Griffith Show. No whistling.

1231
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:50,300
一区一切正常
All clear in Sector One.

1232
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:56,430
进来
Step out.

1233
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:00,190
没问题
All clear.

1234
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,030
准备就绪
We're set.

1235
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:08,660
祝我好运
Wish me luck.

1236
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,040
设备上线
Utilities online.

1237
01:14:34,730 --> 01:14:36,420
你在干什么
Hey! What are you doing?

1238
01:14:36,990 --> 01:14:41,240
头儿让我来检查下这  我就来了
Uh... Boss-man said to secure the area, so I'm securing it.

1239
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:44,230
我就是头儿
I'm the boss.

1240
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:46,630
控制室1.3
Utilities 1.3...

1241
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,220
水位正在下降
Water level is dropping!

1242
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:32,460
爬到抽气管上
Coming up on extraction pipe.

1243
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:34,310
我看到了
All right, I see it.

1244
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:43,340
拜托了  我得爬上去
All right, come on, I gotta get up there.

1245
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:46,170
没错  没错  就是这样
That's it. That's it, guys! Yes!

1246
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:51,430
没错  我们做到了  做到了  快点
Yes! You got it! You got it! Come on!

1247
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:58,220
好了  起飞吧  安东蚁
All right, let's fly, Ant-thony.

1248
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:11,430
蚁人进入大楼了
The Ant-Man is in the building.

1249

皮姆刚到  时间正好
Pym's pulling up. Right on time.

1250
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:18,230
外面还有辆福特皇冠
Got a Crown Vic right outside there.

1251
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:19,410
有什么问题吗
This is problem?

1252
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:21,770
福特皇冠是卧底警察
Considering the Crown Vic's the most commonly used car

1253
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:23,540
最常开的车
for undercover cops, man,

1254
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:25,450
没错  出问题了
yes, this is problem.

1255
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,480
是皮姆
That's Pym.

1256
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:34,040
不
Oh, no.

1257
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,510
我在部署子弹蚂蚁
I'm deploying the bullet ants.

1258
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:37,340
拟猛蚁亚科什么什么蚁
Paraponera clavata de Merna Merna...

1259
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:39,860
不记得学名叫什么  但这人惨了
I don't remember what it's called, but I feel bad for this guy.

1260
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:53,440
瞧瞧  这还差不多
See? That's what I'm talking about.

1261
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,250
这就是我所说的在严肃的
That's what I call an unfortunate casualty

1262
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:58,000
行动中不幸的受害者
in a very serious operation.

1263
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,930
信号诱饵就位
Signal decoy in place.

1264
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:12,290
凶巴巴美女也搞定了  斯科特
Mean, pretty lady did good, Scott.

1265
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:15,830
看来皮姆被逮捕了
Looks like Pym's getting arrested.

1266
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:17,390
斯科特  出问题了
Scott, we have problem.

1267
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,190
问题  什么问题
Problem? What's the problem?

1268
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:22,880
戴夫  戴夫  我们可没这计划
Dave! Dave, that's not part of plan!

1269
01:17:22,890 --> 01:17:23,810
听我说
Listen to me.

1270
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:27,960
如果我不进这大楼  有人就会死
If I don't get into this building, people will die.

1271
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,720
有那么夸张吗
That's awfully dramatic.

1272
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:34,730
是不是在逗我
Are you kidding me?

1273
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,660
问题解决了
Problem solved.

1274
01:17:58,880 --> 01:17:59,940

终于来了
There he is.

1276

刚刚好  走吧
Just in time. Come on.

01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,940
十二项验证
12-point verification.

1278
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:29,110
有点过头了  你不觉得吗  达伦
Little over-the-top, don't you think, Darren?

1279
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:30,350
正在确认授权
Confirming authorization level.

1280
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:32,170

You really did it.

1284
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:46,850
这还只是一部分  汉克
And you only know the half of it, Hank.

1285
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:14,820
前往第二目标位置

1286
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,310
全速前进  安东蚁  冲吧

1288

好了  各位  我到了
All right, guys. I'm in position.

1290
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:56,140
我要给蚂蚁们发指令了
I'm gonna signal the ants.

1291
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:57,770
不不不
No, no, no, no, no!

1292
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:00,910
你看到了吗
Did you see that?

1293
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:08,680
各就各位
Assume formation.

1294
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:10,930
好了  你们这些可爱的小家伙
All right, you cute little crazies,

1295
01:20:10,930 --> 01:20:12,700
烧坏这些服务器吧
let's fry these servers!

1296
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:26,830
上吧兄弟们
Let's go get 'em, buddy!

1297
01:20:39,730 --> 01:20:40,950
服务器已被毁坏
Servers are fried.

1298
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:43,010
备份数据均已被擦除
Data backup completely erased.

1299
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:44,700
正在前往粒子实验室
Heading to the particle chamber.

1300
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:53,090
你好  克洛斯博士
Hello, Dr. Cross.

1301
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:59,560
我的伙伴们答应了你的条件
My associates have agreed to your terms.

1302
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,630
太好了
Wonderful.

1303
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:03,120
卡森先生向这几位先生引荐了我
Mr. Carson introduced me to these fine gentlemen here.

1304
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,110
他们是九头蛇的代表们
They're representatives of Hydra.

1305
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,600
他们不是曾经那样了
They're not what they were.

1306
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,280
他们正在进行有趣的工作
They're doing some interesting work.

1307
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:10,510
而我也很享受这样
And I'm enjoying myself.

1308
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:14,400
你一直把技术藏起来不给我
You tried to hide your technology from me.

1309
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,050
现在你自食恶果了吧
And now it's gonna blow up in your face.

1310
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:25,470
我早就预料到你会出拳揍我
I mean, I saw that punch coming a mile away,

1311
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:27,860
可我还以为这一拳会很软弱无力呢
but I just figured it'd be all pathetic and weak.

1312
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:29,510
那你想错了
Well, you figured wrong.

1313
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:31,770
我见过这辆车
I know this van.

1314
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:34,590
有人吗
Anybody home?

1315

1321
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:35,900
-快了  -并没搞定

1322
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:38,030
-马上就好了  -并没有
- I'm getting close! - No, you're not.

1323
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:43,740
旧金山警察局
San Francisco P.D.!

1324
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:45,080
从车里出来
Out of the van!

1325
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:46,550
我知道你们在里面
I know you're in there!

1326
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:47,330
再快点
Make it go faster.

1327
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:49,160
哥们  别再催我了
Dude, seriously.

1328
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,630
准备跃入  听到没  科特
Ready to jump. Do you read, Kurt?

1329
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,310
马上就好
So close.

1330
01:22:58,370 --> 01:22:59,810
-等等  再等一会  -别动
- Okay, hold up! Wait a minute! - Freeze!

1331
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:01,340
有个和我长得一模一样的黑人
There was a black guy that looked exactly like me

1332
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:03,550
袭击了我们  把我们关进这破车里
who attacked us and put us in the back of this disgusting van.

1333
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:05,210
-给我出来  -我这不是在出来嘛
- Get out of the van! - Okay, I'm coming.

1334
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:06,340
别紧张
Take it easy!

1335
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,700
我不走  快上
No, I will not move! Go now!

1336
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:11,720
等等
Wait!

1337
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,480
什么  为什么又要等等
What? What do you mean, "Wait"?

1338
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:24,970
搞什么
What? What?

1339
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:27,630
小家伙
Hey, little guy.

1340
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:43,440
我一直都怀疑你还偷藏了一套衣服
I always suspected you had a suit stored away somewhere.

1341
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:44,680
那么问题来了
Which begs the question,

1342
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,960
这位新蚁人是谁
who is the new Ant-Man?

1343
01:23:47,090 --> 01:23:50,890
这位让我敬爱的导师更加信任的人是谁
Who is the man that my beloved mentor trusted even more than me?

1344
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:55,830
斯科特·朗
Scott Lang.

1345
01:23:57,010 --> 01:23:58,560
殉道者
A martyr

1346
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,180
反抗了社会也付出了代价
who took on the system and paid the price,

1347
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:05,250
失去了他的家庭和他唯一的女儿
losing his family and his only daughter in the process.

1348
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:08,050
正好是你的口味  汉克
Exactly your kind of guy, Hank!

1349
01:24:09,390 --> 01:24:14,750
他越了狱  没有留下任何线索
He escapes his jail cell without leaving any clue as to how.

1350
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:18,440
然后神奇地消失了
And then he disappears magically,

1351
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,360
虽然身上一分钱都没有
despite having no money to his name.

1352
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,770
现在他把蚁人服带来了
And now he brings me the Ant-Man suit.

1353
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:30,490
唯一能与我的发明相提并论的设计
The only thing that can rival my creation.

1354
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:33,600
达伦  别这么做
Darren, don't do this.

1355
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:35,940
如果你把它卖给这些人
If you sell to these men,

1356
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:37,530
一定会引发世界混乱
it's gonna be chaos.

1357
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:39,010
我已经卖了
I already have.

1358
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:40,470
而且多亏了你
And for twice the price,

1359
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:41,570
卖了两倍的价格
thanks to you.

1360
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:45,890
要成功侵入复联大楼可不容易
It's not easy to successfully infiltrate an Avengers facility.

1361
01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:48,500
庆幸的是  消息传千里
Thankfully, word travels fast.

1362
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,820
我会把黄衫卖给他们
I'll sell them the Yellowjacket,

1363

不过粒子我就自己留着了

如果想要燃料  就得来找我
If you want the fuel, you'll have to come to me.

1366
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,340
你会怎么称呼全世界

你走火入魔了  我能帮你  把枪放下
You're sick and I can help you. Just put the gun down.

我当时还没想杀你
I wasn't ready to kill you then,

1385
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:06,280

你会没事的
All right? You're gonna be just fine.

1393
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:47,050
把衣服脱了  不然我一枪崩了你再扒衣服
Take the suit off, or I'll blow your brains out and peel it off.

01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:21,220
你会变成亚原子级
You would go subatomic.

1515
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:22,890
不
Oh, no.

1516
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:36,880
你会进入一个现实
You would enter a reality

1517
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:42,300
在那里一切关于时间和空间的概念
where all concepts of time and space...

1518
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:43,600
没有意义了
become irrelevant...

1519
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:46,730
都没有意义了
become irrelevant...

1520
01:40:48,530 --> 01:40:51,780
一切关于时间和空间的概念都没有意义了
all concepts of time and space become irrelevant...

1521
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:58,120
爸爸  回来
Come back, Daddy!

1522
01:40:59,430 --> 01:41:05,000
因为你会不断缩小
as you shrink for all eternity...

1523
01:41:07,830 --> 01:41:09,330
你所知
Everything that you know

1524
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:13,090
和所爱的一切
and love,

1525
01:41:14,910 --> 01:41:15,890
都将一去不复返
gone forever.

1526
01:41:15,890 --> 01:41:19,130
爸爸  你在哪里
Daddy, where are you?

1527
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:38,700
你在哪里
Where are you?

1528
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:42,450
你在哪里啊
Where are you?

1529
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:45,580
-爸爸  -凯西
- Daddy! - Cassie.

1530
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:54,860
爸爸  回来
Come back, Daddy!

1531
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:01,850
不要乱动调节器
Do not screw with the regulator!

1532
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:33,720
爸爸
Daddy!

1533
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:38,780
我好爱你
I love you so much.

1534
01:42:39,170 --> 01:42:40,400
我也爱你
I love you, too.

1535
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:42,260
很爱很爱
So much.

1536
01:42:46,570 --> 01:42:48,690
房顶上有个大洞
You know, there's a big hole in the roof.

1537
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:52,440
抱歉
Sorry.

1538
01:42:55,610 --> 01:42:57,470
-她没事吧  -嗯  她没事
- Is she all right? - Yeah, she's fine.

1539
01:42:59,530 --> 01:43:00,500
妈妈
Mommy!

1540
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:05,430
她没事  她没事
She's fine, she's fine.

1541
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:15,760
拜托  斯科特
Scott, please.

1542
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:18,490
你什么都不记得了吗
You don't remember anything?

1543
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:20,260
汉克  我记不得了
Hank. I don't.

1544
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:21,920
肯定还有些什么的
There must be something else.

1545
01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:26,310
好吧  我觉得人类的大脑
Well, I suppose the human mind

1546
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:29,860
是没法理解这种经历的
just can't comprehend the experience,

1547
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:33,180
但你却成功了
but you made it.

1548
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:35,040
你进去以后
You went in,

1549
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:38,540
又出来了
and you got out.

1550
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:42,160
真棒
It's amazing.

1551
01:43:43,130 --> 01:43:44,090
斯科特
Scott,

1552
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:46,130
我带你出去
I'll walk you out.

1553
01:43:50,980 --> 01:43:52,100
好好休息
Get some rest.

1554
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:02,260
这真的有可能吗
Is it possible?

1555
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:21,730
什么时候的事
When did this happen?

1556
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:23,140
没什么事
Nothing's happening.

1557
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:25,580
等等  算是有点什么事吧
Whoa. Hold on. Something's kind of happening.

1558
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:27,640
要真是这样
Well, if that's the case,

1559
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:28,930
再给我来一枪
shoot me again.

1560
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:30,690
我不知道你刚在干嘛
Yeah. I don't know what you were doing,

1561
01:44:30,690 --> 01:44:32,030
对我又抱又亲的
grabbing and kissing me like that.

1562
01:44:32,030 --> 01:44:33,960
我也有点小惊讶呢
I'm a little surprised myself.

1563
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:36,690
我得去个地方  一会见  汉克
I have to get somewhere. I'll see you later, Hank.

1564
01:44:36,690 --> 01:44:37,720
霍普  你真是的
Really, Hope.

1565
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:39,810
斯科特
Scott.

1566
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:42,670
-满嘴胡话  -没错
- You're full of shit. - Oh, yeah.

1567
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:45,730
斯科特  我今天见了我们警监
Scott, I met with my captain today.

1568
01:44:45,730 --> 01:44:48,300
他想要你出狱那晚的报告
He wanted a report on the night that you got out of jail.

1569
01:44:49,290 --> 01:44:50,880
摄像头出现了故障
Something happened with the cameras.

1570
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:53,670
一些电路被烧坏了
Some circuits got fried.

1571
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:57,170
但我跟他说你是走正规程序出去的
But I told him that you were processed correctly.

1572
01:44:57,420 --> 01:44:58,290
真的吗
Really?

1573
01:44:58,680 --> 01:44:59,560
是的
Well, yeah.

1574
01:45:01,010 --> 01:45:04,810
不能因为电子故障就把凯西的爸爸送回监狱  对吧
Can't be sending Cassie's dad back to jail on a technical glitch, right?

1575
01:45:04,810 --> 01:45:05,960
谢谢你  帕克斯顿
Thank you, Paxton.

1576
01:45:06,490 --> 01:45:07,620
我太感动了
I'm blown away.

1577
01:45:09,030 --> 01:45:10,710
谢谢你为凯西所做的一切
Thank you for everything you do for Cassie.

1578
01:45:10,710 --> 01:45:13,130
不甚荣幸
Well, that's my pleasure.

1579
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:16,760
不过这次  我是为了你
But, no. This one, I did for you.

1580
01:45:19,420 --> 01:45:20,290
好尴尬
This is awkward.

1581
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:21,790
-没错  -没错
- Yeah.  - Yeah.

1582
01:45:21,860 --> 01:45:24,330
这事之后我们还有什么可谈的呢
I mean, what do we even talk about after all of that?

1583
01:45:24,330 --> 01:45:25,690
-我知道  -什么
- Oh, I know. - What?

1584
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:27,590
我今天第一次横翻筋斗
I did my first cartwheel today.

1585
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:28,330
什么
What?

1586
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:30,730
没错  她练了一个星期了
Yeah. She has been practicing all week.

1587
01:45:30,730 --> 01:45:31,580
今天真是见证奇迹的时刻
But today was the magic day.

1588
01:45:31,590 --> 01:45:34,310
我用手机录下来了  看
I recorded it on my phone. Here.

1589
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:37,640
不  这不可能是凯西  这不是你
No, that can't be Cassie. That's not you.

1590
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:38,590
是她
Yeah, it is.

1591
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:41,220
这分明是专业体操运动员  不可能是你
This is a professional gymnast. There is no way that's you.

1592
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:42,620
的确就是她
Yeah, that's her.

1593
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:45,250
好狗狗
Good boy.

1594
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:49,430
亲爱的  真的太棒了
Sweetie, that's pretty amazing, peanut.

1595
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:53,410
抱歉
Sorry.

1596
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:56,190
工作上的事
It's work.

1597
01:46:01,130 --> 01:46:01,720
好的
All right.

1598
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:03,480
这样吧  把事实告诉我
Here's the deal. Just give me the facts.

1599
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:05,110
讲重点  只讲重点
Just the facts. Only the facts.

1600
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:08,580
呼气  专注  简简单单
Breathe. Focus. Keep it simple.

1601
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:10,570
行  行  没问题的
No, no, no. No doubt, no doubt. Okay.

1602
01:46:10,570 --> 01:46:13,140
我和我表哥伊格纳西奥去艺术馆
So, I'm at this art museum with my cousin Ignacio, right?

1603
01:46:13,150 --> 01:46:15,200
是一个抽象表现主义的展览
And there was this, like, abstract expressionism exhibit.

1604
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:17,490
但你知道的  我比较喜欢新立体主义的作品
But you know me, I'm more like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right?

1605
01:46:17,490 --> 01:46:20,530
但有个人叫罗斯科的人非常棒  天呐
But there was this one Rothko that was sublime, bro! Oh, my God!

1606
01:46:20,530 --> 01:46:21,660
路易斯
Luis.

1607
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:22,750
好了  抱歉  抱歉
Okay, sorry. Sorry.

1608
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:24,900
我就是太兴奋了
You know, I just get excited and stuff.

1609
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:26,690
但不管怎么说  伊格纳西奥告诉我
But anyway, Ignacio tells me,

1610
01:46:26,690 --> 01:46:28,320
"我昨晚在焦点酒吧
"Yo, I met this crazy-fine writer chick

1611
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:30,370
遇到一个超正点的作家妹子  超级正点
at the Spot last night. Like fine-fine.

1612
01:46:30,370 --> 01:46:31,920
特别特别正点  然后他
Like crazy-stupid fine." And he

1613
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:33,040
过去跟酒保说
goes up to the bartender and goes,

1614
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:34,590
看那个和我一起的妹子  懂我意思不
"Look at the girl I'm with. You know what I'm sayin'?

1615
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:35,680
她超正的  对吧
"She's crazy-stupid fine, right?"

1616
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:38,830
酒保说  是啊  的确超正
The bartender's all like, "Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."

1617
01:46:38,830 --> 01:46:40,840
所以这个作家妹子告诉伊格纳西奥
So this writer chick tells Ignacio,

1618
01:46:40,850 --> 01:46:43,680
我可是小道八卦界女王
"Yo, I'm like a boss in the world of guerrilla journalism,

1619
01:46:43,690 --> 01:46:45,660
我和幕后大佬关系可好了
"And I got mad connects with the peeps behind the curtains,

1620
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:46,420
你懂我说得不
"You know what I'm saying?"

1621
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:47,990
伊格纳西奥就问  真的呀
Ignacio's like, "For real?"

1622
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:49,580
她说  真的啊
And she's like, "Yeah, you know what,

1623
01:46:49,580 --> 01:46:50,850
我不能告诉你我线人是谁
I can't tell you who my contact is,

1624
01:46:50,850 --> 01:46:52,700
因为他和复联一起工作
"Because he works with the Avengers."

1625
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:53,900
天呐
Oh, no.

1626
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:56,500
这人听上去很厉害呢
Yeah, and this dude sounds like a badass, man.

1627
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:57,620
他走过去跟她说
Like, he comes up to her and says,

1628
01:46:57,620 --> 01:46:59,500
"我在找个超级英雄界的新人
"Yo, I'm looking for this dude who's new on the scene,

1629
01:46:59,510 --> 01:47:00,960
"刚初来乍到
"who's flashing his fresh tack,

1630
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:03,540
"技能出众的人  你知道谁吗"
"who's got, like, bomb moves, right? Who you got?"

1631
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:05,640
她说  什么人都有啊
And she's like, "Well, we got everything nowaday.

1632
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:06,760
有会蹦的
We got a guy who jumps.

1633
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:09,160
会飞的  还有爬墙的
"We got a guy who swings, we got a guy who crawls up the walls.

1634
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:10,220
你得说具体点
"You gotta be more specific."

1635
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:12,620
他说  我要找个能缩小的
And he's like, "I'm looking for a guy that shrinks."

1636
01:47:12,620 --> 01:47:14,530
我说  靠  我很紧张
And I'm, like, "Damn!". I got all nervous

1637
01:47:14,530 --> 01:47:16,190
因为我要为你保守秘密
'cause I'd keep mad secrets for you, bro.

1638
01:47:16,190 --> 01:47:17,290
所以我问伊格纳西奥
So I asked Ignacio,

1639
01:47:17,290 --> 01:47:19,450
"那个狠角色是不是让超正作家找你
"Did the badass tell the stupid-fine writer chick

1640
01:47:19,450 --> 01:47:21,830
让你来找我  因为我和他要找的
to tell you to tell me, because I'm tight with Ant-Man,

1641
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:23,130
那个蚁人关系很好吗
"That he's looking for him?"

1642
01:47:23,740 --> 01:47:26,220
然后呢  他说什么
And? What'd he say?

1643
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:31,070
他说  没错
He said, "Yes."

1644
01:48:41,490 --> 01:48:41,530
{\an8}{\pos(192.5,224)}蚁  人

1645
01:48:41,530 --> 01:48:41,570
{\an8}{\pos(192.5,188)}蚁  人

1646
01:48:41,570 --> 01:48:41,610
{\an8}{\pos(192.5,180)}蚁  人

1647
01:48:41,610 --> 01:48:41,660
{\an8}{\pos(192.5,169)}蚁  人

1648
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:41,700
{\an8}{\pos(192.5,167)}蚁  人

1649
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:41,740
{\an8}{\pos(192.5,165)}蚁  人

1650
01:48:41,740 --> 01:48:41,780
{\an8}{\pos(192.5,164)}蚁  人

1651
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:41,820
{\an8}{\pos(192.5,163)}蚁  人

1652
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:41,860
{\an8}{\pos(192.5,162)}蚁  人

1653
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:41,910
{\an8}{\pos(192.5,161)}蚁  人

1654
01:48:41,910 --> 01:48:44,160
{\an8}蚁  人

1655
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:44,660
{\an8}蚁  人

1656
01:49:26,370 --> 01:49:28,060
我想给你看个东西
There's something I want to show you.

1657
01:49:30,590 --> 01:49:34,100
力量是无法摧毁的
I realized you can't destroy power.

1658
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:39,450
只能尽量不被歹人触及
All you can do is make sure that it's in the right hands.

1659
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:48,280
这个升级版原型衣
This is an advanced prototype

1660
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:51,120
是我和你母亲一同研发的
that your mother and I worked on together.

1661
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:54,730
她都没有机会用
She never got to use it.

1662
01:49:55,960 --> 01:50:00,540
但我现在明白了  这是我们为你造的
But now I realize that we were... We were working on it for you.
