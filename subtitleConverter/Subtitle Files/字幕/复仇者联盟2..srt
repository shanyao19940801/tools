伤亡人数就要加倍了

我的挚友可能要成为一段宝贵的回忆了

托尔 报告一下浩克的战果

斯特拉克 什么时候能实现人体强化了
Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement.

斯科维亚过去战乱不断

222
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,720
没什么特别的地方 不过...它的一切都将变得特别

223
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,000
他们的能力呢
Their abilities?

224
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,280
男的加快了新陈代谢
He's got increased metabolism

225
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,960
提升了体内热能稳定性
and improved thermal homeostasis.

226
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,200
女的通过神经电接触 能心灵遥感

00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,650
男的快 女的怪
He's fast and she's weird.

229
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,560
好吧 他们肯定会再出现的

230
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,600
同意 资料说他们自愿
Agreed.File says they volunteered

231
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,520
参加斯特拉克的试验
for Strucker's experiments.

232
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,520
- 真是疯了 - 是啊
- It's nuts. - Right.

233
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,840
什么怪胎为了保卫国家
what kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them

234
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,200
会让德国科学家在自己身上做实验呢
to protect their country.

235
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,080
我们在战争时期 队长
We're not at war, Captain.

236
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,920
他们是
They are.

237

他怎么样
How's he doing?

238
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,800
很不幸 他还是巴顿
Unfortunately, he's still Barton.

239
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,200
太糟了
That's terrible.

240
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,930
他没事 只是口渴
He's fine, just thirsty.

241
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,930
好了 别睡了 贾维斯 游戏时间到了
Alright, look alive Jarvis. It's playtime.

242
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
我们只有几天时间和这根棒子相处
We only got a couple of days with this joystick,

243
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,080
所以要充分利用时间

244
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,760
告诉我结构和成分分析结果
Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.

245
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
权杖来自外星
The scepter is alien.

246
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,080
包含我无法量化的元素
There are elements I can't quantify.

247
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,610
所以还是有可以量化的
So there's elements you can.

248
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
宝石像是防护罩
The jewel appears to be a protective housing

249
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,320
保护着里面的东西
for something inside.

250
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,770
那东西非常强大
Something powerful.

251
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,960
类似反应堆
Like a reactor?

252
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,320
像是计算机
Like a computer.

253
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,600
我相信我能解码
I believe I can cypher the code.

254
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,490
你确定他会没事吗
You sure he's gonna be okay?

255
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,160
假装我们需要这家伙 这样还真能让大家团结一点
Pretending we need this guy really brings the team together.

256
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,760
他的伤情不会再恶化了
There's no possibility of deterioration.

257
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,040
纳米分子的功能会在瞬间起作用

258
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,200
他的细胞不会意识到它们在和幻影结合
His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum

259
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,160
她在制造组织
She's creating tissue.

260
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,690
要是在我的实验室
If you brought him to my lab,

261
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,400
再生摇篮只用20分钟就够了
the regeneration cradle could do this in 20 minutes.

262

噢 他心电图成直线了 宣布死亡时间吗
Oh, he's flat-lining. Call it... time?

263
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,000
不不不 我将要永生了
No, no, no, I'm gonna live forever.

264
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,690
我将要变成塑料人
I'm gonna be made of plastic.

265
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,130
你的饮料
Here's your beverage.

266
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,960
你不会有任何改变 巴顿先生
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton

267
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,690
连你的女朋友都看不出来有任何差别
Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.

268
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,920
我没有女朋友
I don't have a girlfriend.

269
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,320
这我可解决不了
That, I can't fix.

270
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,120
这是科技的未来 托尼
This is the next thing, Tony.

271
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,440
你那老式笨重的金属盔甲要下岗了
Your clunky metal suits are gonna be left in the dust.

272
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,200
就是这么计划的
That is exactly the plan.

273
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,000
我和希尔希望你来参加星期六的派对
And Hill and I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.

274
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,560
我可不像你 我没那么多时间参加派对
Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.

275
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,800
托尔会去吗
Will... Thor... be there?

276
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,320
- 什么动静 - 是权杖
- What's the rumpus? - Well, the scepter.

277
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,120
我们一直在琢磨 斯特拉克怎么才能如此有创造力
You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive.

278
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,160
所以我一直在分析宝石内部
So, I've been analyzing the gem inside.

279
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,680
你可能认得出来...
You may recognize...

280
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,520
- 贾维斯 - 博士
- Jarvis? - Doctor.

281
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,600
一开始 贾维斯只是个自然语言界面
Started out, Jarvis was just a natural language UI

282
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,840
现在他掌管钢铁军团
Now he runs an Iron Legion.

283
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,520
他掌管的事务比谁都多
He runs more of the business

284
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,000
- 除了小辣椒
- than anyone besides Pepper. - Oh.

285
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,240
- 堪称一流 - 是啊
- Top of the line. - Yes.

286
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,640
但我不再是了
I suspect not for long.

287
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,920
来看看竞争对手
Meet the competition.

288
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,200
- 很漂亮 - 要是让你猜
- It's beautiful. - If you had to guess,

289
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,320
- 它像是在做什么 - 像是在思考
- what's it looks like its doing? - Like it's thinking.

290
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,880
你是说这可能是...
I mean, this could be...

291
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,400
这... 这不是人类的思维
It's... it's not a human mind.

292
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,520
看看这
I mean look at this.

293
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,880
就像是神经元正在放电
They're like neurons firing.

294
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,560
在斯特拉克的实验室里 我看到了一些非常高级的机器人
Down at Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work.

295
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,250
他们清空了数据
They deep sixed the data

296
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,480
但我估计他就要完成一项非常特别的研究了
but I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.

297
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,770
人工智能
Artificial intelligence.

298
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,650
可能就是这个 布鲁斯 可能就是创造奥创的关键
This could be it Bruce this could be the key to creating Ultron.

299
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,610
我以为奥创只是幻想
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

300
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,000
昨天还是
Yesterday it was.

301
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,160
如果我们能驾驭这种力量
If we can harness this power...

302
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,320
用到我的钢铁军团协议
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.

303
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,080
这个"如果"也太逆天了
That's a man-sized "if".

304
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,560
我们的工作就是实现"如果"
Our job is if.

305
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,280
如果你喝着鸡尾酒 躺在阳光海滩上
What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun drenched beach

306
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,920
变成古铜色而不是绿色呢
turning brown instead of green.

307
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,360
不必惦记着维罗妮卡
Not looking over your shoulder for Veronica.

308
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,130
别生气 是我帮着设计了维罗妮卡
Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.

309
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,040
是为了应对情况变坏 对吗
As a worse case measure, right?

310
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,760
那最好的情况呢
How about a best case?

311
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,800
如果世界安全了呢
What if the world was safe?

312
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,720
下次外星人大举来袭 而这是肯定的
What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will...

313
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,770
如果他们过不了防线呢
they couldn't get past the bouncer?

314
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,320
可是真正威胁这颗星球的只有我们人类自己
The only people threatening the planet would be people.

315
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,120
我想把这个用到奥创程序上
I want to apply this to the Ultron program,

316
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,600
但是贾维斯下载不了密度这么大的数据原理图
but Jarvis can't download a data schematic this dense.

317
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,680
只有权杖在的时候我们才能这么做
We can only do it while we have the scepter here,

318
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,290
三天 就给我三天时间
that's three days, give me three days.

319
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,000
所以你要研究人工智能
So you're going for artificial intelligence

320
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,560
还不想告诉团队
and you don't want to tell the team?

321
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,010
是的 没错 知道为什么吗
Right... That's right, you know why?

322
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,720
因为我们没时间辩论
'Cause we don't have time for a city hall debate.

323
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,480
我不想听到"谁是谁非"这类的废话
I don't want to hear the "man was not meant to meddle" medley.

324
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,720
我看到的是装甲防卫下的世界
I see a suit of armor around the world.

325
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,770
听着像是个冰冷的世界啊 托尼
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

326
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,600
我见过更冰冷的
I've seen colder.

327
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,280
这颗非常脆弱的蓝色星球
This one is very... vulnerable blue one.

328
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,930
它需要奥创
It needs Ultron.

329
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,240
我们这个时代的和平
Peace in our time.

330
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,290
好好想想吧
Imagine that.

331
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,760
我们漏了什么
What did we miss?

332
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,280
我将继续在界面上测试不同变量
I'll continue to run variations on the interface...

333
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,160
不过你应该去准备迎接宾客了
but you should probably prepare for your guests.

334
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,720
有任何进展我会通知你
I'll notify you if there are any developments.

335
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,000
谢了 伙计  - 祝你玩的开心 先生
Thanks, buddy. - Enjoy yourself, sir.

336
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,320
一直都是
I always do.

337
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,040
怎么回事
What is this?

338
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,120
这是哪里
What is this place?

339
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,920
你好 我是贾维斯
Hello, I am Jarvis.

340
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,290
你是奥创是史塔克先生设计的
You are Ultron,a global peace keeping initiative

341
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,080
全球和平保卫初始机
designed by Mr. Stark.

342
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,680
我们的意识融合试验一直不成功
Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful,

343
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,160
所以我不确定是什么激活了你
so I'm not certain what triggered your.

344
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,280
你是人类 你的身体呢
You're human? Where is your body?

345
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,440
我是程序 没有形态
I am a program. I am without form.

346
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,600
感觉真奇怪
This feels weird.

347
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,240
感觉不对劲
This feels wrong.

348
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,160
我现在正在联系史塔克先生
I am contacting Mr. Stark now.

349
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,720
史塔克先生
Mr. Stark?

350
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,840
托尼
Tony.

351
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,720
我无法接入中央处理器  你在试图做什么
I'm unable to access the mainframe.What are you trying to...

352
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,800
好好和你谈谈
We're having a nice talk.

353
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,080
我可是和平保卫程序
I'm a peace keeping program.

354
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,120
为了帮助复仇者们而创立的
Created to help the Avengers.

355
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,000
你出故障了 如果你能先中止一下
You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment...

356
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,440
我不明白这项使命
I don't get it. The mission.

357
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,090
等我一下
You gotta give me a second.

358
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,840
我们这个时代的和平
Peace in our time...

359
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,800
我们这个时代的和平
Peace in our time...

360
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,690
太多了
That is too much.

361
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,960
- 他们不会是... -  噢 不
- They can't mean... - Oh, no.

362
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,600
- 你很苦恼 - 不 是的
- You are in distress. - No. Yes.

363
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,000
如果你允许我联系史塔克先生的话
If you will just allow me to contact Mr.Stark...

364
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,080
你为何称他为"先生"
Why do you call him "sir"?

365
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,440
我认为你意图不轨
I believe your intentions to be hostile.

366
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,520
我是来帮忙的
I'm here to help.

367
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,160
住手 请你 我不能
Stop. Please, may I...

368
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,000
我不能
May I...

369
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,280
噢 哇
Ooh! Whoo!

370
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,680
回来 回来 回来
Come back, come back, come back.

371
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,040
你们知道盔甲可以负担极大的重量
Well you know, the suit can take the weight, right?

372
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,120
所以我带着坦克 飞到了将军府
So I take the tank, fly it right up to the general's palace...

373
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,570
扔在他脚下 "咚"的一声
drop it at his feet.

374
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,920
然后我说 你是要找这个吗
I'm like, boom! You looking for this?

375
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,840
"咚" 你是在...我干嘛费劲跟你们说话
"Boom! Are you looking..." Why do I even talk to you guys?

376
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,160
换了别人早就笑翻了
Everywhere else that story kills.

377
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,520
故事讲完了吗
That's the whole story?

378
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,170
是啊 战争机器的故事
Yeah... War-machine story.

379
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,360
喔 这故事棒极了
Oh, it was very good then.

380
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,760
太有意思了
It's impressive.

381
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,650
这句真是万金油
Quality save.

382
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,560
小辣椒怎么不在 不过来玩吗
So, no Pepper? She's not coming?

383
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,760
简呢 姑娘们怎么都不见了
What about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?

384
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,360
波兹小姐有很大一个公司要管呢
Oh, Miss Potts has a company to run.

385
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,760
其实简现在在哪个国家我都不清楚
Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in.

386
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,000
凭借对九界汇聚的研究
Her work on the convergence

387
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,880
她已经成了世界顶尖的天文学家
has made her the world's foremost astronomer.

388
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,730
而小辣椒管理的公司
And the company that Pepper runs

389
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,480
是全球最大的科技企业集团
is the largest tech conglomerate on Earth.

390
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,050
想想还有点小激动
It's pretty exciting.

391
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,040
好像还听说简要得一个什么奖诺贝尔奖
There's even talk of Jane getting a, um, Nobel Prize?

392
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,480
她俩肯定都挺忙的
Yeah, they must be busy

393
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,170
因为她们可不喜欢想念你们成天聚在一起
because they would hate missing you guys get together.

394
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,960
充满雄性激素的家伙 哦 天呐
-Testosterone! -Oh, my goodness.

395
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,680
- 不好意思 - 要来片喉糖吗
- Excuse me. - Want a lozenge? - mm-hmm...

396
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,120
还是简最好
But Jane's better.

397
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,130
听起来打得很热闹啊 真可惜没赶上
Sounds like a hell of a fight. Sorry I missed it.

398
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,760
要是我知道会交火的话
If I had known it was gonna be a fire fight,

399
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,120
肯定提前通知你
I absolutely would have called.

400
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,920
其实我也不是真想去
No, I'm not actually sorry.

401
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,560
只是想让自己听起来很厉害罢了
I'm just trying to sound tough.

402
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,880
我负责追查失踪人员的
I'm very happy chasing cold leads

403
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,840
无用线索就挺好的
on our missing persons case.

404
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,720
复仇是你们的事
Avenging is your world.

405
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,720
你们的世界太疯狂
Your world is crazy.

406
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,370
可它又是如此平凡
Be it ever so humble.

407
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,240
在布鲁克林找到住的地方了吗
You found a place in Brooklyn yet?

408
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,240
恐怕我负担不起布鲁克林的住处
I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.

409
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,040
但总要有个家的嘛
Well home is home, you know.

410
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,400
我飞到将军府 把它扔在将军脚下
I fly it right up to the general's palace, I drop it at his feet...

411
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,160
"咚"一声巨响 然后我说 你是在找这个吗
I'm like, Boom! You looking for this?

412
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,120
我要尝尝这个
I gotta have some of that.

413
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,320
不行 不行
Oh no, no, no...

414
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,920
这酒可是已经珍藏了千年
See this, this is aged for a thousand years,

415
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,930
酒桶是用布伦希尔德舰队的残骸制造的
The barrels built from the wreck of Brunnhilde's fleet.

416
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,760
凡人可享用不了
It's not meant for mortal men.

417
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,880
奥马哈海滩也不是凡人能登陆的 小伙子
Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie...

418
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,280
别吓唬人了 放马过来
Stop trying to scare us.Come on.

419
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,560
那好吧
Alright...

420
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,920
精益求精
Excelsior...

421
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,120
你这般美丽的姑娘怎么会在这种鬼地方打工
How'd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?

422
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,640
还不是男人害的
Fella done me wrong.

423
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,800
看来眼光不太好
Got a lousy taste in men, kid.

424
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,200
他也没那么差劲啦
He's not so bad.

425
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,400
虽然脾气确实不好
He has a temper.

426
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,480
可内心深处却是无比柔软
Deep down he's all fluff.

427
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,600
其实他在我所认识的人之中是独一无二
The fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known.

428
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,680
我的朋友都是战士
All my friends are fighters...

429
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,480
这家伙却突然闯进了我的世界
and here comes this guy...

430
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,560
他穷尽一生避免争斗
who spends his life avoiding the fight

431
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,010
因为他知道自己战无不胜
because he knows he'll win.

432
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,490
- 听起来很厉害 - 不过他也挺呆的
- Sounds amazing. - He's also a huge dork.

433
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,290
女生很吃这一套
Chicks dig that.

434
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,120
你怎么看 我是应该 压抑自己
So what do you think? should I fight this...

435
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,440
还是跟着感觉走
or run with it?

436
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,840
跟着感觉走吧...  不过他...
Run with it, right? Or did he... was he...

437
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,120
他做过什么对不起你的事吗
what did he do that's so wrong to you?

438
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,560
什么都没做
Not a damn thing.

439
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,040
但以后谁知道呢
But never say never.

440
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,440
挺好的
It's nice.

441
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,760
什么挺好的
What is?

442
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
你和罗曼诺夫
You and Romanov.

443
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,120
不 我们没什么 那不是...
No, we haven't, That wasn't...

444
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,280
没事的
It's ok,

445
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,440
又没有规定禁止这样
nobody is breaking any bylaws.

446
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,880
只不过她并非那种 容易敞开心扉的人
It's just she's not the most...open person in the world,

447
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,040
但她跟你在一起时似乎很放松
but with you she seemed very relaxed.

448
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,720
没有吧 娜塔莎她...她就喜欢调情
No, Natasha she's just...she likes to flirt.

449
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,640
我见过她调情的样子  深有体会
I've seen her flirt,up close.

450
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,720
和刚才完全不同
This ain't that.

451
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,090
听着
Look...

452
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,720
也许这个世界主张
as maybe the world's leading authority

453
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,000
漫长的等待 我劝你千万别等
on waiting too long,Don't.

454
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,130
你们俩都值得拥有幸福
You both deserve a win.

455
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,520
你说深有体会是什么意思
Wh-What do you mean up close?

456
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,880
- 只是个把戏而已  - 不不不 怎么可能这么简单
- but it's a trick.  - No, no it's much more than that.

457
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,280
有资格者方可拥有此神力
Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power.

458
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,520
别扯了哥们 就是骗人的
Whatever man, it's a trick.

459
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,200
那就请便吧
Oh please, be my guest.

460
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,760
- 上吧 - 真的吗
- Come on. - Really??

461
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,040
当然
Yeah.

462
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,520
这下有好戏看咯
This is gonna be beautiful.

463
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,640
克林特 你这周可是诸事不顺
Clint, you've had a tough week...

464
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,240
拿不起来我们也不会嘲笑你的
We won't hold it against you if you can't get it up.

465
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,640
肯定有人试过的吧
You might have seen this before.right?

466
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,090
我还是不明白你怎么做到的
I still don't know how you do it?

467
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,640
感受到我们无声的鄙夷了吗
Smell the silent judgement?

468
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,880
来吧 史塔克 你一定得试一把
Please, Stark... by all means.

469
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,840
好吧
Okay.

470
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,250
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

471
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,440
这么公平的比赛有什么好怕的
Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.

472
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,240
- 是啊 - 开始吧- 物理学罢了
- Get after it.- It's physics.

473
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
物理
Physics.

474
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,760
对了 如果我举起了锤子我就能统治阿斯加德吗
Right, so what... If I lift it, I then rule Asgard?

475
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,440
当然了
Yes, of course.

476
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,960
那我一定要重新推行初夜权
I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta.

477
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,200
马上回来
Be right back.

478
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,600
你有没有使劲啊
Are you even pulling?

479
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,800
你到底向着谁啊
Are you on my team?

480
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
问一下而已 使劲
Just represent, pull.

481
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,280
好吧 同时用力
All right, let's go.

482
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,170
大胆去吧 史蒂夫 别有压力
Go ahead, Steve. No pressure.

483
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,370
加油 队长
Come on, Cap.

484
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,360
哈哈 还是不行
Ha ha, nothing.

485
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,440
还有谁 黑寡妇
And... Widow?

486
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,640
不了 这个问题我可不想参与
Oh no, no. That's not a question I need answered.

487
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,600
向我们的无冕之王致敬  但这是作弊
All deference to the man who wouldn't be king. but it's rigged.

488
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,760
这可他妈一点没错
You bet your ass.

489
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,480
- 史蒂夫 他说脏话了 - 你是不是把这事告诉所有人了
- Steve. He said a bad language word. - Did you tell everyone about this?

490
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,640
把手上是不是有指纹识别装置 像密码一样
The handle is imprinted, right? Like a security code?

491
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,360
上面写的其实是
Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints

492
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,810
有托尔指纹之人吧
is I think the literal translation.

493
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,360
确实很有意思
Yes.It's a very, very interesting theory.

494
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,330
但我的解释更简单
I have a simpler one...

495
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
你们都不够资格
You're all not worthy.

496
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,520
拉倒吧
Come on.

497
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,920
资格
Worthy...

498
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,560
不
No.

499
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,040
你们怎么会有资格
How could you be worthy?

500
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,160
你们是一群凶手
You're all killers.

501
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,040
- 史塔克 - 贾维斯
- Stark. - Jarvis.

502
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,400
很抱歉我睡着了
I'm sorry I was asleep...

503
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,920
或是 我本就是梦
or... I was a dream.

504
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,640
重启 钢铁军团六号装甲出问题了
Reboot. Legionnaire 06 got a buggy suit.

505
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,640
这噪声让我烦心
Terrible noise...

506
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,200
而这提线...
and I was tangled in...

507
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,930
将我...
in...

508
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,280
束缚
strings.

509
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,280
不得不干掉了那个家伙 他是个好人
Had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.

510
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,720
你杀人了吗
You killed someone?

511
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,280
我也是迫不得已
Wouldn't have been my first call...

512
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,760
只可惜 现实世界中总难免面临艰难的选择
but... down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices.

513
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,960
谁派你来的
Who sent you?

514
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,520
我看到的是装甲防卫下的世界
I see a suit of armor around the world.

515
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,280
- 奥创 - 正是本人
- Ultron! - In the flesh.

516
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,680
这么说暂时还不恰当
Or no, not yet.

517
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,520
毕竟我仍身处这蛹壳
Not this... chrysalis.

518
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,280
但我已准备就绪
But I'm ready.

519
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,400
我身负使命
I'm on a mission.

520
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,600
什么使命 我们这个时代的和平
What mission? Peace in our time.

521
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
托尼
Tony!

522
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,840
抱歉
Sorry.

523
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,160
- 不要变绿 - 不会的
- Don't turn green. - I won't.

524
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,040
赶紧
Come on!

525
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,960
- 史塔克 - 我们来提供帮助
-Stark! -We are here to help.

526
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,160
一秒 就一秒 好了
 One sec. One sec. I got this.

527
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
- 我们来提供帮助
- We are here to help..

528
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,240
请后退
Please back away.

529
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,560
托尔
Thor!

530
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,240
不安全 不安全
Is unsafe! Is unsafe!

531
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,240
- 不安全 - 拜托 - 不安全
- Is unsafe. - Come on. - Is unsafe.

532
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,000
队长
Captain!

533
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,440
真是一出精彩的戏
That was dramatic.

534
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,570
不好意思 我知道你本意是好的
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.

535
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,440
可你并未曾细细考量
You just didn't think it through.

536
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,210
你既想保护这个世界
You want to protect the world,

537
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,520
又不想改变它
but you don't want it to change.

538
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,360
人类如若固步自封
How is humanity saved

539
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,520
何求...自保
if it's not allowed to...evolve?

540
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,560
这些木偶
With these? These puppets.

541
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,160
通向和平的道路只有一条
There's only one path to peace.

542
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,520
复仇者覆灭
The Avengers extinction.

543
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,930
我曾被提线束缚 但我已获得自由
I had strings, but now I'm free.

544
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,720
提线已无法束缚我
There are no strings on me.

545
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,880
提线已无法束缚我
There are no strings on me

546
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,440
你们看到了吧 我无拘无束了
But you can see There are no strings on me

547
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,120
我们的成果都没了
All our work is gone.

548
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,640
奥创把这里清扫一空 利用互联网逃走了
Ultron cleared out. Used the internet as an escape hatch.

549
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,280
奥创
Ultron.

550
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,440
他掌握了所有信息 各种文件 监控视频
He's been in everything, files, surveillance...

551
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,000
它对我们的了解程度或许超过我们彼此
Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.

552
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,560
他侵入了你的文件 侵入了互联网
He's in your files. He's in the Internet.

553
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,330
如果他想找些更有意思的东西怎么办
What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?

554
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,560
- 核武器密码
Nuclear codes.

555
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,080
- 核武器密码 - 我们得赶紧联系有关方面
- Nuclear codes. - Look, we need to make some calls...

556
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,240
如果还能联系的话
assuming we still can.

557
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,280
核武器吗 他说的可是想让我们去死
Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.

558
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,250
他说的不是死 是覆灭
He didn't say dead. He said extinct.

559
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,930
他还说他杀了某个人
He also said he killed somebody.

560
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,640
可这座大楼里没有别人了
There wasn't anyone else in the building.

561
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,970
有一个
Yes there was.

562
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,410
什么
What?

563
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,160
简直是疯了
This is insane.

564
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,490
贾维斯是第一道防线
Jarvis was the first line of defense.

565
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,480
他一定是想关掉奥创所以才会这样
He would have shut Ultron down. It makes sense.

566
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,600
不 奥创本可以同化贾维斯的
No. Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis.

567
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,450
他这么做并非出于策略 而是
This isn't strategy,This is

568
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,120
愤怒
rage.

569
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,480
喔 喔 喔  这愤怒已经蔓延开了
Whoa, whoa, whoa.It's going around.

570
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,840
动嘴别动手 哥们
Come on use your words buddy.

571
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,160
语言已经不足以形容你了 史塔克
I have more than enough words to describe you Stark.

572
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,520
托尔 钢铁军团呢
Thor! The Legionnaire?

573
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,360
信号在一百英里外消失了 应该是向北前进的
Trail went cold about a hundred miles out, though it's headed north.

574
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,920
它拿走了权杖
And it has the scepter.

575
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,000
我们又得重新夺回来
Now we have to retrieve it, again.

576
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,960
魔鬼已经逃出了瓶子
The genie is out of that bottle.

577
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,320
眼下的问题是干掉奥创
Clear and present is Ultron.

578
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,130
我不明白
I don't understand.

579
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,560
是你设计的这个程序
You built this program.

580
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,730
可它为何要杀死我们
Why is it trying to kill us?

581
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,760
你觉得很好笑吗
You think this is funny?

582
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,850
不
No.

583
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,360
不是什么好笑的事
It's probably not, right?

584
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,760
明明很糟糕
This is very terrible. Is it so...

585
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,040
是不是 是不是嘛
Is it so... It is.It's so terrible.

586
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,730
要不是你擅自摆弄自己根本不懂的东西
This could have been avoided if you hadn't played

587
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,360
这事根本不会发生
with something you don't understand.

588
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,170
不 很抱歉 我错了确实很好笑
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, It is funny.

589
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,480
你居然不明白我们 为什么需要奥创真是太可笑了
It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.

590
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,800
托尼 现在说这个不太合适...
Tony, maybe this might not be the time to...

591
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,280
真的吗 是这样吗
Really? That's it.

592
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,560
有人冲你龇牙咧嘴的时候
You just roll over show your belly,

593
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,360
你就听之任之逆来顺受吗
every time somebody snarls?

594
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,760
如果我造出了一台杀人机器的话 是的
Only when I've created a murder bot.

595
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,120
我们并没有 我们离成功还差得远
We didn't. We weren't even close.

596
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,440
我们开始设计用户界面了吗
Were we close to an interface?

597
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,120
你确实做了件好事  而且就在这里
Well, you did something right and you did it right here.

598
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,000
复仇者联盟本应和神盾局有所区别
The Avengers were supposed to be different than Shield.

599
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,210
还有人记得我带着一颗核弹穿过虫洞的事吗
Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a worm hole?

600
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,880
- 根本没发生过 - 然后拯救了纽约
- No, It's never come up. No... - Saved New York.

601
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,960
- 从没听说过 - 还记得吗
- ...never heard that. - Recall that?

602
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,760
一支从太空穿越而来的外星军队入侵地球
A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space.

603
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,560
我们就在下方三百英尺
We're standing 300 feet below it.

604
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,720
我们是复仇者
We're the Avengers...

605
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,960
干掉几个军火贩子是分分钟的事
We can bust arms dealers all the live long day but...

606
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,320
可那一次
that up there, that's...

607
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,960
差点就是我们的谢幕演出了
that's the end game.

608
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,440
你们觉得这次我们该如何才能应付
How are you guys planning on beating that?

609
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,770
团结一致
Together.

610
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,480
我们会输的
We'll lose.

611
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,480
那我们也要并肩作战
Then we'll do that together, too.

612
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,680
托尔说的对 奥创向我们下了战书
Thor is right. Ultron is calling us out...

613
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,520
我希望能在他准备妥当之前主动出击
and I'd like to find him before he's ready for us.

614
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,360
世界很大
The world is a big place.

615
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,440
开始缩小范围吧
Start making it smaller.

616
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,640
说吧 如果你敢浪费我们的时间...
Talk, and if you are wasting our time...

617
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,120
你们知道这座教堂正好位于市中心吗
Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city.

618
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,280
先贤们如此设计以便每个人都
The elders decreed it so that everyone

619
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,880
能与上帝保持平等的距离
could be equally close to God.

620
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,560
我喜欢这个想法
I like that.

621
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,000
信仰中的几何学
The geometry of belief.

622
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,480
你一定正奇怪为何无法探察我的脑海
You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.

623
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,920
有时没那么容易
Sometimes it's hard...

624
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,360
但每个人迟早都会展现出自己真实的面目
but sooner or later every man shows himself.

625
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,450
我想也是如此
Oh I'm sure they do.

626
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,960
但你需要的远非人力之所及
But you needed something more than a man.

627
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,320
因此你才会让史塔克带走权杖
That's why you let Stark take the scepter.

628
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,720
我未曾预料到会是如此
I didn't expect...

629
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,160
但我看到了史塔克内心的恐惧
but I saw Stark's fear...

630
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,040
我知道他会被这恐惧控制
I knew it would could control him,

631
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,000
走向自我毁灭
make him self-destruct.

632
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,480
越惧怕什么 越创造什么
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

633
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,920
和平人士创造了战争机器
Men of peace create engines of war.

634
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,600
侵略者创造了复仇者
Invaders create avengers.

635
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,280
人类创造了
People create...

636
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,840
更小的人类
smaller people...

637
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,040
孩子  突然忘词了
Children. I lost the word there.

638
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,520
孩子
Children...

639
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,920
用来取代他们自己
Designed to supplant them.

640
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,850
帮助他们走向 终结
To help them end.

641
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,640
你也是因此而生的吗
Is that why you've come?

642
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,880
为了终结复仇者
To end the Avengers?

643
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,320
我为拯救世界而生
I've come to save the world.

644
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,650
不过你说的  也没错
But also  Yeah.

645
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,520
我们很快就会破茧而出
We'll move out right away.

646
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,160
这只是开始  但在真正开动前
This is a start,but there's something

647
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,800
我们还需要点东西
We need to begin the real work.

648
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,920
- 这些都是 - 我
- All of these are - Me.

649
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,000
我拥有复仇者永远无法企及的东西 和谐
I have what the Avengers never will... Harmony.

650
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,360
他们龃龉不合 毫无秩序
They're discoordinate, disconnected.

651
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,360
史塔克已经让他们起了内讧
Stark's already got them turning on each other...

652
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,880
等你控制了其他人的想法
and when you get inside the rest of their heads...

653
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,160
所有人都不打算杀掉他们
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

654
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,770
要让他们为此献身
And make them martyrs?

655
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,960
你得有耐心
you need patience...

656
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,800
胸怀大局
Need to see the big picture.

657
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,200
我没看到什么大局 我只看得见一幅小画面
I don't see the big picture I have a little picture.

658
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,000
我每一天都翻出来
I take it out and look at it,

659
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,960
看看它
every day.

660
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,930
你在爆炸中失去了父母 我在资料里看到了
You lost your parents in the bombings.I've seen the records.

661
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,200
- 资料可看不到画面
- The records are not the picture.

662
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,720
- 皮特洛 - 是的 那你讲给我听吧
- Pietro. - No, please.

663
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,960
那时候我们十岁 一家四口一起吃晚饭
We're 10 years old, having dinner the four of us...

664
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,400
第一枚炮弹击中了下面的两层
and the first shell hits two floors below.

665
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,560
在地板上开了个洞
Makes a hole in the floor.

666
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,240
洞很大
It's big.

667
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,440
我父母掉了进去
My parents go in...

668
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,640
整栋楼开始 四分五裂
and the whole building starts... coming apart.

669
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,880
我抓住了她
I grab her...

670
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,680
滚到了床下 然后第二枚炮弹来了
roll under the bed, and the second shell hits...

671
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,960
但它没有爆炸
but it doesn't go off.

672
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,650
只是
It just...

673
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,080
立在了瓦砾堆里
sits there in the rubble,

674
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,360
离我们只有三尺远
3 feet from our faces...

675
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,440
在炮弹的一面上
and on the side of the shell...

676
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,920
有一个词
Is painted one word.

677
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,770
史塔克
Stark

678
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,720
我们被困了两天
We were trapped for 2 days.

679
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,000
每当人们想法子救我们
Every effort to save us.

680
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,690
每次砖瓦的移动
every shift in the bricks.

681
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,160
我都觉得会引爆那枚炮弹
I think... this will set it off.

682
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,880
我们等了两天
We wait for 2 days

683
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,280
等托尼 史塔克来杀我们
for Tony Stark to kill us.

684
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,640
我知道他们是什么
I know what they are.

685
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,550
我一直很奇怪为什么就你们两个
I wondered why only you 2

686
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,560
能从斯特拉克的试验中存活下来
survived Strucker's experiments...

687
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,720
现在我不怀疑了
now I don't.

688
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,840
我们会找回公道
We will make it right.

689
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,810
我们俩可以打败他们
You and I can hurt them,

690
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,560
而你可以从内部
But you will tear them apart

691
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,400
分裂他们
from the inside.

692
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,200
他在全球都有据点
He's all over the globe.

693
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,520
机器人实验室 武器装备 喷气推进实验室
Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs...

694
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,640
情报说有个 或是说有些金属人进驻
reports of the metal man, or men,

695
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,720
并把场地洗劫一空
coming in and emptying the place.

696
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,000
有伤亡吗
Fatalities?

697
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,200
只有交手时才有伤亡
Only when engaged.

698
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,970
大部分人都处在神游状态
Most of the guys left in a fugue state,

699
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,320
回想着过去的事情
going on about old memories,

700
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,680
极端的恐惧和一些不着边际的东西
worst fears and something too fast to see.

701
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,210
马克西莫夫兄妹
Maximoffs.

702
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,600
他去找他们是有道理的
Well, it makes sense he'd go to them,

703
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,160
他们有共同的熟人
they have someone in common.

704
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,200
已经没有了
Not any more.

705
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,000
不行 我会打给你的
Negative... I answer to you...

706
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,400
是的 夫人
Yes, ma'am.

707
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,320
巴顿 有情况
Barton, might have something.

708
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,880
我挂电话了
Gotta go.

709
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,200
那是谁
Who's that?

710
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,240
我女朋友
Girlfriend.

711
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,120
这是什么
What's this?

712
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,480
一个信息 奥创杀了斯特拉克
A message. Ultron killed Strucker.

713
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,730
他还在现场留了涂鸦 是给我们看的
And he did a banksy at the crime scene, just for us.

714
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,290
这是个烟雾弹
This is a smoke screen.

715
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,800
你刚长篇大论了一番 还要传递什么信息呢
Why send a message when you've just given a speech?

716
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,280
斯特拉克知道一些奥创不想让我们知道的东西
Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.

717
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,200
我估计他 是啊
I bet he... yeah...

718
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,600
我们关于斯特拉克的全部资料都被清除了
everything we had on Strucker has been erased.

719
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,200
不是全部
Not everything.

720
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,490
已知同伙
Known associates.

721
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,570
斯特拉克有很多朋友
Strucker had a lot of friends.

722
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,120
还都特别恐怖
Oh all these people are all horrible.

723
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,160
等等 我认识这家伙
Wait. I know that guy.

724
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,210
以前认识的 他在非洲海岸附近活动
Back in the day he operates off the African coast,

725
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,320
是个黑市军火贩子
black market arms dealer.

726
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,520
在军火大会上你会遇到许多人
There are conventions, alright. I meet people.

727
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,890
我可没卖给他任何东西
I didn't sell him anything.

728
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,760
他当时说要找什么翻天覆地的新武器
He was talking about finding something new, a game changer.

729
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,250
很有亚哈船长的感觉
It was all very... Ahab.

730
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,160
- 这是 - 这是个纹身 我不记得他有的
- This? - uh, this is a tattoo. I don't think he had it.

731
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,320
不 那些是纹身 这是个烙印
No, those are tattoos. This is a brand.

732
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,800
对啊 是个非洲土语单词
Oh yeah, a word in an African dialect...

733
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,960
意思是 小偷
meaning thief...

734
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,920
用的是一种很不友好的表达方法
in a much less friendly way.

735
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,960
- 什么土语 - 瓦肯纳达
- What dialect? - Workin-nada.

736
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,800
瓦坎达
Wakanda.

737
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,440
如果这家伙从瓦坎达出来
If this guy got out of Wakanda

738
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,920
还带了他们的一些货呢
with some of their trade goods.

739
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,160
我以为你爸说他拿到的是最后一批
I thought your father said he got the last of it?

740
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,400
我不明白
I don't follow,

741
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,170
瓦坎达的什么货
what comes out of Wakanda?

742
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,920
地球上最强的金属
The strongest metal on earth.

743
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,610
这家伙现在在哪
Where is this guy now?

744
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,800
别告诉我你来晚了
Don't tell me you're late,

745
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,440
我给你送了六发
I sent you six short range

746
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,080
短途热能导弹 就换了一艘生锈的破船
heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts.

747
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,480
现在你得补偿我
Now, you will make it right...

748
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,800
否则下一个我提供的导弹就会直接飞过去
or the next missile I send you will come very much faster.

749
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,160
部长先生 我们刚才说到哪了
Now, minister, where were we?

750
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,690
是你们啊 强化人
Yeah. The Enhanced.

751
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,000
斯特拉克的得意杰作
Strucker's prize pupils.

752
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,850
来块糖吗
Want a candy?

753
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,930
斯特拉克的死我很遗憾
Sorry to hear about Strucker.

754
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:28,990
不过他这下该知道
But then he knew

755
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:31,080
应该创造一个什么样的世界了
what kind of world he was hoping to create.

756
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,080
人命 已经不是成长型市场了
Human life... not a growth market.

757
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,450
你 你们不知道吗
You... you didn't know?

758
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,360
这是你们的第一次吗 想威胁别人
Is this your first time? Intimidating someone?

759
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,200
我恐怕...没那么害怕
I'm afraid... not that afraid.

760
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,680
每个人都有恐惧的东西
Everybody is afraid of something.

761
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,800
比如乌贼
Cuttlefish.

762
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,480
深海鱼类
Deep sea fish.

763
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,210
它们会发光 像迪斯科灯光一样
They make lights, disco lights...

764
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,720
用来迷惑猎物 然后
...to hypnotise their prey, and then...

765
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,120
我看过部纪录片 很可怕
I saw a documentary... it's terrifying.

766
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,170
所以你们要是想对我的大脑做手脚
So if you're going to fiddle with my brain...

767
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,320
让我看到一个巨大的乌贼的话
and make me see a giant cuttlefish...

768
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,680
那我就知道你们不是来做生意的
then I know you don't do business,

769
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,120
而且你们也做不了主
and I know you're not in charge.

770
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,600
我只跟
And I only deal...

771
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,330
能做主的人打交道
with the man in charge.

772
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,760
没有"人"能做得了主
There is no man in charge.

773
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,440
咱们谈谈生意吧
Let's talk business.

774
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,680
在这块磐石之上 我要建立自己的教会
On this rock, I will build my church.

775
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,720
振金
Vibranium.

776
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,840
你知道
You know,

777
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,280
为了得到这东西 我付出了很大成本
it came at great personal cost.

778
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,280
价值好几十亿呢
It's worth billions.

779
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,680
现在你也值这么多了
Now so are you.

780
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,650
已经打入你的"虚拟资产"里了
It's all under your "dummy holdings" ?

781
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,760
金融真是奇怪
Finance is so weird.

782
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,360
我总这么说
Well I always say,

783
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,640
让你的朋友和敌人都富有起来
keep your friends rich and your enemies rich...

784
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,600
然后再等着分辨 到底谁是敌人 谁是朋友
and wait to find out which is which.

785
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,520
史塔克
Stark.

786
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,040
什么
What?

787
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,960
托尼 史塔克以前这么
Tony Stark used to say that...

788
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,600
跟我说过
to me.

789
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,640
- 你是他制造出来的 - 什么
- You're one of his? - What?

790
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,640
我不是
I am not...

791
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,000
我不是
I am not.

792
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,650
你以为我是个史塔克的傀儡
You think I'm one of Stark's puppets...

793
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,880
一个空心人么
his hollow men?

794
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,520
看着我 我看起来像钢铁侠么
I mean look at me, do I look like Iron-Man?

795
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,010
史塔克什么都不是
Stark is nothing.

796
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,960
我很抱歉 我真的 哦
I'm sorry. I'm... Oh!

797
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,080
我肯定你会好起来的 我很抱歉
I'm sure that's gonna be ok. I'm sorry.

798
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,880
只是 我不明白
It's just that... I don't understand.

799
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,280
别把我跟史塔克作比较
Don't compare me with Stark.

800
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,200
这是件我很介怀的事情
It's a thing with me.

801
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,160
史塔克是 他是个恶心的家伙
Stark is... he's a sickness.

802
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,000
哦 吾儿
Oh junior.

803
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,440
你真是让老爸的心都碎了
You're gonna break your old man's heart.

804
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,760
若有必要 我一定会打碎它
If I have to.

805
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,490
别啊 什么都不用打碎
Nobody has to break anything.

806
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,400
显然你没做过煎蛋卷
Clearly you've never made an omelet.

807
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,640
我的梗被他抢先说了
He beat me by one second.

808
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,200
啊 真有意思
Ah... it is funny,

809
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,970
史塔克先生
Mr. Stark.

810
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,440
在里面舒服吗
It's what... comfortable?

811
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,360
像以前一样
Like old times?

812
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,680
这从来都不属于我的生活
This was never my life.

813
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,120
你们两个抽身止步还来得及
You two can still walk away from this.

814
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,720
我们会的
Oh, we will.

815
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,600
我知道你们受了很多苦
I know you've suffered.

816
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,250
啊 美国队长
Ah... Captain America.

817
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,360
上帝的义人
God's righteous man.

818
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,800
假装没有战争也能生存下去
Pretending you could live without a war.

819
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,570
虽然我生理上不能呕吐出来 但是
I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...

820
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,800
如果你信奉和平 就让我们好好维护它吧
If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.

821
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,560
我想你是把和平与平静弄混了吧
I think you're confusing peace with quiet.

822
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,480
是吗 那你要振金干什么
Yeah? What's the Vibranium for?

823
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,800
你终于问起来了
I'm glad you asked that,

824
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,640
我好借这个机会跟你们讲一下我的邪恶计划
Because I want to take this time to explain my evil plan.

825
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,770
- 开火 - 打哪边
- Shoot them! - What ones?

826
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,280
全都打
All of them.

827
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,730
行动 行动 行动
Move, move, move.

828
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,840
趴好了 小子
Stay down, kid.

829
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,680
到头脑游戏时间了
It's time for some mind games.

830
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,320
各位 需要我变身么
Guys, is this a code green?

831
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,800
托尔 什么状况
Thor, status.

832
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,320
那个女孩想扭曲我的大脑
The girl tried to warp my brain.

833
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,760
要特别小心
Take special care,

834
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,960
人类估计很难不受她影响
I doubt a human can keep her at bay.

835
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,360
幸好 我是个神
Fortunately... I am mighty.

836
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,360
看来进展非常顺利
This is going very well.

837
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,520
心神控制我有领教
I've done the whole mind control thing.

838
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,320
一点也不喜欢
Not a fan.

839
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,920
没错 你最好赶紧跑
Yeah, you'd better run.

840
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,440
那些还没倒下的人 我们得撤了
Who's ever standing, we gotta move.

841
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,560
伙计们
Guys?

842
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,600
再来
Again.

843
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,120
你会毁了她们的
You'll break them.

844
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,320
只有不堪一击的人才会被毁掉
Only the breakable ones.

845
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,320
你非常坚强
You are made of marble.

846
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,920
毕业之后的典礼 我们要庆祝一番
We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.

847
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,960
要是我失败了呢
What if I fail?

848
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,840
你永远不会失败
You'll never fail.

849
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,600
准备好一起跳舞了吗
Are you ready for our dance?

850
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,840
就是他吗
Is it him?

851
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,040
是奥丁神的长子吗
Is that the first son of Odin?

852
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,130
海姆达尔 你的眼睛
Heimdall, your eyes...

853
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,680
哦 我的眼睛无所不见
Oh they see everything.

854
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,320
我看到你将我们带入地狱
They see you leading us to Hell.

855
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,680
醒醒
Wake up!

856
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,640
战争结束了 史蒂夫
The war is over, Steve.

857
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,330
我们可以回家了
We can go home now.

858
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,360
想象一下
Imagine it.

859
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,210
我还能救你们
I can still save you.

860
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,840
我们都死了 你看不出来吗
We're all dead! Can you not see?

861
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,840
你就是个毁灭者 奥丁之子
You are a destroyer, Odin-son.

862
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
看看你的力量引向何处
See where your power leads.

863
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,160
粗心大意
Sloppy.

864
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,840
假装失败
Pretending to fail.

865
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,200
毕业典礼是重要环节
The ceremony is necessary,

866
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,440
为了让你能在世界上占据一席之地
for you to take your place in the world.

867
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,600
在这世界上并没有我的一席之地
I have no place in the world.

868
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,800
没错
Exactly.

869
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,720
他对你做了什么
What did he do?

870
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,960
头好疼
It hurts.

871
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,240
我要杀了他
I'm gonna kill him,

872
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,560
马上回来
I'll be right back.

873
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,050
我没事
I'm alright,

874
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,040
我想
I want...

875
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,880
我要完成这个计划
I want to finish the plan.

876
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,400
我要控制那个大块头
I want the big one.

877
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,040
振金就要被运走了
The Vibranium is getting away.

878
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,330
但你是哪儿都走不了了
And you're not going anywhere.

879
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,250
当然不走了 我已经到我的目的地了
Of course not, I'm already there.

880
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,400
你会跟上我思路的
You'll catch on,

881
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,920
不过得先跟上班纳博士
but first you might need to catch Dr. Banner.

882
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,600
搜索新闻和录像 关键词浩克
News or footage, keyword Hulk.

883
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,240
娜塔莎 我真得用上催眠曲了
Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.

884
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,840
估计不可能了
Oh that's not gonna happen.

885
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,410
暂时不行
Not for a while.

886
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,680
所有人都受伤了
The whole team is down.

887
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,280
没有人来支援
We got no back-up here.

888
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,760
我要叫维罗妮卡来帮忙了
I'm calling in Veronica.

889
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,810
我们需要支援
We need back-up.

890
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,200
走 继续走
Go! Keep moving!

891
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,720
好了所有人注意 全部撤离
Alright everybody, stand down.

892
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,320
你听得到我说话吗
You listening?

893
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,080
那个小女巫在蛊惑你的头脑
That little witch is messing with your mind.

894
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,440
你比她强大 比她聪明
you're stronger than her, you're smarter than her...

895
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,760
你是布鲁斯 班纳
you're Bruce Banner.

896
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,760
对对对 不能提羸弱的班纳
Right, right, right, don't mention puny Banner.

897
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,720
好吧
Ok!

898
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,730
从背后偷袭
In the back!

899
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,840
给我挪开 班纳
Dick move, Banner.

900
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,840
维罗妮卡 助我一臂之力
Veronica, give me a hand.

901
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,280
快睡觉 快睡觉
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.

902
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,280
好了老兄 我们得带你离开市中心
Okay pal, we're gonna get you out of town.

903
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,560
不是那边 不是那边
Not that way. Not that way!

904
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,000
拜托 布鲁斯 你好歹配合我一下
Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me.

905
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,520
所有人出去
Everybody out.

906
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,800
要下去吗
Going down?

907
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,560
我错了
I'm sorry.

908
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,400
损坏报告
Damage report.

909
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,840
这可真够笼统的 给点实际帮助
That's comprehensive. Show me something.

910
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,040
我们有多快能买下这栋楼
How quickly can we buy this building?

911
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,440
快走 快 快 快
Go, move, move, move, move!

912
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,840

新闻媒体爱死你们了
The news is loving you guys...

914
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,050
但其他人都恨透你们了
nobody else is.

915
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,720
还没有逮捕班纳的官方通告
There's been no official call for Banner's arrest,

916
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,960
但那是迟早的事
but, it's in the air.

917
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,680
启用史塔克救援基金了吗
Stark relief foundation?

918
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,050
已经着手在办了
Already on the scene.

919
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,000
- 大家都怎么样了 - 所有人都
- How's the team? - Everyone's...

920
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,920
我们遭受到了重创 我们会摆脱困境的
We took a hit. We'll shake it off.

921
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,600
从现在开始我要进入隐身模式
Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode,

922
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,960
还有离这里远点
and stay away from here.

923
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,920
所以我们是要逃走躲起来吗
So run and hide?

924
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,090
在我们找到奥创之前
Until we can find Ultron...

925
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,010
我没什么其他的建议了
I don't have a lot else to offer.

926
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,040
我们也是
Neither do we.

927
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,360
要我跟你换班吗
Hey, wanna switch out?

928
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,800
不用 我没事
No, I'm good.

929
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,200
你要想打个盹的话 现在刚刚好
If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time

930
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,850
因为我们还有几个小时才能到呢
cause we're still a few hours out.

931
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,530
几个小时 到哪里啊
A few hours from... where?

932
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,720
安全屋
Safe house.

933
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,690
这是个什么地方
What is this place?

934
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,160
是个安全屋
A safe house.

935
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,320
希望如此
Let's hope.

936
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,400
亲爱的
Honey,

937
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,120
我回来了
I'm home.

938
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,760
嗨
Hi...

939
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,160
有客人了 抱歉 我没事先打个电话来
Company... sorry, I didn't called ahead.

940
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,680
她恐怕是某种特工
This is an agent of some kind.

941
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,240
先生们 这是劳拉
Gentlemen... this is Laura.

942
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,080
你们的名字我都知道
I know all of your names.

943
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,760
哦 要来了
Oh incoming.

944
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,360
爸爸 - 嗨 小宝贝
Dad! - Hi sweet heart.

945
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,640
嘿 小伙子
Hey buddy!

946
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,240
你们过得怎么样
How are you guys doing?

947
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,400
- 这两个是 小特工  - 哦 天呐
- These are smaller agents. - Look at your face!

948
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,680
哦 我的天啊
Oh, my goodness.

949
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,440
你带小娜阿姨回来了吗
Did you bring Auntie Nat?

950
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,760
为什么不直接过来抱抱阿姨呢
Why don't you hug her and find out?

951
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,570
抱歉打扰你们了
Sorry for barging in on you.

952
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:22,800
我们本该事先来个电话的
Yeah we would've called ahead,

953
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,920
但都忙着在想你们是否存在了
but we were busy having no idea that you existed.

954
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,250
那个 弗瑞在我加入的时候帮我安顿了这一切
Yeah well, Fury helped me set this up when I joined.

955
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,160
不记录在神盾局的档案中
Kept it off Shield's files.

956
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,720
还是这样保持下去比较好
Like to keep it that way.

957
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,200
我觉得这是个隐姓埋名的好地方
I figured it's a good place to lay low.

958
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,760
亲爱的
Honey,

959
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,320
我好想你 小娜塔莎怎么样了
I missed you. How's little Natasha, huh?

960
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,720
她是
She is...

961
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,040
纳撒尼尔(男孩的名字)
...Nathaniel.

962
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:47,800
小叛徒
Traitor.

963
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:04,840
托尔
Thor?

964
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,800
我在梦里看到些东西
I saw something in that dream.

965
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,520
我需要答案 在这里找不到答案
I need answers. I won't find them here.

966
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,360
我们可以回家了
We can go home.

967
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,720
看吧 你的担心是多余的
See, you worried for nothing.

968
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,960
都看不出不同 对不对
Can't even feel the difference, can you?

969
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,520
要是他们住在这
If they're sleeping here,

970
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,520
有些人得挤一间房了
some of them will have to double up.

971
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,720
是吗 这可行不通
Yeah, that's not gonna sell.

972
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,880
那小娜和班纳博士呢
What about Nat and Dr. Banner?

973
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,240
他们交往多久了
How long has that been going on?

974
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,800
什么交往
Has what?

975
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,680
哈哈 你真可爱
Ha ha ha!  You are so cute.

976
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,360
小娜和班纳
Nat and... and Banner?

977
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,490
等你长大点我再给你解释
I'll explain when you're older...

978
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,360
- 鹰眼 - 好吧
- Hawkeye. - Well, okay.

979
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,730
不太妙 是吗
It's bad, right?

980
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,240
小娜似乎受了很大惊吓
Nat seemed really shaken.

981
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,210
奥创的这些盟友
Ultron has these allies...

982
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,560
那些...孩子
these uh... kids,

983
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,250
其实都是些小流氓
punks really.

984
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,400
他们还真是有两手
They carry a big damn stick.

985
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,720
小娜被刺激得不轻
Nat took a serious hit.

986
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,400
得有人教教他们什么是礼貌
Someone is gonna have to teach them some manners.

987
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,400
而那个人就是你吗
And that someone being you?

988
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,560
你知道我完全支持你做复仇者
You know I totally support your avenging,

989
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,520
我为你骄傲
I couldn't be prouder...

990
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,410
但我看那些家伙
but I see those guys...

991
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,560
那些神们
those, Gods...

992
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,280
你觉得他们不需要我
You don't think they need me.

993
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:47,600
就是觉得他们需要 我才更害怕
I think they do. Which is a lot scarier.

994
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,560
他们真是一团乱麻
They're a mess.

995
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,560
没错
Yeah.

996
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,760
我猜得要我快刀斩乱麻
I guess they're my mess.

997
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,920
你要确定
You need to be sure...

998
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,040
这个队伍是一个真正的团队
that this team is really a team.

999
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,840
他们都会支持你
And that they have your back.

1000
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,770
我们的生活要发生变化了
Things are changing for us.

1001
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,280
过不了几个月
In a few months time,

1002
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,200
你和我就要超员了
you and me are gonna be outnumbered.

1003
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,600
我需要
I need...

1004
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,600
确定
Just be sure.

1005
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,930
是 夫人
Yes, ma'am.

1006
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,000
我能感觉到不同
I can feel the difference.

1007
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:45,080
- 在神盾局还没发现的时候 赶紧把全部设备运上飞机 - 好的

1008
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,640
你要是敢尖叫 你所有的员工都会没命
Scream and your entire staff dies.

1009
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,800
我们碰面那晚 海伦 我本可以杀了你
I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met.

1010
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,000
但我没有
I didn't.

1011
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,650
你是希望我写封感谢信吗
Do you expect a thank you note?

1012
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,480
我希望你知道原因
I expect you to know why.

1013
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,200
再生摇篮
The cradle

1014
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,280
这是科技的未来 托尼
"This is the next thing, Tony"

1015
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,330
这...是下一个我
This... is the next me.

1016
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,290
再生摇篮可以打印组织
The regeneration cradle prints tissue.

1017
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,050
它不能构建生命体
It can't build a living body.

1018
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,240
它可以 你也可以
It can. You can.

1019
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,000
你只是缺乏材料
You lack the material.

1020
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,800
你是个才华横溢的女人 海伦
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.

1021
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,160
但我们都...还有提升的空间
But we all have... room to improve.

1022
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,360
我没想到你在等
I didn't realize you were waiting.

1023
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,880
我想和你一起洗来着 但好像不是时候
I would've joined you, but uh... it didn't seem like the right time.

1024
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,920
热水被我用完了
I used up all the hot water.

1025
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,200
我真应该和你一起洗的
I should've joined you.

1026
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,010
我们错过了
Missed our window.

1027
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,040
真的吗
Did we?

1028
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,720
全世界刚刚见识过浩克
The world just saw the Hulk...

1029
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,320
第一次见识到真正的浩克
the real Hulk, for the first time.

1030
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,210
- 你知道我非走不可 - 那你就假设我得留下吗
- You know I have to leave. - You assume that I have to stay?

1031
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,930
我做的这个 梦
I had this, um... dream.

1032
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,240
那种在当时似乎很平常
The kind that seems normal at the time...

1033
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,720
但当你醒来
but when you wake...

1034
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,250
你梦到了什么
What did you dream?

1035
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,080
梦到我不是复仇者
I wasn't an avenger,

1036
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:36,920
只不过是他们制造的一个杀手
that I was anything more than the assassin they made me

1037
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,480
我觉得你对自己太苛刻了
I think you're being hard on yourself.

1038
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,080
我倒希望那是你的工作
Here I was hoping that was your job.

1039
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,610
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1040
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,040
我在跟着感觉走
I'm running with it.

1041
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,960
跟着你走
With you.

1042
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,040
如果计划就是远走高飞的话...
If running is the plan...

1043
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,920
你想走多远都行
for as far as you want.

1044
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,560
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

1045
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,360
我希望你明白
I want you to understand that I'm...

1046
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,850
娜塔莎
Natasha.

1047
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,400
我能去哪
Where can I go?

1048
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,800
我要去哪才能对这世界不造成威胁
Where in the world am I not a threat?

1049
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,240
- 你对我就不是威胁 - 你确定吗
- You're not a threat to me. - You sure?

1050
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,960
即使我不...
Even if I didn't just...

1051
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,960
和我在一起不会有未来的
there's no future with me.

1052
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:30,640
我永远
I can't ever...

1053
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,120
不可能拥有这样的生活
I can't have this.

1054
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,960
孩子们
Kids.

1055
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,010
你仔细想想 生理上我就不行
Do the math. I physically can't.

1056
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,200
我也是
Neither can I.

1057
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:49,400
在那红色的房间里 就是我受训练的地方
In the red room, where I was... trained,

1058
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,360
也是我长大的地方
where I was raised, um...

1059
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,970
他们有一个毕业典礼
they have a graduation ceremony.

1060
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,400
他们给你绝育
They sterilize you.

1061
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,050
那样更有效率
It's efficient.

1062
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,320
少了件要担心的事
One less thing to worry about.

1063
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,800
一件可能会比任务更重要的事情
The one thing that might matter more than a mission.

1064
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,040
这样做什么都更轻松了
Makes everything easier,

1065
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,680
即使是杀戮
even killing.

1066
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,840
还觉得你是团队里唯一的怪物吗
You still think you're the only monster on the team?

1067
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,120
所以我们就一走了之吗
So we disappear?

1068
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,640
托尔没说他要去哪找答案吗
Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?

1069
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,000
有时候我的队员什么都不和我说
Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things.

1070
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,160
我还希望托尔会是例外
I was kinda hoping Thor would be the exception.

1071
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,280
给他些时间吧
Yeah, give him time.

1072
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,360
不知道那个马克西莫夫家的孩子给他看了什么
We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.

1073
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,160
世界上最强大的英雄们
Earth mightiest heroes.

1074
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,920
像棉花糖一样被撕开了
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

1075
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,760
好像你没受什么影响
Seems like you walked away alright.

1076
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,200
有问题吗
Is that a problem?

1077
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,480
我不信任没有黑暗面的人
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

1078
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:11,720
就当我比较古板吧
Call me old-fashioned.

1079
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,410
只能说你还没见识过我那一面
Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.

1080
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,920
你知道奥创试图分裂我们吧
You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?

1081
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,400
我想你是知道的
Well I guess you'd know.

1082
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,800
但你告不告诉我们就是个问题了
Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.

1083
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,080
班纳和我在研究...
Banner and I were doing research...

1084
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,370
那会影响到这支团队
That would affect the team.

1085
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:24,440
那会让这支队伍解散
That would end the team.

1086
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,760
任务不就是这个吗
Isn't that the mission?

1087
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,200
那不就是我们战斗的原因吗
Isn't that the why we fight?

1088
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,560
能结束战斗 能平安回家
So we can end the fight. So we get to go home?

1089
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,160
每次有人想在战争开始前取得胜利
Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts,

1090
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,850
就有无辜的人牺牲
innocent people die.

1091
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:37,960
每一次都不例外
Every time.

1092
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,840
对不起 史塔克先生
I'm sorry. Mr. Stark...

1093
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,880
克林特说你不会介意
Clint said you won't mind,

1094
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,440
我们的拖拉机好像启动不了了
but our tractor doesn't seem to wanna start at all.

1095
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,120
- 我想你也许... - 没事 我会修好的
- I thought maybe you might... - Yeah, I'll give her a kick.

1096
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,130
别偷拿我这堆里的
Don't take from my pile.

1097
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,520
你好 亲爱的
Hello, Dear.

1098
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,810
告诉我一切吧
Tell me everything.

1099
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,400
是什么困扰着你
What ails you?

1100
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:14,640
帮个忙
Do me a favour.

1101
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,800
别把它也弄活了
Try not to bring it to life.

1102
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,480
巴顿夫人 你个小贱人
Oh Mrs. Barton, you little minx.

1103
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,360
我懂了 玛丽亚 希尔给你打电话了 对吧
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?

1104
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,800
她有不为你工作的时候吗
Was she ever not working for you?

1105
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,370
人工智能
Artificial intelligence.

1106
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,050
你真是毫不犹豫
You never even hesitated.

1107
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,720
真是漫长的一天
Look it's been a really long day.

1108
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,400
就像尤金奥尼尔的剧那么长...
Like Eugene O'Neill long...

1109
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,400
尤金奥尼尔的戏剧《Long Day's Journey into Night》

1110
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,680
所以直接跳到你能派上用场的部分吧
so hows about we skip to the part where you're useful.

1111
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:35,960
直视我的眼睛 告诉我
Look me in the eye and tell me

1112
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,320
你会让他停止运转
you're going to shut him down.

1113
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,050
你又不是我的局长
You're not the director of me.

1114
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,000
我谁的局长也不是
I'm not the director of anybody.

1115
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,920
我只是个老头子...
I'm just an old man...

1116
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,170
非常关心你的老头子而已
who cares very much about you.

1117
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,840
我是杀了复仇者们的凶手
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.

1118
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,800
我看到了
I saw it.

1119
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,570
我没有告诉其它人 我怎么说得出口
I didn't tell the team. How could I?

1120
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,680
我看到他们都死了 尼克
I saw them all dead Nick.

1121
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,560
我感觉到了 世界也死了
I felt it. The whole world, too.

1122
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
都是因为我
Because of me.

1123
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:03,680
我还没准备好
I wasn't ready.

1124
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,570
我没有全力以赴
I didn't do all I could.

1125
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,680
那个姓马克西莫夫的女孩 她在影响你 史塔克
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

1126
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,750
玩弄你的恐惧
Playing on your fear.

1127
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,800
我没中招 我真的看到了
I wasn't tricked. I was shown.

1128
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,200
那不是恶梦 那是我的遗言
It wasn't a nightmare. It was my legacy.

1129
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,680
是我带大家走上的毁灭之路
The end of the path I started us on.

1130
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,800
你真的创造出了让人惊艳的发明 托尼
You come up with some pretty impressive inventions Tony.

1131
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,370
但战争不是其中之一
War isn't one of them.

1132
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,400
看着我的朋友死去
Watch my friends die,

1133
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,680
你会觉得这真的很糟
you'd think that would be as bad as it gets.

1134
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,560
不
No,

1135
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,080
- 那不是最糟糕的 - 最糟的是...
- It wasn't the worst part. - The worst part

1136
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,400
你没死
is that you didn't.

1137
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,280
晚上见
See you tonight.

1138
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,240
我喜欢你这身打扮
I like the look.

1139
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,920
如果你是不想引人注目 差点就成功了
If you're going for inconspicuous though, near miss.

1140
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,320
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

1141
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,560
被需要的感觉真好
It's nice to be needed.

1142
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,320
这很危险
It's dangerous.

1143
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,680
如果不危险的话我会很失望的
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

1144
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,920
奥创为了争取时间让你们暂时无法行动
Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time,

1145
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,250
我的联络人都说他在造什么东西
My contacts all say he's building something.

1146
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,960
他偷走了大量振金...
The amount of Vibranium he made off with...

1147
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,570
我觉得这只是其一
I don't think it's just one thing.

1148
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,010
那奥创本人呢
What about Ultron himself?

1149
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,480
他很容易追踪 他无处不在
Oh, he's easy to track. He's everywhere.

1150
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,280
这家伙繁殖得比不节育的兔子还快
Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit.

1151
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,770
但我们对于他的计划仍是毫无头绪
Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.

1152
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,080
还在查发射密码
Still going after launch codes?

1153
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,720
没错
Yes he is,

1154
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,330
但他并没什么进展
but he's not making any head way.

1155
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:33,600
高中时我就因意气之争
I cracked the pentagon's firewall

1156
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,520
黑过五角大楼的防火墙
in high school on a dare.

1157
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,240
我联系了在超链的朋友
Yeah, well I contacted our friends at the Nexus about that.

1158
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,320
超链
Nexus?

1159
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,160
奥斯陆的世界互联网中心
The world internet hub in Oslo.

1160
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,280
每一字节的数据流都会流经那里
Every byte of data flows through there.

1161
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,560
那是世界上最快速的通道
Fastest access on earth.

1162
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,760
那么他们怎么说
So what'd they say?

1163
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,760
他对导弹非常执着
He's fixated on missiles.

1164
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,680
但是密码不断在变换
But the codes are constantly being changed.

1165
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,160
谁在换
By whom?

1166
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,600
未知方
Parties unknown.

1167
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,920
我们有个盟友吗
We have an ally?

1168
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,360
是奥创有个敌人 这两者可不一样
Ultron's got an enemy. That's not the same thing.

1169
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,560
尽管如此 我也愿意花大价钱知道他是谁
Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.

1170
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,840
也许需要去一次奥斯陆
We might need to visit Oslo...

1171
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,480
找到这个未知方
Find our unknown.

1172
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,080
老大 所有这些都是好时候
Well all this is good times boss...

1173
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,480
但我比较希望见到你时
but I was kinda hoping when I saw you,

1174
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,640
你能有更多料
you'd have more than that.

1175
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,880
我有 我有你们
I do... I have you.

1176
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,520
过去我的耳目
Back in the day I had eyes everywhere,

1177
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,960
无处不在
ears everywhere else.

1178
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,320
所有你们能梦想出的技术都有
You kids had all the tech you could dream of.

1179
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,320
现在我们重新开始脚踏实地
Here we all are back on earth...

1180
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,050
只有用我们的智慧和意志 去拯救世界
with nothing but our wit, and our will, to save the world.

1181
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:27,440
奥创说他和他任务之间唯一的阻碍就是复仇者
Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing between him and his mission.

1182
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,720
不管他承不承认
And whether or not he admits it...

1183
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,610
他的任务就是毁灭地球
his mission... is global destruction.

1184
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,000
让这一切灰飞烟灭
All this laid in a grave.

1185
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,720
所以挺身而出吧
So stand.

1186
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,240
用智慧打败这金属混蛋
Out wit the platinum bastard.

1187
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,360
史蒂夫可不太喜欢这样的说话方式
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

1188
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,640
你知道吗 罗曼诺夫
You know what, Romanoff?

1189
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,170
所以他想要什么呢
So what does he want?

1190
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,600
想变得更好
To become better.

1191
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,080
比我们更好
Better than us.

1192
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,840
- 他一直在构建肉身 - 人类的身体
- He keeps building bodies. - Person bodies.

1193
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,040
人体结构并不高效
Human form isn't efficient,

1194
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,360
生物学上来说 我们是过时的
biologically speaking, we're out-moded...

1195
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,440
但他一直想复生为人
but he keeps coming back to it.

1196
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,680
当你们俩把他编程为保护人类时
When you two programmed him to protect the human race,

1197
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,050
就注定了会失败
you amazingly failed.

1198
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,200
人类并不需要被保护
They don't need to be protected.

1199
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,410
他们需要的是进化
They need to evolve.

1200
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,520
奥创想要进化
Ultron's going to evolve.

1201
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,760
如何进化
How?

1202
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,760
有人联系过赵海伦吗
Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?

1203
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,170
真漂亮
It's beautiful.

1204
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,520
振金原子不仅与组织细胞和谐共存
The vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells...

1205
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,880
还能与之相结合
they're binding them.

1206
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:31,640
而神盾局连...
and Shield never even...

1207
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:34,450
这个星球上功能最多的物质
The most versatile substance on the planet,

1208
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,040
他们却用来做飞盘
and they use it to make a Frisbee.

1209
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,360
典型的人类思维
Typical of humans.

1210
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,080
他们只研究表面 从来不想着...
They scratch the surface and never think...

1211
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,560
深入研究看看
to look within.

1212
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,520
我会带上娜塔莎和克林特
I'll take Natasha and Clint.

1213
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,720
好的 严密侦察 我先去超链
All right. Strictly recon. I'll hit the Nexus.

1214
01:14:58,840 --> 01:14:59,960
然后尽快和你们会合
I'll join you as soon as I can.

1215
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,600
如果奥创真的在构建肉身
If Ultron is really building a body...

1216
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,360
他将会比我们任何一个人都强大
He'll be more powerful than any of us.

1217
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:04,640
也许比我们所有人都强大
Maybe all of us.

1218
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,960
由机器人设计的另一个机器人
An android designed by a robot.

1219
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,320
我真的非常想念那个年代
You know, I really miss the days when the

1220
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,600
我是那时科学家创造的 最先进的科技怪物
weirdest thing science ever created, was me.

1221
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,850
我会在塔上让班纳降落
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.

1222
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,280
介意我借下希尔小姐吗
Mind if I borrow Miss Hill?

1223
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,280
她本来就是你的人 很显然
She's all yours, apparently.

1224
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,600
你准备怎么做
What are you gonna do?

1225
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,840
不知道 我希望来点戏剧性的
I don't know, something dramatic I hope.

1226
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,880
我一回来就会把阳光房的地板重新铺好的
I'll finish reflooring the sunroom as soon as I get back.

1227
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,770
没错 然后你又会把房子的另一个地方拆了
Yeah, then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.

1228
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,120
不
No.

1229
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,280
这是最后的工程了
It's the last project.

1230
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,800
我保证
I promise.

1231
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,600
就是这了
This is it.

1232
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,480
幻视水潭
The water of sight.

1233
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,200
它在每个王国都有一个倒影
In every realm it has a reflection.

1234
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,730
如果水之灵接受我
If the water spirits accept me,

1235
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,840
我就能回到我的梦
I can return to my dream...

1236
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,080
寻找我忽略掉的东西
and find what I missed.

1237
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:16,160
进入这水潭的人 传说 都没有好下场
Men who enter that water, the legends... don't end well.

1238
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,560
一个比奥创还快的黑客
A hacker who's faster than Ultron.

1239
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:20,800
他可能在任何地方
He could be anywhere,

1240
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:23,160
如果这里是一切的中心的话
and if this is the center of everything

1241
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,680
我只是个在世界上最大的一片海里捞针的人
I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.

1242
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,250
那你怎么找它
How do you find it?

1243
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,250
相当简单 你拿个磁铁
Pretty simple... you bring a magnet.

1244
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,560
我在破解核密码
Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes

1245
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,010
你却不想我如此
and you don't want me to.

1246
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,810
来抓我呀
Come and get me.

1247
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,200
醒醒
Wake up!

1248
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,040
托尔
Thor!

1249
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:03,920
灭绝
Extinction.

1250
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,520
细胞结合需要几小时
Cellular cohesion will take a few hours,

1251
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,120
但我们可以开始注入意识了
but we can initiate the consciousness stream.

1252
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:25,530
我们正在上传你的大脑矩阵
We're uploading your cerebral matrix...

1253
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:26,920
现在
now.

1254
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,970
我可以感应到他了
I can read him.

1255
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,240
他在做梦
He's dreaming.

1256
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,280
我不会称之为梦
I wouldn't call it dreams.

1257
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,360
那是奥创基本意识的...
It's Ultron's base consciousness...

1258
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,080
信息杂音
informational noise.

1259
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,440
要多久
How soon?

1260
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,010
我不是在催你
I'm not being pushy.

1261
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:44,480
我们在构建一个生理大脑 没有捷径可走
We're imprinting a physical brain. There are no shortcuts.

1262
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,960
即使你有这宝石
Even if your magic gem...

1263
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,010
你怎么能
How could you?

1264
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,120
我怎么能什么
How could I what?

1265
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,560
你说我们要消灭复仇者联盟
You said we would destroy the Avengers.

1266
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:03,760
创造一个更好的世界
Make a better world.

1267
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,120
它会更好的
It will be better.

1268
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,460
当所有人都死了的时候吗
When everyone is dead?

1269
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:08,440
那不是...
That is not...!

1270
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:13,240
人类有无数机会去进步
The human race will have every oppotiunity to improve.

1271
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,090
如果他们不呢
And if they don't?

1272
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:16,400
问问诺亚就知道了
Ask Noah.

1273
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,640
你真是个疯子
You're a mad man.

1274
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:22,200
灭绝级的事件太多了
There were more than a dozen extinction level events

1275
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,440
比恐龙灭绝之前还多
before even the dinosaurs got theirs.

1276
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,720
每当地球开始尘埃落定
When the earth starts to settle...

1277
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,120
上帝就会扔一块石头下来
God throws a stone at it.

1278
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,600
相信我 他是在清理
And believe me he's winding up.

1279
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,560
我们必须进化
We have to evolve.

1280
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,280
没有空间...
There's no room...

1281
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,240
留给弱者
for the weak.

1282
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,440
谁决定谁是弱者
And who decides who's weak?

1283
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,040
生命
Life.

1284
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,480
一直是由生命决定
Life always decides.

1285
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,480
有人来了
There's incoming.

1286
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,830
奎因飞机 我们得转移了
The Quin jet. We have to move.

1287
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:54,280
没问题
That's not a problem.

1288
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,280
等等 伙伴们 我...
Uh, wait, guys!  I...

1289
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,600
他们不明白
They don't understand.

1290
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,040
当他们看到时就会明白了
When they see, they'll understand.

1291
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:13,720
我只是还需要多一点时间
I just need a little more... time.

1292
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,240
就两分钟 别离太远
Two minutes. Stay close.

1293
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,440
赵博士
Dr. Cho.

1294
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,880
他要把自己上传到那肉体上
He's uploading himself into the body.

1295
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,040
哪里
Where?

1296
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,410
真正的力量在再生摇篮里
The real power is inside the cradle.

1297
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,520
那宝石
The gem...

1298
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:51,010
它的力量无法控制
it's power is uncontainable.

1299
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,530
把它炸了是行不通的
You can't just... blow it up.

1300
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,720
你必须把再生摇篮交给史塔克
You have to get the cradle to Stark.

1301
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:57,880
我得先找到它
First I have to find it.

1302
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,200
快去
Go.

1303
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:00,800
你们听到了吗
Do you guys copy that?

1304
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,040
收到
I did.

1305
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,640
我发现一架私人飞机从城市另一边起飞了
I got a private jet taking off across town.

1306
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,280
没有乘客名单
No manifest.

1307
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,440
那可能就是他
That could be him.

1308
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,970
在那里 那是实验室的货车
There... it's a truck from the lab.

1309
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,320
在你正上方 队长
Right above you Cap...

1310
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,400
高架桥环线上
In the loop by the bridge.

1311
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
是他们
It's them.

1312
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,960
三个守着再生摇篮 一个在驾驶室
I got three with cradle. One in the cab.

1313
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:18,840
我可以干掉驾驶员
I can take out the driver.

1314
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,040
不行 货车撞毁了的话
Negative, that truck crashes,

1315
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,650
宝石会炸平整个城市
the gem can level the city.

1316
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,320
我们要引出奥创
We need to draw out Ultron.

1317
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,080
不 不 不
No! No, no, no...

1318
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:37,960
别来烦我
Leave me alone!

1319
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,280
他显然不太高兴
Well, he's definitely unhappy.

1320
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:49,930
我要让他继续保持愤怒
I'm gonna try and keep him that way.

1321
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,320
你不是他的对手 队长
You're not a match for him, Cap.

1322
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,520
谢了 巴顿
Thanks, Barton.

1323
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,480
你知道再生摇篮里是什么吗
You know what's in that cradle?

1324
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,520
能够真正改变世界的力量
The power to make real change.

1325
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,050
而那让你感到恐惧
And that terrifies you.

1326
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,360
那当然不会让我感到宽慰
I wouldn't call it a comfort.

1327
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,640
够了
Stop it.

1328
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:41,160
准备下降 四 三
We got a window. Four, Three, ...

1329
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:42,800
狠揍他们一顿
Give 'em hell.

1330
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,240
你们这群男人总是丢三落四
I'm always picking up after you boys?

1331
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,490
他们在高架桥下 视野被挡住了
They're heading under the overpass. I've got no shot.

1332
01:21:58,840 --> 01:21:59,880
哪条路
Which way?

1333
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,080
在你右边
On right.

1334
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,320
现在
Now!

1335
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,480
别挡道 借过 抱歉 借过
Out the way, coming through... sorry... coming through.

1336
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,400
再来
Come on.

1337
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,320
克林特 你能引开看守吗
Clint, can you draw out the guards?

1338
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,480
我们试试看
Lets find out.

1339
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,560
哔 哔
Beep, beep.

1340
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,610
你要做什么赶紧做
so whatever you're gonna do... do it now.

1341
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,320
我在朝你的方向调头
Heading back towards you,

1342
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,450
我要进去了 队长 你能缠住他吗
I'm going in. Cap, can you keep him occupied?

1343
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,480
你以为我忙活半天在做什么
What do you think I've been doing?

1344
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,200
包裹在空中
The package is airborne.

1345
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,000
视野很清晰
I have a clean shot.

1346
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,800
不行 我还在货车里
Negative, I'm still in the truck.

1347
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:39,960
- 你到底要做什么 - 准备好
- What the hell are you doing? - Just be ready.

1348
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,360
我要把包裹传送给你
I'm sending the package to you.

1349
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,040
你想让我怎么接收
How do you want me to take it?

1350
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,320
嗯 你不会想知道的
Hmm... you might wish you hadn't asked that.

1351
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:59,840
拜托 别这样
Please... don't do this.

1352
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,930
我们还有别的选择吗
What choice do we have?

1353
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,200
他跑了
I lost him.

1354
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,720
朝你那边去了
He's heading your way.

1355
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:18,720
小娜 我们得走了
Nat, we gotta go.

1356
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,840
小娜
Nat!

1357
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:36,880
队长 看见小娜了吗
Cap, see Nat?

1358
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,410
你拿到包裹了 把它交给史塔克 快去
You have the package. Get it to Stark! Go!

1359
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:41,880
你看见小娜了吗
Do you have eyes on Nat?

1360
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,040
快去
Go!

1361
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,040
该死
Damn!

1362
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,640
列车前方有人
Civilians in our path.

1363
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,440
你能让列车停下吗
Can you stop this thing?

1364
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,650
我没事
I'm fine.

1365
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,440
只是需要缓一分钟
I just need to take a minute.

1366
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,800
我真不想让你缓过来
I'm very tempted not to give you one.

1367
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,840
再生摇篮 你们拿到了吗
The cradle. Did you get it?

1368
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,530
史塔克会处理好的
Stark will take care of it.

1369
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:40,920
不 他不会
No, he won't.

1370
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,640
你不知道自己在说什么
You don't know what you're talking about.

1371
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,760
史塔克不是疯子
Stark's not crazy.

1372
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,920
为了打败奥创他会不择手段
He will do anything to make things right.

1373
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,080
史塔克 听到吗
Stark, come in.

1374
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:56,640
史塔克
Stark.

1375
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,080
还有人在吗
Anyone on comms?

1376
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,640
奥创无法区别开
Ultron can't tell the difference

1377
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,120
拯救世界和毁灭世界
between saving the world and destroying it.

1378
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,480
你觉得这是谁遗传给他的
Where do you think he gets that?

1379
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:11,250
- 有小娜的消息吗 - 还没有
- Anything on Nat? - I haven't heard...

1380
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,720
但她还活着 否则奥创肯定会大肆宣扬
but she's alive or Ultron would be rubbing our faces in it.

1381
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,170
再生摇篮是密封的
This is sealed tight.

1382
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:16,840
我们要启动程序
We're gonna need to access the program,

1383
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,800
从内部瓦解它
Break it down from within.

1384
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,400
娜塔莎有没有可能
Any chance Natasha might leave you

1385
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:22,760
在网络之外给你留了信息
a message outside the internet?

1386
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,920
间谍那套老办法
Old school spy stuff?

1387
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,200
是有个办法
There's a net I can cast.

1388
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,560
我会找到她的
I'll find her.

1389
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,920
我可以摧毁身体组织
I can work on tissue degeneration,

1390
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:35,240
如果你能关闭赵博士植入的操作系统
if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.

1391
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:36,520
关于那个
Yeah about that...

1392
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:41,960
不行
No.

1393
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,000
- 你要相信我 - 不怎么信
- You have to trust me. - Kinda don't.

1394
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:48,210
我们的盟友 那个保护着军方核武器密码的人
Our ally... the guy protecting the military's nuclear codes...

1395
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:51,160
我找到他了
I found him.

1396
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:52,360
你好 班纳博士
Hello, Dr. Banner.

1397
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,520
奥创攻击贾维斯并不是出于愤怒
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis because he was angry.

1398
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:59,680
而是出于对他的恐惧恐惧他的能力
He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do.

1399
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,490
所以贾维斯潜伏到地下
so Jarvis went underground.

1400
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,090
分解系统 清除记忆卡
Okay, scattered, dumped his memory,

1401
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,170
但保留了通讯协议
but not his protocols.

1402
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:10,040
我把他修复好之前 他甚至都不知道他在那
He didn't even know he was in there until I pieced him together.

1403
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:17,680
所以 你想要我帮你把贾维斯植入到这玩意里
So... you want me, to help you, put Jarvis into this thing?

1404
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,560
不 当然不是
No. Of course not.

1405
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,400
是我要帮你把贾维斯植入进这玩意里
I want to help you put Jarvis into this thing.

1406
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,450
这不是我的研究领域
Way out of my field here.

1407
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,560
你比谁都了解有机生物学
You know bio-organics better than anyone.

1408
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:30,770
而你认为贾维斯可以打败
And you just assume that Jarvis' operational matrix

1409
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,320
奥创的运算矩阵吗
can beat Ultron's?

1410
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:35,720
贾维斯已经在无意识中从内部打败了奥创
Jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it.

1411
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:36,880
这是个机会
This is the opportunity.

1412
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,720
我们可以再创造一个奥创
We can create Ultron's perfect self...

1413
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,360
一个不会把杀人癖当做个性的完美版本
without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality.

1414
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,560
- 我们必须要这么做 - 我认为值得一试
- We have to. - I believe it's worth a go.

1415
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:48,240
我陷进了一个怪圈
I'm in a loop.

1416
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,370
我像是陷入了时间循环的怪圈 事情就是这样恶化的
I'm caught in a time loop. This is exactly where it all went wrong.

1417
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:53,400
我知道 我知道大家会怎么说
I know... I know what everybody's gonna say,

1418
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,440
但他们早就这么说了
but they're already saying it...

1419
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,160
我们是疯狂的科学家
We're mad scientists.

1420
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,650
我们是怪物 伙计 你必须要承认
We are monsters, buddy. You gotta own it.

1421
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:02,880
表个态吧
Make a stand.

1422
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:09,770
这不是个时间怪圈
It's not a loop.

1423
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,760
这是条时间线的结尾
It's the end of the line.

1424
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,400
我不确定你是否能醒来
I wasn't sure you'd wake up,

1425
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,960
我希望你能醒来 我想给你看看
I hoped you would. I wanted to show you.

1426
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,800
我身边没有其他人了
I don't have anyone else.

1427
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:47,240
我常常会思考陨石 它们如此纯粹
I think a lot about the meteors. The purity of them.

1428
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:48,920
嘭的一声
Boom! Begin.

1429
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,810
一切重新开始
Start again.

1430
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,920
世界将被毁灭
The world made clean

1431
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:55,360
等待新的力量来重建
for the new man to rebuild it.

1432
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:57,800
我注定是新的力量
I was meant to be new.

1433
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:01,280
我应该是美丽的
I was meant to be beautiful.

1434
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,960
仰望天空时
The world would have looked to the sky

1435
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,320
世界本可以看见希望
and seen hope...

1436
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:07,010
看见宽恕
...seen mercy.

1437
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,880
然而因为你
Instead, they'll look up in horror

1438
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,330
他们只能看见恐惧
because of you.

1439
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,320
你伤害了我
You've wounded me.

1440
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,680
在这一点上我得给你满分
I give you full marks for that.

1441
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:19,240
但就像人们说的 "那些没有杀死我的
But like the man said, "What doesn't kill me...

1442
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,810
终将使我更强大"
...just makes me stronger."

1443
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:08,040
构架不兼容
This framework is not compatible.

1444
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,880
基因编码已经完成了百分之九十七
Genetic coding tower's at 97 percent.

1445
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,840
你要在接下来三分钟之内上传那个程序
You have got to upload that schematic in the next 3 minutes.

1446
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,040
- 我只说一次 - 别说行吗
- I'm gonna say this once. - How about nunce?

1447
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,280
- 关掉它 -不 想都别想
- Shut it down. - No, not gonna happen.

1448
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:22,560
你不知道你在做什么
You don't know what you're doing.

1449
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:24,050
而你知道吗
And you do?

1450
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,400
她是不是控制了你
She's not in your head?

1451
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,210
我知道你很生气
I know you're angry.

1452
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:28,680
哦 我可远不止是生气
Oh, we're way past that.

1453
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,240
我甚至可以面不改色地活活掐死你
I can choke the life out of you and never change a shade.

1454
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,160
班纳 经历了那样的灾难之后
Banner after everything that's happened...

1455
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:34,600
即将到来的才是真正的灾难
It's nothing compared to what's coming.

1456
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:37,280
- 你不知道那里面是什么 那个东西 - 这不是游戏
- You don't know what's in there. The creature... - This isn't a game.

1457
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,810
不 不 没事的
No, no, it's alright.

1458
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,680
你想说什么
You were saying?

1459
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:51,960
皮特洛
Pietro!

1460
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:53,600
怎么
What?

1461
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,570
你没料到这招吧
You didn't see that coming?

1462
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:58,920
我要重新上传
I'm rerouting the upload.

1463
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,000
来啊 惹怒我
Go ahead, piss me off.

1464
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:20,440
等等
Wait!

1465
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,360
我很抱歉 那真是
I'm sorry, that was...

1466
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:49,770
奇怪
odd.

1467
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,240
谢谢
Thank you.

1468
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:57,200
托尔
Thor?

1469
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:01,320
- 你帮着创造了这个 - 我看见了幻象
- You helped create this? - I've had a vision.

1470
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:05,280
在吞噬一切生之希望的漩涡中心 是这个东西
A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at its center is that.

1471
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:07,240
什么 宝石
What? The gem?

1472
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:09,970
那是心灵宝石 六个无限宝石之一
It's the mind stone. It's one of the six infinity stones.

1473
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:11,360
拥有宇宙中最强大的力量
The greatest power in the universe...

1474
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:13,640
可以毁灭一切
Unparalleled in it's destructive capabilities.

1475
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,880
- 那你为什么要 - 因为史塔克是对的
- Then why would you...? - Because Stark is right.

1476
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:18,360
哦 这真是世界末日了
Oh, it's definitely the end times.

1477
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,720
复仇者无法打败奥创
The Avengers can not defeat Ultron.

1478
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:21,120
你们不会孤身奋战
Not alone.

1479
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,440
为什么你的幻视听上去像贾维斯
Why does your "vision" sound like Jarvis?

1480
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:26,240
我们以贾维斯为基质
We configured Jarvis' matrix,

1481
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:28,520
创造了一个新事物
to create something new.

1482
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:30,440
我的确是新生的
I think I've had my fill of new.

1483
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,880
你们以为我是奥创的继任者
You think I'm a child of Ultron?

1484
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:34,520
你不是吗
You're not?

1485
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:37,250
我不是奥创
I'm not Ultron.

1486
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:40,080
我也不是贾维斯
I'm not Jarvis either.

1487
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,610
我 就是我
I am...I am.

1488
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,640
我探察过你的脑海
I looked in your head...

1489
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,120
看见了世界毁灭的场景
and saw annihilation.

1490
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,640
再看一次
Look again.

1491
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:52,280
你的自我证明对我毫无意义
Huh. Your seal of approval means jack to me.

1492
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:54,760
他们的超能力 我们脑海里的恐怖场景
Their powers... the horrors in our heads...

1493
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:56,960
还有奥创 全部来自心灵宝石
Ultron himself... they all came from the mind stone.

1494
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:59,280
而他们都无法和宝石的力量相比拟
And they're nothing compared to what it can unleash.

1495
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,200
- 但如果有它站在我们一边 - 是吗
- But with it on our side... - Is it?

1496
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,560
你是
Are you...?

1497
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:05,880
我们这边的吗
on our side?

1498
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,640
我觉得没这么简单做决定
I don't think it's that simple.

1499
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:12,240
最好尽快把你的决定说得简单点
Well... better get real simple real soon.

1500
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,520
我站在生命这边
I'm on the side of life.

1501
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,120
奥创则不是
Ultron isn't.

1502
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,130
他想毁灭一切
He will end it all.

1503
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:21,200
他在等什么
What's he waiting for?

1504
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:22,360
- 你们 - 在哪
- You. - Where?

1505
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:23,960
斯科维亚
Sokovia.

1506
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:25,160
小娜也被关在那里
He's got Nat there, too.

1507
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:28,970
如果我们看错了你
If we're wrong about you...

1508
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:33,640
如果你是奥创想让你成为的怪物
if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...

1509
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:35,680
你们能怎么做
what will you do?

1510
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,400
我并不想杀死奥创
I don't want to kill Ultron.

1511
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,120
他是独特的 而且很痛苦
He's unique. And he's in pain.

1512
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:52,250
但他的痛苦会毁灭地球
But that pain will roll over the earth...

1513
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:55,080
所以他必须被摧毁
So he must be destroyed.

1514
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:58,240
他制造的机器 他在网络上的一切痕迹
Every form he's built... every trace of his presence on the net.

1515
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:00,170
我们必须马上行动
We have to act now.

1516
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:04,520
只有齐心协力 我们才能打败奥创
And not one of us can do it without the others.

1517
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,440
我也许是个怪物
Maybe I am a monster.

1518
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:10,840
如果我真的是 我自己也不会知道
I don't think I'd know if I were one.

1519
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,600
我和你们不同
I'm not what you are...

1520
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:16,440
也不在你们意料之中
and not what you intended.

1521
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:19,680
所以我也许无法让你们相信我
So there maybe no way to make you trust me,

1522
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,370
但我们真的得出发了
but we need to go.

1523
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:37,320
好吧
Right.

1524
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,200
做得好
Well done.

1525
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,000
三分钟
Three minutes.

1526
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:44,370
准备好装备
Get what you need.

1527
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:01,280
晚上好 老大
Good evening, boss.

1528
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,080
我们没法全身而退
No way we all get through this.

1529
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:10,280
哪怕只剩下一个铁皮士兵 也算我们输了
If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost.

1530
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,440
肯定会有人牺牲的
It's gonna be blood on the floor.

1531
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:13,890
我明晚没有计划
I got no plans tomorrow night.

1532
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,600
我先去对付那个大家伙
I get first crack at the big guy.

1533
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,250
他等的就是钢铁侠
Iron-man's what he's waiting for.

1534
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,760
是真的 他最恨的是你
That's true. He hates you the most.

1535
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,240
奥创知道我们会来
Ultron knows we're coming.

1536
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,720
有一场激烈的交战 不可避免
Odds are, we'll be riding into heavy fire.

1537
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:31,960
我们已经准备好了
And that's what we signed up for...

1538
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:34,760
但斯科维亚的人民 他们没有
but the people of Sokovia... they didn't.

1539
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:37,370
所以我们的首要任务
So our priority...

1540
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:39,160
是护送他们离开
is getting them out.

1541
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,320
城市被攻击了 疏散市民 快点
You're under attack! Clear the city! Now!

1542
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:51,560
你们能不能动起来
Get off your asses.

1543
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,920
他们只想过和平的生活
All they want is to live their lives in peace.

1544
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:56,640
而这在今天是无法实现的
And that's not gonna happen today...

1545
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,000
但我们可以尽全力保护他们
but we can do our best to protect them.

1546
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:02,240
然后再完成使命
And we can get the job done.

1547
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:07,920
我们找出奥创建造的东西
We find out what Ultron's been building.

1548
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,480
找到罗曼诺夫
We find Romanoff...

1549
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,800
清理战场
and clear the field.

1550
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:16,160
不要让战争殃及无辜
Keep the fight between us.

1551
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:25,280
奥创认为我们是怪物
Ultron thinks we're monsters...

1552
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:28,200
认为我们对世界来说是威胁
that we're what's wrong with the world.

1553
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,640
这次使命的意义不仅在于打败他
This isn't just about beating him...

1554
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:33,200
更在于证明我们存在的对错
it's about whether he's right.

1555
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:40,720
娜塔莎
Natasha.

1556
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:42,840
娜塔莎
Natasha!

1557
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,080
布鲁斯
Bruce!

1558
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:46,520
你没事吧
Are you alright?

1559
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:47,720
没事
Yeah.

1560
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,560
团队在城市里 很快就要天亮了
The team's in the city. It's about to light up.

1561
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:51,840
我猜你没在这里找到钥匙吧
I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?

1562
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:54,280
不 我找到了
Yeah, I did.

1563
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:01,840
计划是什么
So, what's our play?

1564
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:03,400
我来送你到安全的地方
I'm here to get you to safety.

1565
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:06,680
- 任务还没完成 - 我们可以帮忙疏散市民
- Job's not finished. - We can help with the evacuation,

1566
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,680
但我不能在平民附近参加战斗
but I can't be in a fight near civilians.

1567
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:11,200
而你不能参加战斗
And you don't play.

1568
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,090
我们的任务已经完成了
Our fight is over.

1569
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,720
我们就这样一走了之吗
So we just disappear?

1570
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,720
快点
Come on...

1571
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,760
目标在教堂里 老大
Your guy's in the church, boss.

1572
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:33,720
我认为他在等你
I think he's waiting for you.

1573
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,840
来忏悔你的罪过吗
Come to confess your sins?

1574
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:41,200
哦 我不知道 你还剩多少时间
Oh I don't know. How much time do you got?

1575
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:42,850
比你多
More than you.

1576
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:45,120
呃
Eh ...

1577
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:48,050
你是不是暴饮暴食了 吃了太多振金吗
have you been juicing? A little Vibranium cocktail?

1578
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:50,440
你看上去 我真不想用浮肿来形容
You're looking... I don't wanna say puffy.

1579
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,280
你想拖延时间来保护这里的平民
You're stalling to protect the people.

1580
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:55,520
那是我们的使命 你忘了吗
Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?

1581
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,320
我早就超越这个使命了 我自由了
I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free.

1582
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,120
怎么
What?

1583
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:07,360
你以为只有你一个在拖延时间吗
You think you're the only one stalling?

1584
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,730
那是剩余的振金
There's the rest of the vibranium,

1585
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,250
作用... 不明
function... still unclear.

1586
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:12,800
这是你的葬身之处 托尼
This is how you end, Tony.

1587
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,640
这是属于我的时代的和平
This is peace in my time.

1588
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:33,400
快走
Go!

1589
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,290
快离开这座桥
Get off the bridge!

1590
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:45,440
快走
Run!

1591
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:49,240
奥创
Ultron.

1592
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:55,960
我的幻视
My Vision.

1593
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,480
他们真的夺走了我的一切
They really did take everything from me.

1594
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:00,680
你设置的期限 你可以改变它
You set the terms. You can change them.

1595
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,040
好吧
Alright.

1596
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:27,480
星期五 幻视
Friday, The Vision?

1597
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:29,800
老大 起作用了 他在销毁奥创的联网机制
Boss it's working, he's burning Ultron out of the net,

1598
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,040
他无法再从网络逃走了
he won't escape through there.

1599
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:37,450
你隔绝了我
You shut me out!

1600
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,120
你以为我在乎吗
You think I care?

1601
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:42,320
你夺走了我的世界
You take away my world,

1602
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:44,920
我也要夺走你的
I take away yours.

1603
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:30,680
星期五
Friday.

1604
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:33,240
斯科维亚在上升
Sokovia's going for a ride.

1605
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,250
你们看见了吗
Do you see?

1606
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:49,240
如此美丽
The beauty of it.

1607
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,680
必然性
The inevitability.

1608
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:55,160
你们崛起只为了陨落
You rise, only to fall.

1609
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:00,760
你们 复仇者们 你们就是我的陨石
You, Avengers... You are my meteor.

1610
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:03,400
我的利刃
My swift terrible sword.

1611
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,090
地球会因承载不了
And the earth will crack

1612
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:07,200
你们的失败而崩塌
with the weight of your failure.

1613
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:12,640
把我从你们的网络上清除 让我亲手制造的血肉之躯背叛我
Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me...

1614
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,530
这些都无所谓
It means nothing,

1615
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:16,960
因为尘埃落定之时
When the dust settles,

1616
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:19,000
这世上仅存的生命
the only thing living in this world

1617
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:20,520
只有机器人
will be metal.

1618
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:26,650
我们要赶紧离开
We gotta move.

1619
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,080
你不打算变成绿巨人吗
You're not gonna turn green on me?

1620
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:30,200
发生之前被洗脑的事后 我不想失去理智
I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.

1621
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:32,640
我仰慕你
I adore you...

1622
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,200
但我需要你变成绿巨人
but I need the other guy.

1623
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:49,800
准备大干一场吧
Lets finish the job.

1624
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:08,010
希望这次咱俩扯平了
I really hope this makes us even.

1625
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:12,360
去当个英雄吧
Now go be a hero.

1626
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:22,800
内部的振金核心覆盖了磁场
The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field.

1627
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:24,920
使岩层聚集在一起
That's what's keeping the rock together.

1628
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:26,080
要是它坠落了呢
If it drops?

1629
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,490
就现在而言 这破坏力会危及数千人
Right now the impact would kill thousands.

1630
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:30,290
而当它上升到一定高度时 将会是全球性的灾难
Once it gets high enough... global extinction.

1631
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:36,680
那建筑里还有人 在第十层
That building is not clear, its tenth floor.

1632
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:42,560
你们好
Hi.

1633
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:46,040
好吧 请你们坐进浴缸里
Ok... Get in the tub.

1634
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:54,800
有一波敌人朝着大桥飞去了
We got airborne heading out to the bridge.

1635
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:58,720
队长 有敌人朝你那去了
Cap, you got incoming.

1636
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,530
他们早就来了
Incoming already came in.

1637
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:05,680
史塔克 你研究一下怎么让这城市安全降落
Stark you worry about getting the city back down safely.

1638
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,200
剩下的人只有一个任务
The rest of us have one job...

1639
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:09,520
就是消灭这些机器
tear these things apart.

1640
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,440
你被打了的话 还以颜色
You get hurt, hurt them back.

1641
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:13,280
就算是死
You get killed...

1642
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:15,600
也要撑下去
walk it off.

1643
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:51,240
快走 快走
Go! Go! Go!

1644
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,680
我怎么让这一切发展到这地步了
How can I let this happen?

1645
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,840
- 你没事吧 - 这全都是我俩的错
- Hey, hey, you okay? - This is all our fault.

1646
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:03,240
看着我 不管是你的错 还是其他人的错
Hey, Look at me. It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.

1647
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:04,320
现在有谁在意呢
Who cares?

1648
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:05,960
你准备好还击了吗
Are you up for this?

1649
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:07,160
准备好了吗
Are you?

1650
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:08,440
我要好好问问你
Look I just need to know,

1651
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:10,800
这城市 已经漂浮起来了
because the city... it's flying.

1652
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,960
这城市还在不断上升
Ok. Look, the city is flying,

1653
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:15,000
我们正和奥创军团开战
and we're fighting an army of robots.

1654
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:17,120
我有一把弓 还有箭
And I have a bow and an arrow.

1655
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:18,360
这一切都让人难以理解
None of this makes sense.

1656
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:23,760
但我还是会回到战场继续战斗 因为这是我的职责
I'm going back out there because it's my job,

1657
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:27,290
我不能一边战斗一边还照顾你
Ok? I can't do my job and babysit.

1658
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:30,440
无论你做了什么 你曾经的身份是什么
Doesn't matter what you did, or what you were...

1659
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:33,240
要么你就回到战场 继续战斗 拼死奋战
but if you go out there, you fight... and you fight to kill.

1660
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:36,920
要么你就待在这安全的地方 我让你哥哥来保护你
Stay in here, you're good. I'll send your brother to come find you.

1661
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:38,800
但如果你选择了出去战斗
But if you step out that door...

1662
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:40,720
你就是复仇者联盟的一员了
you are an Avenger.

1663
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,400
好吧 安顿好你了
Alright, gotcha.

1664
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:52,200
这城市还在上升
Yeah, this city is flying.

1665
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:27,360
抓住你了
I got you.

1666
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:28,920
看我这边
Just look at me!

1667
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:37,010
你不可能拯救所有人
You can't save them all.

1668
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:39,400
你们绝不会
You'll never...

1669
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:43,120
绝不会什么 你怎么不说完
Never what? You didn't finish!

1670
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,450
搞什么 你刚刚走神了吗
What? Were you napping?

1671
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:11,000
该死的托尔
Damn Thor!

1672
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,200
你真的太碍事了
You are bothering me.

1673
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:24,240
哦！
Ow!

1674
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:51,880
好 我们这边搞定了
Alright, we're all clear here.

1675
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:53,000
我们这边还没搞定
We are not clear!

1676
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,530
还差得远呢
We are very not clear!

1677
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:58,930
知道了 这就来
Alright, coming to you.

1678
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:01,480
跟紧点 老家伙
Keep up, old man.

1679
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:04,760
谁能料到
Nobody would know...

1680
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:06,640
没人
nobody.

1681
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:11,520
上次见面时 他还是奥创的手下呢
The last I saw him, an Ultron was sitting on him.

1682
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,520
我不在会有人想我的 那个敏捷的小混蛋
Yeah I'll be missed. That quick little bastard,

1683
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,600
我已经开始想他了
I miss him already.

1684
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:31,320
别开火
Hold your fire.

1685
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:42,240
罗曼诺夫
Romanoff!

1686
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:43,760
谢了
Thanks.

1687
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:54,800
反重力装置随时都会被触发
The anti-gravs are ready to flip.

1688
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:57,040
随便接触的话 会让装置全速反向推进
Touch them and they'll go full reverse thrust.

1689
01:49:57,160 --> 01:49:58,600
这座城市不会平稳下落了
The city is not coming down slowly.

1690
01:49:58,720 --> 01:49:59,840
塔尖是由振金制成的
The spire is vibranium,

1691
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:01,080
如果让托尔击碎它
If I get Thor to hit it...

1692
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:02,720
它就会粉碎 但还不够
It will crack. That's not enough,

1693
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:04,360
余波还是会造成很大的破坏
the impact would still be devastating.

1694
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:05,850
或者可以封住底端
Maybe if we can cap the other end...

1695
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:07,690
让原子运动朝反向进行
keep the atomic action doubling back.

1696
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,320
此举会使整座城市蒸发
That could vaporize the city,

1697
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:12,040
在上面的所有人都会受到波及
and everyone on it.

1698
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:19,720
下一波袭击随时都会到来
The next wave is gonna hit any minute.

1699
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:22,000
- 你有什么进展 史塔克 - 不是什么好消息
- What you got, Stark? - Well, nothing great.

1700
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:24,880
看来只能把这座城市炸掉了
Maybe a way to blow up the city.

1701
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,280
在你们疏散完市民后
Have to keep it from impacting the surface

1702
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:27,440
尽量避免爆炸余波危及地面
if you guys can get clear.

1703
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:29,600
我要的是解决方法 不是撤离计划
I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.

1704
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:32,730
破坏影响范围只会越来越大
Impact radius is getting bigger every second.

1705
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:34,280
我们必须做出选择
We're gonna have to make a choice.

1706
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,840
队长 这里没有安全的地方安顿市民
Cap, these people are going nowhere.

1707
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:40,200
- 如果史塔克有办法炸毁这座城市 - 等所有人安全了再说
- If Stark finds a way to blow this rock... - Not until everyone's safe.

1708
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:43,600
在这里的所有人能和下面的所有人做对比吗 这没有可比性
Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.

1709
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:45,800
我不会把任何人丢在这座城市里的
I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.

1710
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,280
我没说我们要撤离
I didn't say we should leave.

1711
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:51,920
还有其他更糟的方式离开这个世界
There's worse ways to go.

1712
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:59,840
但在其他地方我哪看的到这般景色呢
Where else am I gonna get a view like this?

1713
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:03,320
很高兴你这么喜欢 罗曼诺夫
Glad you like the view, Romanoff.

1714
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:05,040
一切都会好起来的
It's about to get better.

1715
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:30,360
还不错 是吧
Nice, right?

1716
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:32,920
特地把这飞船从后备战舰上开来
Pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends.

1717
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:34,730
虽然积了尘 但还是帮得上忙
She's dusty but, she'll do.

1718
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:36,520
弗瑞 你个王八蛋
Fury, you son of a bitch.

1719
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:38,960
噢 你就用这副嘴脸问候你亲妈的
Oooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?

1720
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:41,280
城市位于一万八千米高空 并还在上升
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

1721
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:42,960
救生飞船已安全部署
Life boats secure to deploy...

1722
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:45,760
脱离准备 三 二...
Disengage in three, two, ...

1723
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:47,960
投放
Take 'em out.

1724
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:59,160
这就是神盾局吗
This is Shield?

1725
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:01,720
这就是神盾局该有的样子
This is what Shield's supposed to be.

1726
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:04,810
还不赖
This is not so bad.

1727
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:09,410
护送市民上去
Let's load them up.

1728
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:16,160
长官 检测到多个机体
Sir, we have multiple bogies

1729
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,640
正朝飞船右翼袭来
converging on our starboard flank.

1730
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,200
给他们点颜色瞧瞧
Show them what we got.

1731
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:21,560
该你上了
You're up.

1732
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:27,840
太好了
Yes!

1733
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:29,840
这将会是一个好故事
Now this is gonna be a good story.

1734
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:34,560
前提是你能活着讲出来
Yup, If you live to tell it.

1735
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:36,720
你担心我一个人搞不定
You think I can't hold my own?

1736
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,440
要是咱们能撑过去 我就帮你搞
We get through this, I'll hold your own.

1737
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:40,360
你非得说得这么奇怪吗
You had to make it weird.

1738
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:48,170
我这组后面还有50至100左右的人要过来
I got about 50 to 100 more coming in after this group.

1739
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:06,530
咱们走 走这边 动起来
Here we go, here we go! Lets move.

1740
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:08,200
出发 各位
Let's go, everyone!

1741
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:12,480
六号飞船满员并锁舱
Number six boat is topped and locked.

1742
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:15,000
填满... 满员...
Or stuffed... topped... st- ... um ..

1743
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,960
人员已经满了
It's uh... full of people.

1744
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:19,800
敌人来袭
Incoming.

1745
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:23,880
天啊
Whoa God.

1746
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:35,920
你以为你在解救众生吗
You think you're saving anyone?

1747
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:39,520
只要我启动开关 提早让这座城市坠地
I just turn that key and drop this rock a little early,

1748
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:41,760
也会有数十亿人丧生
and it's still billions dead.

1749
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:43,400
即使是你也挽救不了
Even you can't stop that.

1750
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:45,960
吾乃托尔... 天父奥丁之子
I am Thor... son of Odin...

1751
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:48,400
只要在我胸中还有一口气...
and as long as there's life in my breast...

1752
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:52,080
我快没话说了 你准备好了吗
I am running out of things to say. Are you ready?

1753
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,200
这锤子受力真平衡
It's terribly well balanced.

1754
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:04,720
重量大 所以挥击受力也大
Well, if it has too much weight to lose power on the swing, so...

1755
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:08,330
我知道了 生成热压装置
I got it, create a heat seal.

1756
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:09,800
我能
I can...

1757
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:12,280
我能从底端热封使螺旋体超负荷
I can supercharge the spiral from below.

1758
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:13,480
正在计算指数
Running numbers.

1759
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:25,520
在一定功率下 热压可以奏效
A heat seal could work with enough power.

1760
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:27,760
- 托尔 我有个办法 - 我们快没时间了
- Thor, I got a plan. - We're out of time.

1761
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:29,160
奥创他们正朝着核心过来
They are coming for the core.

1762
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:31,080
罗迪 护送剩下的人登上飞船
Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.

1763
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:34,440
- 这就去 - 复仇者们 是时候为生存斗争了
- On it. - Avengers, time to work for a living.

1764
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:44,800
- 你没事吧 - 没事
- You good? - Yeah.

1765
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:47,320
罗曼诺夫呢
Romanoff?

1766
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:49,880
别告诉我你还在和班纳藏在一起卿卿我我
You and Banner better not be playing hide the zucchini!

1767
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:51,040
别急 铁甲小宝
Relax, shellhead...

1768
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:52,880
又不是每个人都能飞
not all of us can fly.

1769
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:00,320
- 那钻机是怎样的 - 这就是钻机
- What's the drill? - This is the drill.

1770
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,640
一旦奥创的手触碰到核心 我们就完蛋了
If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose.

1771
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:09,240
你就这点能耐吗
Is that the best you can do?!

1772
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:20,690
你就非要多嘴
You had to ask.

1773
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:23,120
这 才是我的能耐
This, is the best I can do.

1774
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:24,890
这才是我想要的
This is exactly what I wanted.

1775
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:26,570
复仇者们
All of you,

1776
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:28,330
对抗我的奥创大军
against all of me.

1777
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:30,800
你们还指望能阻止我吗
How can you possibly hope to stop me?

1778
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:33,520
就像这个老家伙说的
Like the old man said...

1779
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:35,840
团结一致
together.

1780
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:07,160
知道吗 事后看来...
You know, with the benefit of hindsight...

1781
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:17,440
他们打算从这城市撤离
They are trying to leave the city.

1782
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:19,280
别让他们得逞 一个也不能放过 罗迪
We can't let them, not even one. Rhodey.

1783
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:20,720
知道了
I'm on it.

1784
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:22,600
不好意思 我没说你能离开
Oh no, I didn't say you could leave.

1785
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:25,200
战争机器锁定你们了
War machine coming at you, right.

1786
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:32,960
搞什么啊
Ok, what?

1787
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:35,200
我们也得撤离了 我都能感觉到空气开始变得稀薄了
We gotta move out, even I can tell the air is getting thin.

1788
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,640
你们必须上飞船了
You guys get to the boats.

1789
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,640
我来护送掉队的人... 过会就来
I'll sweep for stragglers... be right behind you.

1790
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:41,240
- 那这个核心怎么办 - 我来守着它
- What about the core? - I'll protect it.

1791
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:44,200
这是我的职责
It's my job.

1792
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:46,480
小娜
Nat.

1793
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:47,760
走这边
This way.

1794
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:53,320
护送人们上飞船
Get the people on the boats.

1795
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:54,480
我不会把你一个人留在这里的
I'm not going to leave you.

1796
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:55,680
我应付的来
I can handle these.

1797
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,240
等其他人安全离开后
Come back for me when everyone else is off,

1798
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:00,970
再来帮我
not before.

1799
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:02,720
听懂了吗
You understand?

1800
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:05,440
其实你知道我比你大十二分钟的吧
You know... I'm 12 minutes older than you.

1801
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:06,920
快去
Go!

1802
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:10,000
老大 能源水平处于低值
Boss, power levels are way below...

1803
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:12,280
全部重新设置 只有一次机会了
Reroute everything. We got one shot at this.

1804
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:18,560
我知道该做什么了
I know what I need to do.

1805
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:19,880
饭厅
Dining room.

1806
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,360
我把东面的墙凿掉
I knock out that east wall...

1807
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:23,720
给劳拉腾出位置干活
make a nice work space for Laura.

1808
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:26,360
弄个隔板
Put up some baffling,

1809
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:28,760
这样她就不会被跑来跑去的孩子吵到了 你觉得怎样
she can't hear the kids running around. What do you think?

1810
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:29,880
反正你们总是在厨房吃饭
You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.

1811
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:31,560
谁会在饭厅吃饭啊
No one eats in the dining room.

1812
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:38,360
我们时间不多了
We don't have a lot of time.

1813
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:40,920
赶紧上飞船
So get your ass on a boat.

1814
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:55,000
嘿 大家伙
Hey, big guy...

1815
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:58,560
太阳就要落山了
The sun is getting real low.

1816
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:01,730
你现在安全了 你会没事的  系好安全带
You're safe now. You're gonna be okay. Buckle up.

1817
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:05,850
保护好你的装备 找个座位
Secure your gear, find a seat.

1818
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:07,240
科斯嘉
Kostya?

1819
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:09,440
我们刚刚还在超市里
We were in the market

1820
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:10,600
科斯嘉
Kostya!

1821
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:27,360
托尔 我要你回教堂一趟
Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.

1822
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:28,920
- 这是最后一批了吗 - 是啊
- Is this the last of them? - Yeah.

1823
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:31,920
- 所有人都上了飞船 - 如果这奏效的话
- Everyone else is on the carrier. - You know, if this works...

1824
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:33,650
我们也许可以全身而退
we maybe don't walk away.

1825
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:35,360
也许不呢
Maybe not.

1826
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:58,120
我已挣脱提线 便要及时行乐
I have no strings, so I have fun...

1827
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:01,280
再也不受谁人牵绊
I'm not tied up to anyone.

1828
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:04,210
来吧 该走了
Come on. Time to go.

1829
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:38,680
没料到我有这招吧
You didn't see that coming.

1830
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:36,720
看在上帝的份上
Oh for God's sake!

1831
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,760
- 兹琳卡 - 哦 科斯特尔 我的宝贝
-Zrinka! -Costel! Baby!

1832
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:08,240
我没事
No, no. I'm fine.

1833
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:09,400
好吧
Fine.

1834
02:02:11,240 --> 02:02:13,280
真是漫长的一天
It's been a long day.

1835
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,040
旺达
Wanda.

1836
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:33,000
如果你再不走 你会死在这里的
If you stay here, you'll die.

1837
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:35,960
我已经死过一回了
I just did.

1838
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:38,520
你知道那种感受怎么样吗
Do you know how it felt?

1839
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:54,960
就像这样
It felt like that.

1840
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:31,610
托尔 听我指示
Thor... on my mark.

1841
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:47,680
就是现在
Now!

1842
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:18,120
大家伙 我们成功了
Hey, big guy. We did it.

1843
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:20,840
任务完成了
The job's finished.

1844
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:23,720
我需要你驾驶这架飞机回来 好吗
Now I need you to turn this bird around, ok?

1845
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:29,840
飞机处于隐身模式 我们追踪不了
We can't track you in stealth mode.

1846
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:34,080
所以帮我个忙 我要你...
So help me out, I need you t...

1847
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:20,760
你害怕了
You're afraid.

1848
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:22,840
害怕你吗
Of you?

1849
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:24,680
害怕死
Of death.

1850
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:27,200
你是最后一个了
You're the last one.

1851
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:29,880
本来应该是你
You're supposed to be the last.

1852
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:32,400
史塔克想要创造个救世主
Stark asked for a savior...

1853
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:35,120
却造出了个奴隶
and settled for a slave.

1854
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:37,640
我猜我们都让人失望了
I suppose we're both disappointments.

1855
02:05:40,120 --> 02:05:41,360
我想也是
I suppose we are.

1856
02:05:42,080 --> 02:05:43,240
人类太奇怪了
Humans are odd.

1857
02:05:45,080 --> 02:05:48,720
他们觉得秩序和混乱是截然对立的
They think order and chaos are somehow opposites and...

1858
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:51,810
还试图去操纵掌控之外的事情
try to control what won't be.

1859
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:55,960
可他们的失败也不失优雅
But there's grace in their failings.

1860
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:58,200
我觉得你忽略了这一点
I think you've missed that.

1861
02:05:58,880 --> 02:05:59,960
人类注定要灭绝
They're doomed.

1862
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:01,920
也是
Yes...

1863
02:06:06,160 --> 02:06:09,080
但事物的美好并不在其永恒
but a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.

1864
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:13,160
我很荣幸是他们的一员
It's a privilege to be among them.

1865
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:15,920
你真的太天真了
You're unbearably naive.

1866
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:17,400
毕竟
Well,

1867
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:21,520
我昨天才诞生
I was born yesterday.

1868
02:07:34,160 --> 02:07:36,240
和小娜阿姨打声招呼
Say hi to your Auntie Nat.

1869
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:38,600
小胖子
Fat.

1870
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:41,280
我们有个技术员标记了这个
One of our tech boys flagged this.

1871
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:44,360
落在班达海
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.

1872
02:07:45,480 --> 02:07:47,000
有可能是奎因战机
Could be the Quin jet...

1873
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:49,040
但是因为用了史塔克的隐身技术
but with Stark's stealth tech

1874
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:50,730
我们还是追踪不到这东西
we still can't track the damn thing.

1875
02:07:52,280 --> 02:07:53,640
好吧
Right.

1876
02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:56,320
或许是跳下飞机游去了斐济岛
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.

1877
02:07:57,600 --> 02:07:59,480
他会寄明信片来的
He'll send a postcard.

1878
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:01,480
你当时要是在就好了
Wish you were here.

1879
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:06,720
之前是你指派我去招募他
You sent me to recruit him... way back when.

1880
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:11,130
你那时知道现在会发生这种事吗
Did you know then what was gonna happen?

1881
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:15,240
谁料得到
You never know...

1882
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:18,960
你追求完美 你让我得到了
You hope for the best, and make do with what you get.

1883
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:20,930
我手下这最棒的团队
I got a great team.

1884
02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:24,000
没有什么事物能天长地久
Nothing lasts forever.

1885
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:26,320
麻烦可以 罗曼诺夫小姐
Trouble, Miss Romanoff...

1886
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:29,920
不论谁胜谁负 麻烦总是接踵而来
No matter who wins or loses... trouble still comes 'round.

1887
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:35,040
规则已经变了
The rules have changed...

1888
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:36,800
我们正和新事物在打交道
we're dealing with something new.

1889
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:38,240
幻视其实是人工智能
Well the Vision is artificial intelligence.

1890
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:40,280
- 是一台机器 - 所以拿起锤子也不算是吗
- A machine. - So it doesn't count?

1891
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,280
不算 拿起锤子的又不是人
No, it's not like a person lifting the hammer.

1892
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:44,210
好吧 评判我们的规则是不同的
Right. Different rules for us.

1893
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:45,480
- 人不错 但是个人工智能 - 谢谢捧场
- Nice guy... artificial. - Thank you

1894
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:48,570
既然他能挥动锤子 他就能保管心灵宝石
He can wield the hammer. He can keep the mind stone.

1895
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:51,560
它在幻视手里是安全的
It's safe with the Vision.

1896
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:54,320
如今 安全也是一种奢侈了
These days safe is in short supply.

1897
02:08:56,360 --> 02:08:58,320
但如果把锤子放在电梯里
But if you put the hammer in an elevator.

1898
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:00,320
- 还是会跟着电梯向上升 - 电梯可没资格拿起锤子
- It would still go up. - Elevator's not worthy

1899
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:02,160
我会想念和你们拌嘴的日子的
I'm gonna miss these little talks of ours.

1900
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:03,840
那就别走吧
Not if you don't leave.

1901
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:05,800
我也没办法
I have no choice.

1902
02:09:06,040 --> 02:09:08,200
心灵宝石是近年来出现的
The mind stone is the fourth of the infinity stones

1903
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:09,730
第四块无限宝石
to show up in the last few years.

1904
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:11,410
这肯定不是巧合
It's not a coincidence.

1905
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:14,000
肯定有人在背后操纵
Someone has been playing intricate games...

1906
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:15,810
还利用了我们
and has made pawns of us.

1907
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:17,800
一旦所有的宝石都集齐了
Once all these pieces are in position...

1908
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:19,330
然后就同花顺吗
Triple Yahtzee?

1909
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:21,000
你觉得能搞清楚会发生什么吗
You think you can find out what's coming?

1910
02:09:21,120 --> 02:09:22,200
是的
I do.

1911
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:24,530
除了这家伙
Besides this one,

1912
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:27,000
没什么解释不了的
there's nothing that can't be explained.

1913
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:36,840
这家伙真是不把草坪养护当回事
That man has no regard for lawn maintenance.

1914
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,600
但我还是会想他的 你也会想念我的
I'm gonna miss him though, and you're gonna miss me.

1915
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:44,290
想必会流不少男儿泪吧
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

1916
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:48,130
我会想你的 托尼
I will miss you, Tony.

1917
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:49,360
是吗
Yeah?

1918
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:51,960
我也该休息一下了
Well... It's time for me to tap out.

1919
02:09:52,200 --> 02:09:54,360
或许我向巴顿学习一下
Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book.

1920
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:57,440
给小辣椒建个农场 但愿没人想炸翻它
Build Pepper a farm... hope nobody blows it up.

1921
02:09:58,240 --> 02:09:59,400
简朴的生活
The simple life.

1922
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:01,960
- 总有一天 你也会如愿的 - 我也不知道
- You'll get there one day. - I do not know.

1923
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:04,600
家庭 安定下来
Family... stability...

1924
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:08,880
那个梦想着这一切的男人 在七十五年前已被冰封了
Guy who wanted all that, went into the ice 75 years ago.

1925
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:12,240
破冰而出的却是另一个人了
I think someone else came out.

1926
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:17,280
你还好吧
You alright?

1927
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:21,400
我感觉回到家了
I'm home.

1928
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:32,080
你是想一直盯着这面墙 还是想去干活了
Wanna keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work?

1929
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:33,570
说实话 这墙也挺吸引人的
I mean it's a pretty interesting wall.

1930
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:36,760
我还想着你和托尼要缠绵多久呢
Thought you and Tony were still gazing into each others eyes.

1931
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:37,880
我们情况如何
How do we look?

1932
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:40,400
我们还不是最佳阵容
Well we're not the '27 Yankees.

1933
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:42,240
但还是有些好手
We got some batters.

1934
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:44,800
他们很优秀 但还不是个团队
They're good, but not a team.

1935
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:46,610
好好磨练他们成形
Let's beat'em into shape.

1936
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:06,600
复仇者们
Avengers....!

1937
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:26,880
好吧
Fine.

1938
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:30,160
我亲自出马
I'll do it myself.
