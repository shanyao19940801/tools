没错  但吃了我不就睡着了
Yeah, but then I'd be sleeping.

60

又做梦了
Dreams again?

00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,390

Wanna fight?

Right, you slipped

64
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,460
因为我一拳打在了你脸上
as a result of me punching you in the face.

65

你打到我脸的时候
I was already slipping

66
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,570
我就已经要滑倒了
when you happened to punch me in the face.

67
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,060
这两件事毫不相关
The two events were not related.

68
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,250
跟我说说这个梦
Tell me about this dream.

69
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,280
-有什么新内容吗  -没有
- Anything new? - No.

70
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,710
你必须放下过去
You have to let go of the past.

71
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,000
我不记得我的过去了
I don't remember my past.

72
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,460
这让你产生怀疑
It's causing you doubt,

73
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,590
怀疑让你有弱点
and doubt makes you vulnerable.

74
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,860
控制住
Control it.

75
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,520
如果你再次失控
Lose control again,

76
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,000
就得去找至高智慧密谈了
and you'll have to commune with the Supreme Intelligence.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,080
对于战士而言  情绪是最危险的
There's nothing more dangerous to a warrior than emotion.

78
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,520
幽默使人分心
Humor is a distraction.

79
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,790
而愤怒
And anger?

80
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,790
愤怒只会帮助你的敌人
Anger only serves the enemy.

81
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,240
距最后一次斯库鲁侵袭已过去了120天
One hundred twenty days since the last Skrull attack.

00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,820
有人见过
Has anyone ever seen

83
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,900
至高智慧的真面目吗
what the Supreme Intelligence really looks like?

84
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,090
没人能看到至高智慧的真面目
No one can look upon the Supreme Intelligence in its true form.

85
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,970
你知道的
You know that.

86
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,700
我们的潜意识会选择我们所能看到的形象
Our subconscious chooses the way they appear to us.

87
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,120
因此它是神圣的
So it's sacred.

88
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,050
也是私密的
It's personal.

89
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,230
克里人绝对不会泄露这个秘密
No Kree divulges it, ever.

90
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,740
你会看到谁
Who do you see?

91
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,520
-你哥哥吗  -不是
- Your brother? - No.

92
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,880
-父亲  -不是
- Father? - No.

93
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,170
-你以前的指挥官  -弗斯
- Your old commander? - Vers.

94
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,810
你看到的是我  对吧
It's me you see, isn't it?

95
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,230
我知道你想干什么
I see what you're trying to do.

96
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,110
-这招有用吗  -有用
- Is it working? - Yes.

97
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,920
但你别想转移话题
But you won't succeed in changing the subject.

98
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,390
如果你不希望我使用这力量
What is the point of giving me these...

99
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,020
那还何必把它给我
if you don't want me to use them?

100
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,410
我希望你使用这力量
I want you to use them.

101
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,700
至高智慧让我负责
The Supreme Intelligence gave me a responsibility...

102
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,950
教会你如何使用这力量
of showing you how to use them.

103
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,900
我知道怎么用
I know how.

104
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,710
如果你真会用
Yeah, if that were true,

105
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,360
就能不用它也可以打倒我了
you'd be able to knock me down without them.

106
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,600
控制你的冲动
Control your impulses.

107
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,360
不要用这儿  而是用这儿
Stop using this, start using this.

108
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,350
我希望你成为最好的自己
I want you to be the best version of yourself.

你的指挥官坚称你已可以服役
Your commander insists that you're fit to serve.

112
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,660
是的
I am.

113
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,870
你在苦苦纠结你的情绪
You struggle with your emotions...

114
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,840
和你的过去  这助长了它们
with your past, which fuels them.

115
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,570
你只是斯库鲁扩张的受害者之一
You are just one victim of the Skrull expansion...

116
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,840
几世纪以来  他们一直威胁着我们的文明
that has threatened our civilization for centuries.

117
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,930
这些卧底暗中潜入
Imposters who silently infiltrate...

118
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,140
然后占领我们的星球
then take over our planets.

119
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,670
你只记得些许可怕之事
Horrors that you remember...

120
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,550
而大部分已忘却
and so much that you do not.

121
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,430
我的人生一片空白
It's all blank. My life.

122
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,020
你的形象应该是
You're supposed to take the form

123
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,780
我最钦佩的人
of who I most admire...

124
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,440
但我甚至都不记得这人是我的什么人了
but I don't even remember who this person was to me.

125
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,230
或许这样也好
Perhaps this is a mercy

126
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,890
让你免受更多痛苦
sparing you from a deeper pain.

127
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,520
让你放开手脚去做所有克里人该做之事
Freeing you to do what all Kree must...

128
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,790
将人民的需求置于自身之上
Put your people's needs before your own.

129
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,380
我们赐予了你伟大的赠礼
We've given you a great gift.

130
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,720
一个为全体克里人而战的机会
The chance to fight for the good of all Kree.

131
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,820
我想要尽忠
I want to serve.

132
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,610
那就学会自控
Then master yourself.

133
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,200
赐予你的也能收回
What was given can be taken away.

134
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,220
我不会让你失望的
I won't let you down.

135
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,930
我们很快就会见分晓了
We'll know soon enough.

136
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,420
你有一项任务
You have a mission.

137
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,310
尽职尽忠  恪守荣耀
Serve well, and with honor.

138
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,710
一定是出大事了
This can't be good.

139
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,690
肯定又是斯库鲁侵袭
Must be another Skrull attack.

140
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,360
反正是大事
Whatever it is, it's big.

141
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,720
有斯库鲁人模仿过你吗
Has a Skrull ever simmed you?

142
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,820
有过一次
Once.

143
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,820
-让我深感不安  -为什么
- It was deeply disturbing. - Why?

144
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,390
因为当我凝视死敌之时
Because I stared into the face of my mortal enemy...

145
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,390
看到的却是我自己
and the face staring back was my own.

146
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,690
也许你要是再帅点
Maybe if you were more attractive,

147
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,540
就不会那么不安了
then it would be less disturbing.

148
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,950
你觉得自己很幽默  可我并不觉得好笑
You think you're funny, but I'm not laughing.

149
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,950
你从来不笑
You never laugh.

150
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,470
我只是笑不外露
I laugh on the inside.

151
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,210
我现在并没笑
I'm not doing that now.

152
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,870
说来好笑  因为客观来讲
It's funny 'cause, objectively speaking,

153
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
你还挺帅的
you're quite handsome.

154
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,870

160
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,160

This time, Torfa.

161
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,600
索拉发来了警告
Soh-Larr sent us a warning.

162
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,950

The signal was intercepted, and his cover's blown.

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,390

00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,120
如果他们在我们之前找到他
Should they reach him before we do...

166
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
那他这三年来收集的情报
the intelligence he's acquired over three years

167
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,680
就等于送给他们了
is as good as theirs.

168
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,160
指控者将轰炸南部这里的一个斯库鲁要塞

我们潜入  找到索拉

170
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,450
然后出来  神不知鬼不觉
and we get out, leaving them none the wiser.

171
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,400
托法人
The Torfan populace.

172
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,420
我们不要干扰他们
We are not to interfere with them,

173
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,270
也不要被他们缠住
nor them with us.

174
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,200
我们任务的机密性是第一位的
Nothing compromises the security of our mission.

175
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,940
务必万分小心
Proceed with caution.

176
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,430
撤离他前遵循规程
Follow protocol before extracting him.

177
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,690
此次任务很危险
This is a dangerous mission.

178
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,110
我们要做好加入大集体的准备
We must all be ready to join the Collective

179
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,160
若那是我们今日的命数

180
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,460
为全体克里人而战
For the good of all Kree.

181
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,120
为全体克里人而战
For the good of all Kree!

182
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,670
弗斯  追踪索拉的信标
Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon.

183
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,700
阿特拉斯  米涅瓦  找到高地
Att-Lass, Minn-Erva, find elevation.

184
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,550
外围有本地人
Locals on the periphery.

185
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,600
可能有十几个

186
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960

190
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,610
不  这里太适合伏击了
No. This is a perfect spot for an ambush.

191
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,300
只有一条路进出
Only one way in, only one way out.

192
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,650
我们可以绕过本地人
We can get past the locals.

193
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,280
我们都不能确定他们是否真是本地人
We don't know if they are locals.

194
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,470
太冒险
Too risky.

195
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,640
你不用跟我一起去  我可以自己去
You don't have to go with me. I'll go alone.

196
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,030
不  不行
No, you won't.

197
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,940
好吧  我们不要走远
Right. We keep a close radius.

198
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,000
如果断联  就回氦核飞船碰头
We lose comms, we meet back at the Helion.

199

走吧
Come on.

00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,400
他们是本地人  我发现两具尸体  没有绿血
They're locals. I found two dead. No green.

212
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,740
他们只是饿了
They're just starving.

213
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,010

218
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,890
弗斯  斯库鲁人
Vers? Skrulls.

219
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,260
是埋伏
It's an ambush.

220
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,520
敌舰
Incoming!

221
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,380
回氦核飞船去
Back to the Helion.

222

我可以告诉你我的秘密
How about I tell you my secret...

227
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,130

when you've told me yours?

00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,760
敞开她吧
Let's open her up.

229
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,980
我们在哪

230

就绪
Stand by.

231
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,700
你想什么呢[脑袋在哪]
Where's your head at?

232
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,940
想云彩[胡思乱想]  你呢
In the clouds. Where's yours?

233
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,350
在我肩膀上
On my shoulders.

234
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,390
要让这些男的见识一下我们的本事

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,540
更高  更远  更快啊  亲爱的
Higher, further, faster, baby.

237
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,710
没错
That's right.

238
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,100
这不对
This can't be right.

239
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,220
再往前倒
Go back even further.

240
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,490
你开太快了  你得慢点
You're going too fast! You need to go slow!

241
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,230
这人是谁  我们找对...
Who is this person? Are we in the right...?

242
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,590
你怎么想的
What the hell are you thinking?

243
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,540
你不该来这里
You don't belong out here!

244
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,100
我们好像倒得太多了
I think we went back too far.

245
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,550
你让他开了
You let him drive.

246

我试试吧
Let me try something.

247

放弃吧
Give up already!

248
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,690
你不该来这里
You don't belong out here!

249
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,110
你不够强壮
You're not strong enough.

250
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,780
你会害死自己的
You'll kill yourself.

251
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,780
他们绝不会让你飞的
They'll never let you fly.

252
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,820
只有我一个人看糊涂了吗
Am I the only one that's confused here?

253
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,410
你是个好飞行员
You're a decent pilot.

254
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,090
但你太情绪化
But you're too emotional.

255
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,160
你知道那为什么叫驾驶舱[屌坑]吧
You do know why they call it a cockpit, don't you?

256
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,490
一声贯穿宇宙的巨响  震动了月亮
A huge rumble throughout the cosmos shook the moon...

257
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,880
太阳  和天上的星星
and the sun and the stars in the sky.

258
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,590
于是
And so,

259

小阿露蒂整夜飞上天空

你看到她了吗  那是小阿露蒂

给我进来  该吃饭了

她一般不怎么亲近人的
She doesn't typically take to people.

268
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,660
你起得好早
Early start to your morning.

269
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,880
其实是晚上熬夜了
Late night, actually.

270
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,840
还有工作  我就睡不着
I can't sleep when there's work to do.

271
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,900
耳熟吗
Sound familiar?

272
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,080
我从不觉得飞行是工作
Flying your planes never feels like work.

273
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,830
风景很棒  是吧
Wonderful view, isn't it?

274
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,620
我更喜欢上面的风景
I prefer the view from up there.

275
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,090
你很快就能上去了  王牌
You'll get there soon enough, Ace.

276
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,450
等等  就是她  倒回去

282
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,830

What's that on her shirt?

283
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,200
我看不清
I couldn't read it.

284
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,700
风景很棒  是吧
Wonderful view, isn't it?

285
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,180
我更喜欢上面的风景
I prefer the view from up there.

286
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,600

00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,730
-你很快就能上去了  王牌  -往下看
- You'll get there soon enough, Ace. - Look down.

289

集中精神
Focus.

290
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,930
"飞马计划  温迪·劳森博士"  就是她
"Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson." That's her.

291
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,810
你也能听到吗
Do you hear that, too?

292
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,420
定位了吗
Do we have her location?

293
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,640
找到了
Got it.

294
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,160
追踪劳森  直到找到能量信号

有趣
Interesting.

296
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,750
等等
Hold on.

297
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,220
倒回到这之前  回去
Go back right before this. Go back.

298
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,440
那可不是米格  劳森
That's no MiG, Lawson.

299
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,750
就是这个  让我看看你要去哪
This is it. Now let me see where you're headed.

300
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,430
没错  看看坐标
That's right. Look at the coordinates.

301
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,730
集中精神

请敞开头脑
Open, please.

303
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,630

307
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,790
把她拉回来  快点
Get her back! Get her back now!

308
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,450
这没道理
This doesn't make any sense.

309
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,880
我们拿到任何可以行动的情报了吗
Do we have any information we can act on?

310
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,970
只知道劳森在C53星球上某处
Just that Lawson was somewhere on planet C-53.

311
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,250
我们这就去
We're on our way.

312
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,570
那就再继续深挖
Then dig, dig, dig deeper.

313

劳森能带我们找到光速引擎

314
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,550
和我们想要的一切
And everything we're after.

315
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,910
刚刚那下有用
That did something.

316
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,410
再来
Try that again.

317
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,340
不行
Not yet!

318
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,070
你对我做了什么
What did you do to me?

319
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,610
我们只是想要点情报
Now we're just after a little information.

320
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,300
你往我脑袋里放了什么
What did you put in my head?

00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,930
是啊  就像嗑错了药  是吧
Yeah, it's like a bad trip, isn't it?

324

怪不得你稀里糊涂的
I'm not surprised you can't keep it straight.

他们真把你祸害得不轻
They really did a number on you.

326
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,760
少跟我玩心理战
Enough of your mind games.

327
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,570

我们在找一位劳森博士
We're looking for the location of a Dr. Lawson...

329
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,700

330
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,360
我不认识什么劳森博士
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

331
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:48,720

你们不会刚好知道

这就走了
You leaving so soon?

338
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,900
我们才刚认识
We're just getting to know each other.

00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,720
弗斯呼叫星际战队指挥部  收到吗

这里是C53吗

你听懂了吗  我的宇宙翻译器好使吧

你负责这一带的安全吗
Are you in charge of security for this district?

算是吧  影院有自己的保安

追踪飞行舱  找到那姑娘

我很好  多谢关心

你找到索拉了吗
Did you find Soh-Larr?

364
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,620
那根本不是索拉
It wasn't Soh-Larr.

365
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,100
是塔罗斯模仿了他  连他的密码都知道
Talos simmed him. Even knew his code.

366
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,540
那不可能
That's impossible.

367
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,350
那密码是在他的潜意识里的
That code was buried in his unconscious.

368
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,710
斯库鲁人动了我的大脑
The Skrulls messed with my mind.

369
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,570
他们用的那台机器
The machine that they used...

370
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,400
我觉得他们就是那样得知了索拉的密码
I think it's how they extracted Soh-Larr's code.

371

00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,610
她是个科学家

380
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,600
他们觉得她研发出了光速科技
They think that she's cracked the code on light-speed tech.

381
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,880
我得赶在他们之前找到她
I have to get to her before they do...

382
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,910
否则他们就能入侵新星系了
or else they'll be able to invade new galaxies.

383
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,290
不  你已经被抓到一次了
No. You've been caught once already.

384
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,630
C53离我们多远

385
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,520
离最近的跳跃点有22小时的路程

386

387

保持通讯器在线  以便我们联系你

388
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,010

389
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,030
很抱歉
We're sorry.

390
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,130

弗斯
Vers?

396
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,390
如果斯库鲁人控制了她的心智
If the Skrulls got to her,

397
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,900
她就不能被信任了
she's compromised.

398
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,670
她比你想的要坚强
She's stronger than you think.

399
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,520
去过C53吗
Ever been to C-53?

去过一次
Once.

401
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,170
破地方
It's a real shithole.

402
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,230
新人  去跟那个保安谈谈
Rookie! Go talk to the rent-a-cop.

403

405
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,670
打扰  小姐
Excuse me, miss.

406
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,430
你知道有位女士把那边的
You know anything about a lady blowing a hole

407
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,150
百视达屋顶轰了个洞吗

408
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,450
证人说她穿了一身激光枪战的衣服
Witness says she was dressed for laser tag.

409

嗯  我觉得她去那边了
Yeah, I think she went that way.

410
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,900
我想问你些问题
I'd like to ask you some questions.

411
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:28,290
或许教教你怎么用深夜投件箱
Maybe give you the 411 on the late-night drop box.

412
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,660
可以出示身份证吗
Could I see some identification, please?

413
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,480
弗斯  克里星际战队
Vers. Kree Starforce.

414
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,770
我们不把身份证明写在小纸片上
We don't carry our identification on little cards.

415
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,880
弗斯
Vers?

416
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,310
星际战队
Starforce?

417
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,070
你打算在这里待多久
How long you plan to be in town?

418
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,340
等我找到
I'll be out of your hair...

419
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,520
正在潜入你们星球的斯库鲁人
as soon as I track down the Skrulls

420
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,470
我就会离开了
that are infiltrating your planet.

421
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,750
斯库鲁人
Skrulls?

422
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,560
变形者
Shapeshifters?

423
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,610
他们能变形成任何生命形式  连DNA也能复制
They can transform into any life-form down to the DNA.

424
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,300
天呐  你们完全不知道  是吧
Oh, boy. You guys don't have any clue, do you?

425
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,880
等等
Hold on.

426
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:04,580
我们怎么知道你不是那种变形者

你总算问了个有用的问题

00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,610

432
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,930
新人  我们走
Rook, let's roll!

433
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,930
你看到她的武器了吗
Did you see her weapon?

434
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,950
没有
I did not.

435
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,880

嫌疑人在北行列车上  正在追赶

439
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,110
放开
Get off!

440
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,040
列车前面要进隧道了
Train's heading for a tunnel up ahead.

441
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,700
我们去车站接他们
Let's greet them at the station.

442
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,460
弗瑞先生  这里是科尔森特工
Mr. Fury, this is Agent Coulson.

443
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:01,160
我还在百视达呢
I'm still here at the Blockbuster. And, uh,

444
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,710
大家都哪去了
where'd everybody go?

445
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,950
我已经完成证据收集了
I finished collecting evidence...

446
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,720
快叫救护车
We need an ambulance!

447
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,470
谁打下911
Someone call 911!

448
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:44,800
神盾局官方行动  别过来
Official S.H.I.E.L.D. activity. Stay back.

449
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,290
潜水衣挺酷
Nice scuba suit.

450
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,120
幽默点嘛  亲爱的
Lighten up, honey, huh?

451
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,160
能给我笑笑吗
Got a smile for me?

452
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,300
怪胎
Freak.

453
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:12,790
所有地球上的生命都是碳基的  但他不是
All life on Earth is carbon-based. Not this guy.

454
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,610
不管他是什么做的
Whatever he runs on,

455
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:17,110
反正周期表上没有
it's not on the periodic table.

456
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,770
你是说  他不是这里的
You're saying he's not from around here?

457
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,200
你的眼睛怎么样了
How's your eye?

458
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,920
眼睛倒没事
Well, I'd say fine...

459
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,650
就是不敢相信我看到的东西
but it can't believe what it's seeing.

460
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:35,600
你说这玩意之前是科尔森的样子
You say this thing looked like Coulson?

461
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,100
说话也像
Talked like him, too.

462
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,180
那女人说还有更多这种人
And the woman said that there were more?

463
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,480
她说的是"潜入"
The word she used was "infiltration."

464
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,580
你相信她吗
You believe her?

465
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,280
直到见到这个才信
Not till I saw this.

466
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,340
你有什么打算
What's your plan?

467
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,980
我能找到那个百视达姑娘
I'll find Blockbuster girl.

468
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,940
有桩摩托车盗窃的报案
I got word on a motorcycle thief

469
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,550
女贼符合她的描述
that fits her description.

470
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,460
如果她能说出这些蜥蜴人为什么来
If she can tell us why these lizards are here...

471
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,550
或许她也能告诉我们怎么赶走他们
maybe she can tell us how to kick 'em to the curb.

472
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,560
好
Good.

473
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,940
但你自己行动  我们谁都不能信任
Do it alone, though. We can't trust anyone.

474
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,200
连我们自己人都不行

他们可真丑  是吧
They're ugly bastards, aren't they?

477
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,710
是啊  可不比布拉德·皮特  长官

安然超度吧  我的朋友

一个机场

飞马计划在哪

那是机密
That's classified.

487
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,100
我给你建立的档案也是

但看来你还换装了
But I see you've changed it up a bit since then.

垃圾摇滚挺衬你

你今天不顺吗  弗瑞特工

遭遇了太空入侵  大型追车

你看到一个了
So you saw one?

496
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,290
我并不怎么信外星人
I was never one to believe in aliens...

但那画面我是忘不掉了
but I can't unsee that.

498
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,410
这会比较尴尬  但我必须问

499

你觉得我也是那种绿玩意
You think I'm one of those green things.

500
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,070
小心驶得万年船
Can't be too careful.

501
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:48,160
我可是百分百的红血地球人
You are looking at 100% red-blooded Earth man.

502
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,630
我恐怕需要点证明
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.

503
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,720
你是想验唾液还是验尿
We talking cheek swab or urine sample?

504
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,560
不  DNA也会一样的
No. The DNA would match.

505
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,800
那我的美国在线密码呢
Want my AOL password?

506
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,120
斯库鲁人只能模仿宿主的近期记忆
Skrulls can only sim recent memories of their host bodies.

507
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,870
你想聊私事

说出一个非常怪异
Name a detail so bizarre

527

如果一片吐司被对角切开  我就不能吃了
If toast is cut diagonally, I can't eat it.

00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,880
这怎么就能向我证明
And how is that supposed to prove to me

534
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,430

好吧  斯库鲁人能模仿外星种族

以潜入并夺取星球

544

我能辨认得出一个擅自行动的士兵

劳森的光速引擎图纸

612
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:45,170
他们为什么中止了这个项目呢
I wonder why they terminated the project.

613
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:48,370
或许是因为她
Maybe because she's

614
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,170
疯了
cuckoo.

615
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,850

所以这里的保安才那么不友好

624
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:17,400
他们在掩盖一个价值十亿的过失

625

你的光速引擎也烧毁了

626
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,250
坠机什么时候发生的
When did this crash happen?

627
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,960
六年前  1989年
Six years ago. 1989.

628
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:33,460
飞行员是谁
Who was the pilot?

629
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,960
大部分文件都编辑过了
Most of this thing's redacted...

630
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,850
但这里有一份玛利亚·兰博的证词
but there is a testimonial here from a Maria Rambeau.

631
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,850
她是最后见到活着的她们的人
Last person to see them alive.

632
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,380
你没事吧
You okay?

633
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,300
马上回来
Back in a minute.

634
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:28,500
这不是为了作战
This isn't about fighting wars.

635
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:30,580
而是为了结束战争
It's about ending them.

636
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,970
我知道劳森是克里人
I know Lawson was Kree.

637
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:40,970
她就在C53星球上  而且死于坠机
She was here on C-53 and died in a plane crash.

638
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:43,000
你对此知情吗
Do you know anything about this?

639
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:46,980
我刚发现了一份C53发来的任务报告
I just discovered a mission report sent from C-53.

640
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:50,850
我有权告诉你的不多  弗斯  但是
There's only so much I'm cleared to tell you, Vers, but...

641
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:58,760
劳森是一名卧底克里特工  名叫玛威尔
Lawson was an undercover Kree operative named Mar-Vell.

642
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,270
她在研究一种独特的能量核
She was working on a unique energy core.

643
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,040
实验一种据说可以
Experimenting with tech that apparently

644
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,700
助我们赢下战争的科技
could help us win the war.

645
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,200
她还在吗
She still here?

646
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,540
她在配合调查  长官
She's cooperating with the investigation, sir.

647
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,880
-你们留下  -是  长官
- You men stay here. - Yes, sir.

648
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,550
我要单独审讯她
I want to question her alone.

649
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,540
干得漂亮  尼古拉斯
Excellent work, Nicholas.

650
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,080
上面提到我了吗
Does it say anything about me?

651
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,330
提到你  当然没有
Anything about you? No, of course not.

652
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:34,430
怎么会呢
Why would it?

653
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:37,610
我找到证据  表明我曾在这里生活
I found evidence that I had a life here.

654
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,290
在C53上吗
On C-53?

655
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,880
我去见至高智慧时  看到的就是玛威尔
Mar-Vell is who I see when I visit the Supreme Intelligence.

656
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:48,300
我认识她  我认识身为劳森的她
I knew her. And I knew her as Lawson.

657
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,620
这更像是斯库鲁人的模仿  弗斯
This sounds like Skrull simulation, Vers.

658
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,600
不  不是  因为我记得  我来过这里
No, it's not. Because I remember. I was here.

659
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:54,470
停下  记住你的训练
Stop. Remember your training.

660
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:56,580
了解你的敌人  你也可能是你的敌人
Know your enemy. It could be you.

661
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:00,180
别被情绪影响了你的判断力
Do not let your emotions override your judgment.

662
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:03,340
她在地下六层
She's on sublevel six.

663
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,580
我在五层下
I'll get off on five...

664
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,910
走楼梯  以防她企图逃跑
and take the stairs in case she makes a run for it.

665
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,500
像我们在哈瓦那时那样  两面夹击
Do a pincer move like we did in Havana.

666
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,490
对
Right.

667
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,790
就像在哈瓦那时那样
Like we did in Havana.

668
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:26,460
我们快到跳跃点了
We're nearing the jump point.

669
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,530
别关信标  让我们能找到你
Leave your beacon on so I can find you.

670
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:30,600
我们会查清真相的  弗斯
We'll get to the bottom of this, Vers.

671
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,320
我们一起
Together.

672
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,400
好
Okay.

673
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,530
弗斯
Vers!

674
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,640
弗斯
Vers!

675
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:17,680
弗瑞在与目标串通
Fury's colluding with the target.

676
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,920
那他为什么要叫支援
Then why would he call us in?

677
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,390
我只知道他也要抓
All I know is we take him in, too.

678
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:21,510
不论死活
Dead or alive.

679
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,680
不论死活
Dead or alive?

680
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:38,960
上上
Go. Go, go!

681
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:53,300
是我说错了什么吗
Was it something I said?

682
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:36,280
其实  我并不需要这个也能看见
Now, you know, I don't really need these to see...

683
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:40,670
但这身打扮少不了它
but they do kinda complete the look.

684
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,850
是不是
Don't you think?

685
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:01,380
你叫他们来的
You called them in?

686
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,660
我不好
My bad.

687
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,030
科尔森  你发现他们了吗
Coulson, do you have eyes on them?

688
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,190
他们不在下面
They're not down here.

689
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,580
我们上楼吧
Let's try up there.

690
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:33,800
-什么  -你的通讯器
- What? - Your communicator.

691
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,660
在你手里显然不安全
You obviously can't be trusted with it.

692
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,160
你会飞这玩意吗
Do you know how to fly this thing?

693
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:09,450
试试便知
We'll see.

694
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:11,690
回答会不会就行了
That's a yes or no question.

695
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,560
会
Yes.

696
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,500
这就对了
That's what I'm talking about!

697
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:50,190
我们有个偷渡者
We got a stowaway.

698
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:55,190
撑住  咕咕
Hang on, Goose.

699
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:01,680
咕咕
Goose.

700
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,700
不  咕咕
No, Goose.

701
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,740
谁是只乖喵喵
Who's a good kitty, huh?

702
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:09,900
咕咕
Goose?

703
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:12,500
没错
Yes, that's right.

704
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,570
谁是只乖喵喵  咕咕
Who's a good kitty, Goose?

705
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:15,660
你是只乖喵喵
You the good kitty, that's right.

706
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,300
看到认识的人了吗
See anyone you know?

707
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,900
说来好笑
Funny story.

708
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,930
我奄奄一息地被送到哈拉  失去了记忆
I arrived on Hala near dead. No memory.

709
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,210
那是六年前的事
That was six years ago.

710
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:28,230
所以你觉得你是那个
So, you think you're the pilot

711
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:29,730
跟劳森博士一起坠机的飞行员
that went down with Dr. Lawson?

712
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,580
我是说  最后见到活着的她们的人
I'm saying the last person to see them alive

713
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,100
或许能告诉我们
could probably tell us.

714
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,580
玛利亚·兰博
Maria Rambeau?

715
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:37,090
我们怎么去路易斯安那州
So, how do we get to Louisiana?

716
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,400
往东飞  在孟菲斯右转
Due east. Hang a right at Memphis.

717
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:42,990
那个特工
That agent...

718
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,950
阻止了斯库鲁人找到我们的那个
that stopped the Skrulls from finding us?

719
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:47,500
科尔森  新来的
Coulson. The new guy.

720
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:49,650
看来他还不恨我
I guess he doesn't hate me yet.

721
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:51,390
是啊  给他时间吧
Yeah, well, give him time.

722
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:55,110
看来他是有种感觉
I guess he had a feeling, you know?

723
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:57,110
于是听从了直觉  而违抗命令
Went with his gut against orders.

724
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,940
这是很难做到的
That's a really hard thing to do.

725
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:01,080
但也是我们的人性
But it's what keeps us human.

726
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,450
我经常为此惹麻烦呢
I get in trouble for that. A lot.

727
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,240
这我看出来了
I can see that about you.

728
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:09,430
营救把你出卖给斯库鲁人的家伙
Rescuing the guy who sold you out to the Skrulls?

729
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:13,160
那不是标准的克里人行动规章吧
I'm guessing that's not standard Kree operating procedure.

730
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,490
如果你不向我上级打小报告  那我也不说
Well, I won't tell your boss if you don't tell mine.

731
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,680
罗南
Ronan.

732
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:26,730
指控者已完成了行动
The Accusers completed their operation...

733
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:29,310
但因为你们小队  更重要的任务失败了
but the greater mission was a failure, thanks to your team.

734
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,740
那是个陷阱
It was a trap

735
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,930
是为引诱我们的特工弗斯到托法  好绑架她
to lure our operative Vers to Torfa and kidnap her.

736
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:35,010
告诉我们地点
Give us their location.

737
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:36,760
我们会解决恐怖分子威胁
We'll take care of the terrorist threat.

738
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,640
你要把他们炸出银河系吗
By bombing them out of the galaxy?

739
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:42,080
不  我们来解决
No, we'll handle this.

740
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,960
不论在哪  一小撮斯库鲁人
A cell of Skrulls anywhere

741
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,250
对所有克里人都是威胁
is a threat to Kree everywhere.

742
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:47,380
他们在哪
Where are they?

743
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,760
-他们...  -不见了
- They are... - Lost.

744
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,490
暂时下落不明
They are lost for now.

745
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,390
但我们会找到他们的
But we will find them.

746
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,620
那去吧
Do so,

747
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:58,330
否则我们就接手
or we will.

748
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,430
继续航向C53
Maintain the course for C-53.

749
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,860
打扰  我找玛利亚·兰博
Excuse me, I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

750
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,600
卡罗尔阿姨
Auntie Carol?

751
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,810
妈妈  是卡罗尔阿姨
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

752
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:35,350
我就知道  大家都说你死了
I knew it! Everyone said you were dead!

753
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,260
但我们知道他们说谎了
But we knew they were lying.

754
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:41,840
我不是你以为的那个人
I'm not really who you think I am.

755
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:53,100
这是我听过的最疯狂的故事了
That is the craziest shit I ever heard.

756
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,210
会变形的绿外星人  没有这种事
Green transforming aliens? There's no such thing.

757
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,850
你说得太对了  小姑娘
You are absolutely right, young lady.

758
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,490
是没有这种事
There is no such thing.

759
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:00,900
因为即便有
'Cause if there were,

760
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:03,590
我们也不会想说出去
we would want to keep that to ourselves.

761
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:04,850
你不信吗
You don't believe me?

762
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,340
不会吧
No way!

763
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,970
好酷啊
That's so cool!

764
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:19,220
她的手可不止能泡茶呢
She can do a lot more than make tea with those hands.

765
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,740
比如呢  露两手
Like what? Show us.

766
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:22,310
待会儿的吧
Maybe later.

767
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:24,340
你的东西我都还留着呢
I kept all your stuff.

768
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,480
我去拿
I'll go get it.

769
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,360
你要去帮帮她吗
You want to give her a hand with that?

770
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,470
你什么都不记得了
You don't remember anything?

771
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,480
我会看到些片段
I see flashes.

772
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,980
一些时刻
Little moments.

773
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,530
但我不知道那是不是真的
But I can't tell what's real.

774
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:01,600
如果我可以把那天早上发生的事拼凑起来
If I could just piece together what happened that morning...

775
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,760
或许就都能说得通了
maybe it'll all make sense.

776
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:11,420
你破晓时猛敲我的门  把我吵醒了
You woke me up banging on my door at dawn.

777
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:12,890
你总这样
Your usual move.

778
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,160
当时  我们必须起得很早
Back then, we had to get up so early.

779
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,280
空军还是不许女性飞战斗任务
The Air Force still wasn't letting women fly combat...

780
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,750
所以  为劳森测试飞机是我们
so testing Lawson's planes was our only shot

781
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,240
唯一能做点要紧事的机会
at doing something that mattered.

782
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,240
你想开你的老野马飙车去基地
You wanted to race to base in your old Mustang...

783
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:27,300
我并不想跟你争
and I wasn't about to argue,

784
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,170
因为我知道我的科迈罗稳赢不输
'cause I knew my Camaro would dominate.

785
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:31,520
但你作弊了  走了捷径
But you cheated, took a shortcut.

786
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:32,790
捷径怎么就算作弊了
Since when is a shortcut cheating?

787
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:35,270
因为那有违预定的交战规则
Since it violates the predetermined rules of engagement.

788
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:37,120
这我可绝对不记得
I definitely don't remember those.

789
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:38,590
当然了
Of course you don't.

790
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:48,590
我到机库时  劳森很焦躁
When I got to the hangar, Lawson was agitated.

791
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,820
她说她还要拯救生命
She said she had lives to save.

792
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:54,630
她想自己开艾西斯
She was trying to take the Asis up herself,

793
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,780
但你说...
but you said that...

794
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:59,370
如果事关人命  那我要来开
If there were lives at stake, I would fly the plane.

795
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:00,420
对
Yeah.

796
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:01,740
对
Yep.

797
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,600
重大的英雄时刻
Big hero moment.

798
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,530
那种我们都一直在等待的时刻
The kind of moment we'd both been waiting for.

799
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,750
博士一向很特别
The doc was always unique.

800
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,740
所以我们喜欢她
That's why we liked her.

801
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,490
但现在你说她是另一个星球来的
But now you're saying she's from another planet.

802
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,650
我知道你肯定很难接受
I know this must be hard for you.

803
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,330
怎么  这部分吗
Oh, what? This part right here?

804
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,860
不  不
No. No.

805
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,780
难的部分是失去我最好的朋友
What's hard is losing my best friend...

806
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:33,420
但这任务太机密
in a mission so secret

807
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,680
他们就假装什么都没发生
they act like it never even happened.

808
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:41,280
难的部分是知道你一直都活在某处
Hard is knowing you were out there somewhere

809
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,150
固执地不肯死去
too damn stubborn to die.

810
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,630
现在时隔六年  你又跑来
And now you come up in here after six years...

811
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:49,700
双手能发射高能
with your supercharged fire hands...

812
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,290
还要我喊你
and you expect me to call you...

813
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:53,400
什么...弗斯吗
I don't even know what. Vers?

814
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,020
你现在真是这个人了吗
Is that really who you are now?

815
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,560
我不知道
I don't know.

816
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,350
来看看
Come look!

817
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:16,230
这是我们在万圣节时
This is me and you on Halloween.

818
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:17,880
我是阿梅莉亚·埃尔哈特
I'm Amelia Earhart

819
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,400
你是詹尼斯·乔普林
and you're Janis Joplin.

820
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:21,150
这是你小时候
This is you when you were little.

821
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:23,000
你跟你父母关系不好
You didn't get along with your parents...

822
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
所以妈妈说  我们成了你真正的家人
so Mom said we became your real family.

823
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,800
这是我们圣诞节的时候
This is us on Christmas.

824
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,180
我收到了我最喜欢的兔子拖鞋
I got my favorite bunny slippers.

825
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:29,620
这也是张你小时候的照片
This is another picture of you when you were little.

826
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:30,600
你一直想当飞行员
You've always wanted to be a pilot.

827
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,690
这是你刚毕业时
And this is right after you graduated.

828
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:33,490
这是你圣诞节时收到的狗狗
This was your dog that you got for Christmas...

829
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:35,090
这是你空军小队的大合照
This is a picture of everybody from your Air Force team.

830
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:37,180
这是你和妈妈在一天训练顺利完成后照的
And this is you with Mom right after a good day of training.

831
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:39,440
他们是三个你最喜欢的人
These were your three favorite guys.

832
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:42,760
等等  我忘了
Wait. I forgot.

833
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,110
你的外套
Your jacket.

834
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,940
我在上面洒了番茄酱
Mom doesn't let me wear it anymore

835
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:47,940
妈妈就不许我穿了
after I spilled ketchup on it.

836
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,960
那是坠机时唯一留下的
That was all that survived the crash.

837
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,110
至少我们以为是
Or so we thought.

838
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,050
别去开门
Don't answer that.

839
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,360
只是我的邻居
It's just my neighbor.

840
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:16,340
他们能变形成任何人
They can change into anyone.

841
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:22,750
你好
Hi there.

842
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:24,520
有什么事
What do you want?

843
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:27,150
汤姆
Tom.

844
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:28,990
这是我朋友  卡罗尔
This is my friend, Carol.

845
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:30,660
认识你很高兴
Pleased to meet you.

846
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:33,430
老天爷
Yowzers.

847
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:36,210
这里的静电可真要命
Static electricity out here's no joke.

848
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:39,270
我注意到你停在路边的那架大鸟
I noticed that peculiar bird you got parked by the road...

849
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:40,360
我只是想问
and I was just wondering...

850
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,140
我能不能带孩子们过来
if you mind if I bring the boys over

851
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,440
仔细看看
to get a closer look-see?

852
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,640
-仔细看看  -是啊
- A closer look-see? - Yeah.

853
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,640
看停在路边的大鸟
To see the "bird" parked out by the road?

854
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:53,070
你装得还真像啊  是吧
You're really working overtime to sell this one, aren't you,

855
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:54,530
塔罗斯
Talos?

856
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,550
抱歉  汤姆  现在真的不太方便
I'm sorry, Tom. This really isn't a good time.

857
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,660
我明天再去找你  好吗
I'll come by tomorrow, okay?

858
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,750
好了
Okay.

859
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:06,800
你该对邻居更客气点的
You know, you really should be kinder to your neighbors.

860
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:10,370
说不定哪天还要去借糖呢
You never know when you're gonna need to borrow some sugar.

861
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:15,830
等一下
Now, hang on a second.

862
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:19,430
先别急着挥你的魔术手
Before you go swinging those jazz hands around...

863
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,430
把你朋友家砸得稀巴烂
making a mess of your friend's house...

864
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:24,280
而且你家很漂亮  女士
It's a lovely home, miss.

865
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,650
天呐
Oh, my God!

866
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,720
怎么回事
What the hell?

867
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,230
没人会伤害她的
No one's gonna hurt the girl.

868
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,750
别杀我
Just don't kill me.

869
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:38,190
那样情况就真的麻烦了
That would really complicate the situation.

870
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:40,740
我再过五秒就要麻烦一墙的
I'm about five seconds from complicating that wall

871
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:42,480
恶心斯库鲁脑浆了
with some ugly-ass Skrull brains.

872
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,030
抱歉我模仿了你的上司
I'm sorry I simmed your boss.

873
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:47,420
但现在  我以真身站在你们面前
But now I stand before you as my true self.

874
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,900
没有欺骗
Without deception.

875
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,390
那外面的是谁
And who is that out there?

876
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,370
好吧  有道理
Okay, that's a fair point...

877
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:55,340
但我相信你能理解
but I'm sure that you understand

878
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:57,540
我必须采取些预防措施
I had to take some precautions.

879
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:01,040
我看到你碾压了我20个最好的手下
I saw you crush 20 of my best men

880
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,470
而且你的手还被困着
with your hands bound.

881
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,510
我只想谈谈
I just wanna talk.

882
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:04,390
上次我们谈时
Last time we talked,

883
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:06,000
我被倒吊了起来
I ended up hanging from my ankles.

884
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,460
那时我还不知道你的身份
That was before I knew who you were.

885
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:11,680
我还不知道你跟其他人的不同之处
Before I knew what made you different from the others.

886
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,360
我有段飞马计划的录音
I have an audio recording from Pegasus...

887
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,030
录的是六年前一场坠机中
of your voice from a plane crash

888
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:19,810
你的声音
six years ago...

889
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:24,120
那个设备好像被你们称为"黑匣子"
on a device I believe you call a "black box."

890
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,890
他们说黑匣子毁于了坠机
They told me it was destroyed in the crash.

891
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,400
你怎么拿到的
How'd you get it?

892
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,520
她不懂
She don't understand.

893
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,340
小姑娘  我有独特的技能  让我可以
Young lady, I have a special skill that kind of allows me to

894
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,700
进入我不该进的地方
get into places I'm not supposed to be.

895
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,000
你再敢喊我"小姑娘"
Call me "young lady" again...

896
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,590
我就一脚踢到我不该踢到的地方
I'm gonna put my foot in a place it's not supposed to be.

897
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,300
难道要我猜那是哪里吗
Am I supposed to guess where that is?

898
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:44,940
你的屁股
Your ass.

899
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,740
好吧  我懂  我们都有点紧张
Okay, I get it. We're all a little on edge here.

900
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,430
但听着  我只需要你帮我
But, look, I just need your help

901
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:51,140
解码一个坐标
decoding some coordinates.

902
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:53,190
如果你坐下  听听录音
If you'll sit down and you'll listen to this...

903
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:56,320
我保证  你不会失望的
I assure you, it'll be worth your while.

904
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,160
把你的朋友叫进来  我就听
Call your buddy back inside and I'll listen.

905
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,080
好
Deal.

906
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:05,650
天呐  把那玩意拿远点
Oh, my God! Get that thing away.

907
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:07,240
它怎么进来的
How'd that get in here?

908
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:10,910
猫吗
The cat?

909
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:12,770
你不会怕这个吧
This isn't what you're afraid of, is it?

910
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:14,180
那不是猫
That's not a cat.

911
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:17,130
-那是噬元兽  -噬元兽
- That's a Flerken. - A Flerken?

912
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:18,990
妈妈
Mom?

913
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:27,180
莫妮卡
Monica.

914
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:28,740
我为什么不能听
Why can't I listen, too?

915
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:57,780
怎么回事
What's happening?

916
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,230
在加载
It's loading.

917
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:04,940
输入坐标
Punch in the coordinates

918
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:09,480
5-2-2-9, negative 4-7, 8.7-6-8, 0.2.

919
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,840
收到  我们去哪  博士
Copy that. Where are we going, Doc?

920
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:13,190
我的实验室
My laboratory.

921
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,420
你的实验室  什么意思
Your laboratory? What do you mean?

922
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,810
不
Oh, no.

923
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:19,020
那是  等等  那是什么
Is that... Wait, what is that?

924
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:20,650
我的雷达上没有显示
It's not showing up on my radar.

925
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:22,300
快走  卡罗尔  快飞
Go, Carol. Fly!

926
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:25,050
那可不是米格  劳森  他们是什么人
That's no MiG, Lawson. Who the hell are they?

927
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:27,430
那是坏人  飞快点
Those are the bad guys. Fly faster now!

928
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:28,490
是  长官
Yes, ma'am.

929
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:36,730
-他们想要什么  -我  我的研究
- What do they want? - Me. My work.

930
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:38,340
我就不该带你来
I never should have brought you along.

931
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:44,820
要难受了
Here come some G's.

932
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:05,480
他们在向后开火  撑住
They're firing backwards. Hold on!

933
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:18,340
跳伞  跳伞
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

934
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:23,660
撑住  劳森
Stay with me, Lawson!

935
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,190
卡罗尔  回复  你收到吗
Carol, come in. Do you copy?

936
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:45,690
我收到  我们坠机了
Yeah, I copy. We hit ground.

937
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:47,350
卡罗尔  你没事吧  你收到吗
Carol, are you okay? Do you copy?

938
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:49,030
我收到
Yeah! I copy.

939
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:53,170
博士
Doc?

940
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,360
你的血
Your blood.

941
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:58,090
是蓝的
It's blue.

942
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:01,540
是啊  但我的发型没事吧
Yeah, but, uh, how's my hair?

943
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,800
帮帮我  好吗
Help me out, will ya?

944
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:10,770
我得在他们赶到前毁掉它
I gotta destroy it before they get here.

945
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:12,780
劳森
Lawson?

946
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,300
记得我怎么说我们的工作的吗
You remember what I said about our work here?

947
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:16,810
目的是什么
What it's for?

948
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,330
结束战争
To end wars?

949
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:22,540
对  但战争的规模比你想的要大
Yeah. But the wars are bigger than you know.

950
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:25,120
该死
Damn it!

951
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,490
我不叫劳森
My name is not Lawson.

952
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:31,070
我的真名是玛威尔
My real name is Mar-Vell,

953
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:34,300
我来自哈拉星球
and I come from a planet called Hala.

954
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,980
我想说你是脑袋糊涂了
I would say that you're delusional... but

955
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,530
但我们刚被太空飞船打下来
we just got shot down by a spaceship

956
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:41,210
你的血又是蓝的
and your blood is blue.

957
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:45,850
听着  我半辈子都在打一场可耻的战争
Listen, I spent half my life fighting a shameful war.

958
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:49,200
你快走吧  别让我更加懊悔了
Now, skedaddle before you give me any more regrets.

959
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,580
记住那坐标  好吗
Just remember the coordinates, okay?

960
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,930
你得单独救他们了
You gotta save 'em without me.

961
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,160
救谁  怎么救
Save who? How?

962
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:58,400
我得在他们找到前炸毁引擎
Now I gotta blow this engine before they find it.

963
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,560
你干什么
What are you doing?

964
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,840
我们无意伤害你
We have no interest in hurting you.

965
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:22,880
是吗
No?

966
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,090
因为你们猛烈的火力让我不那么觉得
'Cause all the shooting kinda gave me the wrong impression!

967
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,030
能量核
The energy core.

968
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:30,970
在哪
Where is it?

969
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,850
伞兵救援很快就到
Pararescue's on the way.

970
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:36,180
还有两分钟  你就会被包围
You have two minutes until you're surrounded.

971
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,650
那就没必要继续跟你废话了
Then I see no reason to prolong this conversation.

972
01:09:38,650 --> 01:09:39,680
不  等等
No, wait!

973
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,860
你是问那个能量核吗
You mean that energy core?

974
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:53,420
不
No!

975
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:40,640
指挥官  她还在动  可以开火吗
Commander? She's still moving. Permission to fire.

976
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:41,830
别开火
Hold your fire.

977
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,860
什么都不剩了
There's nothing left.

978
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,190
核被摧毁了
The core has been destroyed.

979
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:06,680
她吸收了核的能量
She absorbed its power.

980
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,520
她要跟我们走
She's coming with us.

981
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:32,920
他骗了我
He lied to me.

982
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:37,770
我所知的一切都是谎言
Everything that I knew was a lie.

983
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:40,540
现在你明白了
Now, you understand.

984
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:43,140
什么  我明白什么了
What? What do I understand now?

985
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:45,170
勇·罗格杀了玛威尔
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

986
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:46,340
他杀了她
He killed her...

987
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:48,310
因为她发现
'cause she found out that

988
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:52,720
自己站在战争中不正义的一方
she was on the wrong side of an unjust war.

989
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,750
不
No.

990
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:56,230
斯库鲁人都是恐怖分子
Your people are terrorists.

991
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:57,860
他们杀无辜者
They kill innocents.

992
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,530
我看到托法上的废墟了
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

993
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:02,690
那是指控者干的
Ruins that the Accusers are responsible for.

994
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:07,430
我们是作为难民在托法上生活
My people lived as refugees on Torfa.

995
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:10,660
无家可归  就因为我们反对克里统治
Homeless, ever since we resisted Kree rule...

996
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,900
被他们摧毁了家园
and they destroyed our planet.

997
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:15,440
我们仅剩的不多的人
And the handful of us that are left

998
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:18,720
也会遭到屠戮
will be slaughtered next...

999
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:22,680
除非你帮我完成玛威尔的目标
unless you help me finish what Mar-Vell started.

1000
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:25,370
她发现的核
The core that she found

1001
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:27,110
能驱动光速飞船
would have powered a light-speed ship...

1002
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:29,120
可以带我们前往安全之处
capable of carrying us to safety.

1003
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:33,180
前往克里人找不到的新家园
A new home where the Kree can't reach us.

1004
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:37,030
劳森总说我们飞马计划的工作
Lawson always told us that our work at Pegasus

1005
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,630
不是为了作战
wasn't to fight wars...

1006
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,940
是为了结束战争
but to end them.

1007
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:45,390
她希望你帮我们找到能量核
She wanted you to help us find the core.

1008
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:47,950
我已经摧毁了它
Well, I already destroyed it.

1009
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:49,660
不  你毁掉了引擎
No, you destroyed the engine.

1010
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:52,560
但驱动它的能量核在其他地方
The core that powered it is in a remote location.

1011
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:56,370
如果你能帮我们解码坐标
If you help us decode those coordinates...

1012
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:58,620
我们就能找到它
we can find it.

1013
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:02,650
你会用它对付我们的
You'll use it to destroy us.

1014
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:07,410
我们只想要个家
We just want a home.

1015
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:17,020
你和我都因克里人失去了一切
You and I lost everything at the hands of the Kree.

1016
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:18,880
你还不明白吗
Can't you see it now?

1017
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:20,940
你不是他们的人
You're not one of them.

1018
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:24,940
你不了解我
You don't know me.

1019
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:28,930
你不知道我是谁
You have no idea who I am.

1020
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:33,090
我都不知道我是谁   永久域名CCTV12306.COM
I don't even know who I am!

1021
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:36,840
你是卡罗尔·丹弗斯
You are Carol Danvers.

1022
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:39,900
你是那个黑匣子上录下的女人
You are the woman on that black box

1023
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:42,870
为了做正确的事不惜冒生命危险
risking her life to do the right thing.

1024
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,190
我最好的朋友
My best friend...

1025
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,480
在我没有其他人时  支持我这个单亲妈妈
who supported me as a mother and a pilot

1026
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,020
和飞行员
when no one else did.

1027
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:56,030
你聪明  幽默  非常烦人
You are smart, and funny, and a huge pain in the ass...

1028
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,940
你是我认识的最强大的人
and you were the most powerful person I knew...

1029
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,920
哪怕是你还不会用手开火的时候
way before you could shoot fire from your fists.

1030
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,270
你听到了吗
You hear me?

1031
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,330
你听到了吗
Do you hear me?

1032
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:18,040
过来  过来  姑娘
Come here. Come here, girl.

1033
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:20,040
有我呢
I got you.

1034
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:27,110
我知道我不配让你信任我
I know I don't deserve your trust...

1035
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:29,850
但你是我们唯一的线索
but you were our only lead.

1036
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:32,470
我们发现你的能量信号
We discovered that your energy signature

1037
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:34,880
与玛威尔的能量核一致
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1038
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:37,380
现在我们知道原因了
Now we know why.

1039
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:43,750
如果你知道它对我是多么重要
If only you knew the importance of it to me.

1040
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,320
我就需要你帮我
I just need your help

1041
01:14:46,410 --> 01:14:50,160
破解玛威尔实验室的坐标
decoding the coordinates to Mar-Vell's lab.

1042
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:53,970
那不是坐标  是状态向量
Those weren't coordinates. They're state vectors.

1043
01:14:53,970 --> 01:14:55,930
环绕位置和速度的
For orbital position and velocity.

1044
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:57,650
你在地球上找不到她的实验室
You didn't find her lab on Earth,

1045
01:14:57,650 --> 01:14:59,080
因为它不在地球上
'cause it's not on Earth.

1046
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:01,660
那是六年前坠机日时的地点
That was the location on the date of the crash six years ago.

1047
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:02,820
只要追踪其轨迹
If we track its course,

1048
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:05,470
马上就能在环绕轨道上找到它
we'll find it in orbit right now.

1049
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:07,160
只是基本物理
It's just basic physics.

1050
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,110
轨道环绕
In orbit?

1051
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:14,500
就那么难破解吗
Was that so difficult to figure out?

1052
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,810
你可是我的科技人员
I mean, you're my science guy, right?

1053
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:19,360
勇·罗格很快就会找到我
Yon-Rogg will catch up to me soon.

1054
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,430
我们得在他之前找到能量核
We've got to get to the core before he does.

1055
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:23,860
我们上太空吗
We're going to space?

1056
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:25,530
乘什么去
In what?

1057
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:27,640
稍稍调整下你的飞机应该就行
A few tweaks to your vessel should do it.

1058
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,940
我可以负责改装
I can handle the modifications.

1059
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:31,340
你的科技人员
Your science guy.

1060
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:40,140
我需要个副驾
Well, I could use a copilot.

1061
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:44,200
不  我不能
No. No, I can't.

1062
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,470
我不能丢下莫妮卡
I can't leave Monica.

1063
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:49,040
妈妈  没事  我可以去外婆外公家住
Mom, it's okay. I can stay with Gramma and Paw-paw.

1064
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:51,550
我不能去  宝贝  太危险了
There's no way I'm going, baby. It's too dangerous.

1065
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:53,660
测试新航空科技还危险呢
Testing brand-new aerospace tech is dangerous...

1066
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:55,120
你以前不也做那个吗
and you used to do that.

1067
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,280
你的计划是乘坐一架
Your plan is to leave the atmosphere

1068
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,190
原本不能离开大气的飞机离开大气
in a craft not designed for the journey...

1069
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:01,830
而且还可能遭遇
and you anticipate hostile encounters

1070
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:04,400
科技更先进的外星敌人
with a technologically-superior foreign enemy.

1071
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,440
是吗
Correct?

1072
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,960
所以我说啊
That's what I'm saying.

1073
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,120
-你必须去  -莫妮卡
- You have to go! - Monica!

1074
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,590
你有机会去执行任务史上
You have a chance to fly the coolest mission

1075
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:10,910
最酷的任务
in the history of missions...

1076
01:16:10,910 --> 01:16:12,510
你要放弃这机会  坐在沙发上
and you're gonna give it up to sit on the couch

1077
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:14,280
跟我一起看《新鲜王子》吗
and watch Fresh Prince with me?

1078
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:15,450
什么
What?

1079
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:17,020
我觉得你该好好想想
I just think you should consider

1080
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:19,800
你在给你的女儿立下什么样的榜样
what kind of example you're setting for your daughter.

1081
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,160
这是怎么回事
What's going on around here?

1082
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:29,870
我知道
I know, I know.

1083
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,520
我去里面解释  谢谢你们
I'll explain inside. Thank you.

1084
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:38,750
你妈妈很幸运
Your mom's lucky.

1085
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:40,580
天上发孩子时
When they were handing out kids,

1086
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:42,390
给了她最坚强的一个
they gave her the toughest one.

1087
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:44,500
捣蛋中尉
Lieutenant Trouble.

1088
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,520
你记得了
You remembered.

1089
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:49,160
那是我的吗
Is that mine?

1090
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:51,420
不
No, no.

1091
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:54,450
你留着吧  等我回来再说
You hang on to it until I come back.

1092
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:58,020
但有件事我需要你帮忙
But there is something that I need your help with.

1093
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:00,330
我不能再穿克里人的颜色了
I can't wear these Kree colors anymore.

1094
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:03,720
而因为你显然是这里唯一
And since you are obviously the only person around here

1095
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,340
有时尚感的人
with any sense of style...

1096
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,070
不行
No.

1097
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:21,610
绝对不行
Definitely not.

1098
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,660
既然我们是一队的
Well, since we're on the same team...

1099
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:41,860
我看上去如何
How do I look?

1100
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:46,730
靓丽
Fresh.

1101
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:08,130
你怎么才来
What took you so long?

1102
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,260
我很好  多谢关心
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

1103
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,080
-PRY46B  -不  不说密码了
- PRY46-B... - No, no codes.

1104
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,230
这系统不可靠了  我们都知道了
That system is fallible, as we've learned.

1105
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,770
好吧  那我们开始吧
Okay, then let's do this.

1106
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:22,760
我与至高智慧密谈时  看到的是谁
Who do I see when I commune with the Supreme Intelligence?

1107
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:25,770
你最崇拜尊敬的人吧
The person you most admire and respect, I'd guess.

1108
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,410
但你绝不会告诉我是谁的
But you would never tell me who.

1109
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,640
你对哈拉最早的记忆是什么
And what is your earliest memory of Hala?

1110
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,910
输血
The transfusion.

1111
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:35,280
蓝血流过我的血管
Blue blood running through my veins.

1112
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:36,790
谁的血
Whose blood?

1113
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,490
流过她血管的是我的血
That's my blood that's coursing through her veins.

1114
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,970
你把她怎么了
What have you done with her?

1115
01:18:57,970 --> 01:18:59,210
你太迟了
You're too late.

1116
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:17,790
她知道了
She knows?

1117
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,810
罗南  斯库鲁人已潜入了C53
Ronan, Skrulls have infiltrated C-53.

1118
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:36,760

01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:39,020
为了全体克里人  指挥官
For the good of all Kree, Commander,

1120
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:41,670
入侵者会被根除的
the infestation will be eradicated.

1121
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:46,310
高度500  还在攀升
Passing 500 and climbing.

1122
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,490
你真的不该把那玩意放腿上
You know, you really shouldn't have that thing on your lap.

1123
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:56,010
我们跟你的联盟没那么可靠
Our little alliance with you is tenuous at best.

1124
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:58,900
只要它还能吓到你
And as long as he continues to freak you out...

1125
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,090
就像这样
like that...

1126
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:02,090
嗯  我就要继续
yeah, I'm gonna keep giving him

1127
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:05,620
爱它抱它  让它满意
all the loves and hugs that he needs, right?

1128
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:07,270
我能问你件事吗
Can I ask you something?

1129
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:09,320
你可以想变成什么变成什么
Do you just turn into anything you want?

1130
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:11,180
我得先看到
Well, I have to see it first.

1131
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:12,700
你们都能吗
Can you all do it?

1132
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:14,620
从生理学上讲  是的
Physiologically? Yeah.

1133
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:16,880
但这是需要练习的
But, uh, it takes practice...

1134
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,980
不瞒你说  还需要天赋  才能做好
and, um, dare I say it, talent to do it well.

1135
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:23,460
-你能变成猫吗  -猫是什么
- Can you turn into a cat? - What's a cat?

1136
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:25,120
那文件柜呢
What about a filing cabinet?

1137
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:28,510
我为什么要变成文件柜
Why would I turn into a filing cabinet?

1138
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:29,410
捕蝇草呢
A Venus flytrap?

1139
01:20:29,410 --> 01:20:30,630
如果你能变成捕蝇草
I'll give you 50 bucks right now

1140
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:32,350
我这就给你50块
if you turn into a Venus flytrap.

1141
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:35,320
超音速燃烧冲压式喷气引擎切换至核聚变引擎
Switching engines from Scramjet to Fusion.

1142
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,760
坐稳了  各位
Buckle up, folks.

1143
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:49,350
这正常吗  是太空紊流吗
Is this normal, like, space turbulence?

1144
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:50,490
差不多吧
Pretty much.

1145
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,900
锁定坐标网格
Locking in on coordinate grid.

1146
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:27,980
它在哪呢
Where is it?

1147
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,590
就在这里  肯定在这里
It's here. It's gotta be here.

1148
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:39,420
那是在空空荡荡前面还是后面
Well, is it in front of all that nothing, or behind it?

1149
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:46,940
去隐形启动
Decloaking activated.

1150
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,830
就是那个吗  能量核
Is that it? The core?

1151
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:54,040
在她的笔记里  她称之为宇宙魔方
In her notes she called it the Tesseract.

1152
01:23:02,790 --> 01:23:05,520
劳森怎么会有这么多孩子玩具
What was Lawson doing with all this kid stuff?

1153
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:20,120
这里有别人
We're not alone.

1154
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:44,110
塔罗斯
Talos!

1155
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:56,780
他不是来找宇宙魔方的
He didn't come here for the Tesseract.

1156
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:20,980
没事
It's okay.

1157
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:27,800
我们不知道该怎么办
We didn't know what to do.

1158
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:30,870
玛威尔警告我们无论如何都不能发信号
Mar-Vell warned us not to send a signal for any reason...

1159
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,020
否则会被克里人找到
or the Kree would find us.

1160
01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:34,590
你做得对
You did the right thing.

1161
01:24:44,810 --> 01:24:46,150
没事
It's okay, it's okay.

1162
01:24:46,850 --> 01:24:48,760
她没事  她是个朋友
She's all right. She's a friend.

1163
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:52,420
我不会伤害你们的
I am not gonna hurt you.

1164
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,200
是她让我找到你们的
She led me to you.

1165
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,630
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1166
01:24:58,540 --> 01:24:59,810
我之前不知道
I didn't know.

1167
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:01,120
卡罗尔
Carol.

1168
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:03,460
这是战争
This is war.

1169
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:07,060
我手上也沾满了鲜血
My hands are filthy from it, too.

1170
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,150
但我们走到了这一步
But we're here now.

1171
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,940
你找到了我的家人
You found my family.

1172
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:18,890
这只是个开始
This is just the beginning.

1173
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:22,130
我们还有数千人  散落在银河系各处
There are thousands of us separated from each other...

1174
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:25,620
彼此分离
scattered throughout the galaxy.

1175
01:25:43,550 --> 01:25:45,960
如果我同一台弹球机玩六年
If I played the same pinball machine for six years...

1176
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:47,760
也能打出很高的分
I'd have some high scores, too.

1177
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:52,690
亲近敌人
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1178
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:08,340
你把你的制服怎么了
What did you do to your uniform?

1179
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:10,530
他们控制了她的心智  就像我们猜的那样
They got in her head. Just like we thought.

1180
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:12,170
至高智慧能恢复她的心智
The Supreme Intelligence will set her straight.

1181
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:14,110
你看得到他们不是战士
You can see they're not soldiers.

1182
01:26:14,110 --> 01:26:16,140
放了他们吧  把我抓走
Let 'em go. You can have me.

1183
01:26:16,150 --> 01:26:17,370
能量核呢
And the core?

1184
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:19,500
你骗了我
You lied to me.

1185
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:23,170
我让你成了最好的自己
I made you the best version of yourself.

1186
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:29,920
赐予你的也能收回
What's given can be taken away.

1187
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:44,450
过去  快走
Back here! Move, move!

1188
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:46,490
过去  趴下
Get over here. Get down!

1189
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:49,910
快走  走
Let's go! Go, move!

1190
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:31,440
她来了
There she is.

1191
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:34,740
看来你在C53上的经历让你想起了曾经
Seems like your time on C-53 jogged the old memory.

1192
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:37,170
这件外套
This jacket.

1193
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,820
真是帅爆了
It's killer, by the way.

1194
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:44,870
音乐  真不错
The music. It's a nice touch.

1195
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:46,840
放我走
Let me out.

1196
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,180
不行
No can do.

1197
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:52,260
如果你伤害他们  我就把你烧毁
If you hurt them, I will burn you to the ground.

1198
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:53,910
用什么呢
With what exactly?

1199
01:27:54,510 --> 01:27:55,790
你的能力来自我们
Your power comes from us.

1200
01:27:55,790 --> 01:27:58,110
这能力不是你们给的
You didn't give me these powers.

1201
01:27:58,110 --> 01:27:58,970
是那场爆炸
The blast did.

1202
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:00,410
但你一直都不够强大
And yet, you've never had the strength

1203
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:02,000
不能自己控制好
to control them on your own.

1204
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:14,490
物种  噬元兽
Species: Flerken.

1205
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:15,870
威胁程度  高
Threat: high.

1206
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,260
它是只猫  不是汉尼拔·莱克特
It's a cat, not Hannibal Lecter.

1207
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,940
物种  人类男性
Species: human male.

1208
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:31,000
威胁程度  几乎为零
Threat: low to none.

1209
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:33,710
那玩意显然是坏了
That thing's clearly busted.

1210
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:35,410
把噬元兽装上氦核飞船
Load the Flerken onto the Helion.

1211
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,250
把其他的丢进太空
Eject the others into space.

1212
01:28:41,610 --> 01:28:43,270
你做得很棒  王牌
You did good, Ace.

1213
01:28:45,090 --> 01:28:45,840
因为你
Thanks to you...

1214
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,020
那些险恶的变形人
those insidious shapeshifters

1215
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:50,070
再不能威胁我们的边境了
will threaten our borders no more.

1216
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:52,040
我以前相信过你的谎言
I used to believe your lies...

1217
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,530
但斯库鲁人只是在为建立家园而战
but the Skrulls are just fighting for a home.

1218
01:28:55,150 --> 01:28:56,640
你想摧毁他们
You're talking about destroying them

1219
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,690
就因为他们不肯屈从你的规矩
because they won't submit to your rule.

1220
01:28:58,690 --> 01:28:59,930
我也不会屈服的
And neither will I.

1221
01:28:59,930 --> 01:29:02,920
是我们发现了你  我们把你接纳为我们的一员
We found you. We embraced you as our own.

1222
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,120
你们绑架了我
You stole me.

1223
01:29:04,670 --> 01:29:07,920
让我远离家乡  家人  朋友
From my home, my family, my friends.

1224
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:17,840
你的努力真是可爱
It's cute how hard you try.

1225
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:21,070
但记住
But remember...

1226
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:24,030
没有我们
without us...

1227
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:25,480
放弃吧  卡罗尔
Give it up, Carol.

1228
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:27,660
别起来了
Stay down!

1229
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:29,150
你是弱小的
...you're weak.

1230
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:31,690
你开太快了  你得慢点
You're going too fast! You need to go slow!

1231
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:32,540
你是不完美的
You're flawed.

1232
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:34,430
你是想害死自己吗
Are you trying to kill yourself?

1233
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:35,970
无助的
Helpless.

1234
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:37,830
你太情绪化  好弱
You're too emotional and so weak.

1235
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:39,470
你不该来这里
You don't belong out here!

1236
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,370
是我们救了你
We saved you.

1237
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,170
-控制住  -我说了  卡罗尔
- Control it. - I told you, Carol.

1238
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:44,360
他们绝不会让你飞的
They'll never let you fly.

1239
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:45,480
这不是小姑娘的游戏
This ain't a game for little girls.

1240
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,570
你吻技好生硬
You kiss like a horse.

1241
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:48,580
你一周都坚持不住  丹弗斯
You won't last a week, Danvers.

1242
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:53,650
没有我们  你只是人类
Without us, you're only human.

1243
01:29:55,410 --> 01:29:56,430
你说对了
You're right.

1244
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,290
我只是人类
I'm only human.

1245
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:37,130
在哈拉上  你重生了  成为了
On Hala, you were reborn...

1246
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:38,700
弗斯
Vers.

1247
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,800
我叫卡罗尔
My name is Carol.

1248
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:03,250
她想挣脱出来
She's trying to break out.

1249
01:31:47,470 --> 01:31:50,560
我一直绑着一只手作战
I've been fighting with one arm tied behind my back.

1250
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:53,320
但如果我
But what happens when...

1251
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,110
终于挣脱开会怎样
I'm finally set free?

1252
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:41,750
你知道你在发光吧
You know you're glowing, right?

1253
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:43,030
回头解释
I'll explain it later.

1254
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:46,780
拿走宇宙魔方
Take the Tesseract.

1255
01:32:46,850 --> 01:32:48,130
留下午餐盒
Leave the lunchbox.

1256
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:49,640
-我吗  -对
- Me? - Yes.

1257
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:51,210
我可不碰那玩意
I'm not touching that thing.

1258
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:52,870
要我给你找副防热手套吗
You want me to get you an oven mitt?

1259
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:07,860
带斯库鲁人上夸式战斗机飞走
Get the Skrulls on the Quadjet and go.

1260
01:33:08,790 --> 01:33:10,750
带上噬元兽
Take the Flerken with you.

1261
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,430
-那你呢  -我给你们争取时间
- What about you? - I'll buy you some time!

1262
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,990
我要把你抱起来了
I'm picking you up now.

1263
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:22,730
我相信你不会吃了我
I'm trusting you not to eat me.

1264
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:29,300
你们好啊
Guys.

1265
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:34,530
为宇宙魔方掰腕子啊
Arm wrestle for the Tesseract?

1266
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,330
我以前还觉得你挺逗
I used to find you amusing.

1267
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:41,620
我们做个了结吧
Let's put an end to this.

1268
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:17,650
好吧
Okay.

1269
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,020
乖喵喵
Good kitty.

1270
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:07,160
你一直都知道
You knew all along.

1271
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:09,830
所以我们才从不一起玩吗
Is that why we never hung out?

1272
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:11,320
不  我就是不喜欢你
No, I just never liked you.

1273
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:20,240
来啦
Incoming!

1274
01:35:28,030 --> 01:35:29,070
着什么急
In a hurry?

1275
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:32,350
别逼我这么做
Don't make me do this.

1276
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:33,930
那好
Okay.

1277
01:35:49,770 --> 01:35:51,120
快点  吃了他们
Come on, do your thing!

1278
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:53,280
来啊
Come on!

1279
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:56,790
来啊
Come on!

1280
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,110
真是的  咕咕
Damn it, Goose.

1281
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:02,810
选好边吧
Pick a side.

1282
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:08,370
把他们也带去机库
Take them to the hangar, too.

1283
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:10,540
我们把他们都丢进太空
We'll blast them all into space.

1284
01:36:12,930 --> 01:36:14,000
别激动
Play it cool.

1285
01:36:15,430 --> 01:36:16,720
就像在哈瓦那时那样
Just like Havana.

1286
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:19,700
你拿到那东西了吗
Do you have the thing?

1287
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:22,180
被噬元兽猫吃了
Flerken kitty ate it.

1288
01:36:35,770 --> 01:36:36,850
快走
Come on, move!

1289
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:38,010
快走
Move!

1290
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:40,020
看我的行事
Follow my lead.

1291
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:45,650
遮住她的眼睛
Cover her eyes.

1292
01:36:54,230 --> 01:36:55,310
上船
Onto the ship!

1293
01:36:55,450 --> 01:36:56,710
快走  快走
Let's go! Let's go!

1294
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:21,960
好个移花接木
Nice diversion.

1295
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:24,260
我真以为我放进去了
I could have swore I put it in there.

1296
01:38:21,250 --> 01:38:23,470
米涅瓦  开战机击落他们
Minn-Erva, take them down in the drop ship.

1297
01:38:23,470 --> 01:38:24,530
好的
On it.

1298
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:30,430
你没事吧  朋友
You all right, friend?

1299
01:38:31,210 --> 01:38:33,310
好极了
Never better.

1300
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:39,980
有敌机追来了
We got a bogey coming in hot.

1301
01:40:19,510 --> 01:40:20,670
好啊
Yes!

1302
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:43,240
那是什么鬼
What the hell was that?

1303
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,770
发射弹道导弹弹头
Deploy ballistic warheads.

1304
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,370
这不可能
That's impossible.

1305
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,880
C53没有能摧毁我们弹头的
C-53 doesn't have a defense system

1306
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,640
足够先进的防御系统
advanced enough to destroy our warheads.

1307
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:11,640
那不是他们的防御系统  罗南
That's not their defense system, Ronan.

1308
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:17,230
干掉她
Take her down.

1309
01:43:27,830 --> 01:43:29,520
回跳跃点
Return to the jump point.

1310
01:43:30,790 --> 01:43:32,640
我们改日再回来带走武器
We'll be back for the weapon.

1311
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:35,490
能量核吗
The core?

1312
01:43:37,490 --> 01:43:38,530
是她
The woman.

1313
01:44:26,830 --> 01:44:28,230
我真为你骄傲
I'm so proud of you.

1314
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:31,540
自那天
You've come a long way

1315
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:33,930
我在湖边发现你  你进步了好多
since I found you that day by the lake.

1316
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:36,270
但你能克制住你的情绪
But can you keep your emotions in check

1317
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:38,080
直到打败我吗
long enough to take me on?

1318
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,310
还是你仍会如以往那样被情绪左右
Or will they get the better of you as always?

1319
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:44,590
我一直对你说
I always told you...

1320
01:44:44,910 --> 01:44:45,930
等你可以
you'll be ready

1321
01:44:45,930 --> 01:44:48,820
凭自身实力打倒我  你就真准备好了
the day you can knock me down as yourself.

1322
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:50,500
这一刻终于来了
This is that moment.

1323
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:52,900
这就是见分晓的时刻  弗斯
This is that moment, Vers!

1324
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:54,660
停下那些花里胡哨的
Turn off the light show...

1325
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:58,330
向我证明  你可以光明正大地打败我...
and prove to me you can beat me without...

1326
01:45:13,310 --> 01:45:15,230
我不用向你证明什么
I have nothing to prove to you.

1327
01:45:31,150 --> 01:45:33,030
目的地  哈拉
Destination: Hala.

1328
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,060
我不能空手而归
I can't go back empty-handed.

1329
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:36,620
你不会空手而归
You won't be empty-handed.

1330
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:38,650
我会让你带句话回去
I'm sending you with a message.

1331
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:42,200
告诉至高智慧  我会去终结一切
Tell the Supreme Intelligence that I'm coming to end it.

1332
01:45:42,730 --> 01:45:46,230
战争  谎言  所有一切
The war. The lies. All of it.

1333
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:48,950
你不能那么做
You can't do this.

1334
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:10,600
真悬啊  是吧  咕咕
That was a close call, huh, Goosey?

1335
01:46:12,490 --> 01:46:14,490
那些坏蛋还在你里面吗
Those bad guys still in there somewhere?

1336
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:16,690
我的噬元兽啊
Mother Flerken!

1337
01:46:16,690 --> 01:46:18,020
-你没事吧  -嗯
- You okay? - Yeah.

1338
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:19,540
就是抓了一下而已
It's just a scratch.

1339
01:46:19,950 --> 01:46:21,330
不
No.

1340
01:46:29,610 --> 01:46:32,280
真不敢相信你卷入了一场最酷的肉搏战
I can't believe you got in the raddest dogfight ever...

1341
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:33,300
而我没看到
and I missed it.

1342
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:35,150
要我说  你到的正是时候
I'd say you arrived just in time.

1343
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:37,430
你飞得真的很漂亮
Some nifty flying you did out there.

1344
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:39,750
神盾局总是需要你这样的好飞行员
S.H.I.E.L.D. could always use a good pilot like you.

1345
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:41,260
我会考虑的
I'll consider it...

1346
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:44,430
只要你不再说我的飞行"漂亮"
as long as you never call my flying "nifty" again.

1347
01:46:44,990 --> 01:46:46,150
你的眼睛怎么样了
How's your eye?

1348
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:48,120
每秒都在愈合
Getting better every second.

1349
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:49,570
我想问清楚
Just so I'm clear...

1350
01:46:49,910 --> 01:46:51,290
索拉
you were Soh-Larr...

1351
01:46:51,290 --> 01:46:53,790
-和那个神盾特工都是你  -凯勒
- and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent? - Keller.

1352
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:56,480
他把我上司绑了起来  盗用了他的身份
He tied my boss up, stole his identity.

1353
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:59,490
我只是借了他的脸  我不是贼
I borrowed his likeness. I'm no thief.

1354
01:46:59,490 --> 01:47:00,980
是有点像盗窃
It is a little like stealing.

1355
01:47:01,130 --> 01:47:02,580
你是谁那边的
Whose side are you on here?

1356
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:04,300
你康复前都可以在这里养伤
You're good to go here until you recover...

1357
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:07,340
但你和你家人得换副新模样
but you and your family are gonna need a new look.

1358
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:09,350
我可以继续做你上司
I could go back to being your boss.

1359
01:47:09,550 --> 01:47:10,240
千万别
Please don't.

1360
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:13,300
怎么了  我喜欢他那双漂亮的蓝眼睛
Come on. I loved sporting his beautiful blue eyes.

1361
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:15,740
说什么呢  你们的眼睛最漂亮了
No way. You guys have the best eyes.

1362
01:47:15,970 --> 01:47:18,020
-永远别变你的眼睛  -她的眼睛是很美
- Don't ever change your eyes. - She has beautiful eyes.

1363
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:18,950
多谢你了
That's very sweet of you.

1364
01:47:18,950 --> 01:47:20,960
我想努力不慌乱
I was trying not to panic...

1365
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:22,850
我会帮你们找到家的
I'll help you find a home.

1366
01:47:23,860 --> 01:47:25,610
完成玛威尔的心愿
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

1367
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:29,300
他们可以跟我们住这儿
They can stay here with us.

1368
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:30,460
不是吗  妈妈
Can't they, Mom?

1369
01:47:31,090 --> 01:47:32,900
他们在这里不安全的  宝贝
They won't be safe here, baby.

1370
01:47:33,670 --> 01:47:35,080
卡罗尔阿姨是对的
Auntie Carol's right.

1371
01:47:35,630 --> 01:47:36,920
他们得有自己的家
They need their own home.

1372
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:39,410
我很快就会回来
I'll be back before you know it.

1373
01:47:40,350 --> 01:47:43,010
或许我可以飞上天  跟你碰头
Or maybe I could fly up and meet you halfway?

1374
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:45,830
那你得学会像卡罗尔阿姨那样发光
Only if you learn to glow like your Auntie Carol.

1375
01:47:45,830 --> 01:47:47,680
或许我可以建艘飞船
Or maybe I'll build a spaceship.

1376
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,760
-你又说不准  -是啊
- You don't know. - He doesn't.

1377
01:47:59,190 --> 01:48:01,490
把宇宙魔方留在地球上
Keep the Tesseract on Earth.

1378
01:48:02,290 --> 01:48:03,240
藏好
Hidden.

1379
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:05,490
你确定那是马威会想要的吗
You sure that's what Marvel would want?

1380
01:48:06,190 --> 01:48:07,440
是玛威尔
Mar-Vell.

1381
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:08,810
我就那么说的
That's what I said.

1382
01:48:08,860 --> 01:48:11,440
是两个词  玛  威尔
It's two words. Mar. Vell.

1383
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:12,760
玛威尔
Mar-Vell.

1384
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:13,990
"马威"听上去好多了
"Marvel" sounds a lot better.

1385
01:48:13,990 --> 01:48:15,700
就像惊艳合唱团
You know, like the Marvelettes.

1386
01:48:29,330 --> 01:48:30,550
没印象吗
Not ringing any bells?

1387
01:48:30,550 --> 01:48:32,450
继续唱  或许我会想起来
Keep singing. Maybe it'll come back to me.

1388
01:48:47,780 --> 01:48:49,250
我给它升级了
I upgraded it.

1389
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:52,750
信号范围能至少覆盖几个星系了
Range should be a couple galaxies, at least.

1390
01:48:55,180 --> 01:48:57,450
怎么  你觉得我会给你打骚扰电话吗
What? You think I'm gonna crank call you?

1391
01:48:57,450 --> 01:49:00,620
仅限紧急情况
For emergencies only, okay?

1392
01:49:07,030 --> 01:49:08,080
好吧
Well...

1393
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,780
如果你再路过这个星系
if you're ever passing back through this galaxy...

1394
01:49:10,850 --> 01:49:12,580
务必喊我一声
be sure to give a brother a shout.

1395
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:31,360
我们洗干净了番茄酱的污迹
We got the ketchup stain off.

1396
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,660
谢谢  捣蛋中尉
Thanks, Lieutenant Trouble.

1397
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:50,010
我也不愿意道别
It's hard for me to say goodbye, too.

1398
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:05,440
去吧
Go on.

1399
01:51:12,690 --> 01:51:14,080
很高兴你回来了  长官
Glad to have you back, sir.

1400
01:51:14,570 --> 01:51:15,670
这是寄给您的
This came for you.

1401
01:51:20,250 --> 01:51:21,470
是真的吗
So, is it true?

1402
01:51:22,420 --> 01:51:23,890
克里人烧毁了你的眼睛
That the Kree burned your eye out...

1403
01:51:23,890 --> 01:51:26,170
因为你不肯交出宇宙魔方
because you refused to give them the Tesseract?

1404
01:51:27,270 --> 01:51:31,320
我既不能承认也不能否认这种说法
I will neither confirm nor deny the facts of that story.

1405
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:32,400
明白
Understood.

1406
01:51:33,910 --> 01:51:34,650
很遗憾
I'm sorry to report

1407
01:51:34,660 --> 01:51:36,210
我们仍尚未找到宇宙魔方
that we still haven't found the Tesseract.

1408
01:51:36,210 --> 01:51:38,150
它肯定会出现的
I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.

1409
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:41,460
等出现了我会通知您的
I'll let you know when it does.

1410
01:51:41,810 --> 01:51:42,900
然后呢
Then what?

1411
01:51:44,060 --> 01:51:45,040
长官
Sir?

1412
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:49,270
我们完全不知道还存在怎样的跨星系威胁
We have no idea what other intergalactic threats are out there.

1413
01:51:49,370 --> 01:51:51,460
而我们的单人女子保安
And our one-woman security force

1414
01:51:51,470 --> 01:51:54,810
还要优先处理宇宙另一边的问题
had a prior commitment on the other side of the universe.

1415
01:51:57,660 --> 01:51:59,790
单靠神盾局不足以保护我们
S.H.I.E.L.D. alone can't protect us.

1416
01:52:01,460 --> 01:52:02,930
我们需要找到更多的
We need to find more.

1417
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:04,430
更多武器吗
More weapons?

1418
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:06,170
更多英雄
More heroes.

1419
01:52:06,170 --> 01:52:08,060
你觉得还能找到其他她这样的人
You think you can find others like her?

1420
01:52:08,070 --> 01:52:10,370
我们找到了她  而且还是没在找的时候
We found her, and we weren't even looking.

1421
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:13,250
休息一下吧  长官
Get some rest, sir.

1422
01:52:14,350 --> 01:52:16,120
你要做个重要决定呢
You got a big decision to make.

1423
01:55:15,350 --> 01:55:16,830
这真是场噩梦
This is a nightmare.

1424
01:55:18,780 --> 01:55:20,680
我做的噩梦都比这强
I've had better nightmares.

1425
01:55:25,270 --> 01:55:27,580
那玩意停了
So, that thing just stopped doing

1426
01:55:27,580 --> 01:55:29,340
虽然也不知它在干什么
whatever the hell it was doing.

1427
01:55:31,090 --> 01:55:32,170
什么情况
What do we got?

1428
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:36,380
它在发送的信号终于停止了
Whatever signal it was sending finally crapped out.

1429
01:55:36,380 --> 01:55:37,850
我们不是外接了电池吗
I thought we bypassed the battery.

1430
01:55:37,850 --> 01:55:38,680
是的
We did.

1431
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:41,700
电还插着呢  它就是停了
It's still plugged in. It just stopped.

1432
01:55:42,450 --> 01:55:43,870
重启  再发一次信号
Reboot it. Send the signal again.

1433
01:55:43,870 --> 01:55:45,870
我们都不知道这是什么
We don't even know what this is.

1434
01:55:45,870 --> 01:55:48,190
弗瑞知道  照做吧
Fury did. Just do it, please.

1435
01:55:48,490 --> 01:55:50,600
一有信号就告诉我
You tell me the second you get a signal.

1436
01:55:51,290 --> 01:55:53,480
我想知道接收信号的人是谁
I wanna know who's on the other end of that thing.

1437
01:55:56,530 --> 01:55:57,930
弗瑞人呢
Where's Fury?
