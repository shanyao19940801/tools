难道我还拿剑对付它

36
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,120
剑是你的武器 枪是我的专属嘛
It's just, swords were your thing and guns were mine.

37
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,160
但好吧 我们现在都用枪了
But I guess we're both doing guns now.

我在组装这个 这样就能边干活边听歌了

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,590
怪奎尔啊 是他那么爱听歌
Blame Quill. He's the one who loves music so much.

48
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,570
不 其实我同意德拉克斯
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.

49
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,560
现在那个可不重要
That's hardly important right now.

50
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,620
好吧 好啊 奎尔
Okay. Sure, Quill.

51
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,730
不 认真的 我同意德拉克斯
No, seriously, I side with Drax.

52
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,270
我懂 你现在非常认真
No, I understand that. You're being very serious right now.

53
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,630
我能清楚看见你在眨眼
I can clearly see you winking.

54

这怪物的皮太厚了 从外面刺不穿

必须从里面切穿它
I must cut through it from the inside.

66
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,000
不不 德拉克斯 等等
No, no! Drax, wait a minute!

67
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,140
德拉克斯
Drax!

68
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,160
他干什么
What is he doing?

69
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,950
他说皮太厚了
He said the skin is too thick

70
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,290
从外面刺不穿 所以他
to be pierced from the outside, so he...

71
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,010
- 这根本没道理  - 我想告诉他来着
- That doesn't make any sense!  - I tried telling him that!

72
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,200
它的皮不管内外
Skin is the same level of thickness

73
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,790
都一样厚
from the inside as from the outside!

74
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,400
我意识到了
I realize that.

75
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,940
它脖子上有个切口
There is a cut on its neck.

76
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,940
火箭 让它抬头
Rocket, get it to look up.

79
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,010

棱酿电池
Harbulary batteries.

84
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,450
跟我说的完全不搭边
That's nothing like what I just said.

85
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,190
但它们每个都值几万块
But they're worth thousands of units apiece

86
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,640
所以索维林族雇我们保护它们
which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them.

87
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,870
跟这些人打交道小心措辞 他们很容易生气
Careful what you say around these folks. They're easily offended.

88
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,820
冒犯了他们会被处死

我们不能让索维林子民去冒生命危险
We could not risk the lives of our own Sovereign citizens.

身体和头脑都完美无缺
Impeccable, both physically and mentally.

93

我们控制后代的DNA
We control the DNA of our progeny...

95
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,420
我更喜欢用传统办法造人
I guess I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way.

96
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,360
也许哪天你可以给我讲讲历史
Perhaps someday, you could give me a history lesson...

97
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,170
讲讲我们祖先古老的方法
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.

98
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,990

我很荣幸 好的
I would be honored, yes.

以学术研究的名义
In the name of research...

101
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,290
我觉得那会非常
I think that could be pretty...

102
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,680
非常令人反感
pretty repulsive.

103
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,420
我不喜欢随便…
I'm not into that kind of casual...

104
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,600

Oh, please.

我知道她是你妹妹
I understand she is your sister.

109
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,380
她对我来说 只值山达尔的悬赏而已
She's worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar.

110
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,110
她想盗窃电池 被我们的士兵抓了个正着
Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries.

111
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,690
请随意处置她吧
Do with her as you please.

他不是密苏里人 我只知道这些
He ain't from Missouri. That's all I know.

我在你身上看到了
I see it within you.

118
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,780

An unorthodox genealogy.

119

这种混血看起来特别…
A hybrid that seems particularly...

120
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,630
鲁莽
reckless.

121
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,640
你知道吗 我听说你们都是自以为是的混蛋
You know, they told me you people were conceited douchebags...

122
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,580
但那完全不是事实
but that isn't true at all.

123
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,190
糟糕
Oh, shit.

124
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,680
我又用错眼睛了 是吗
I'm using my wrong eye again, aren't I?

125
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,070
我很抱歉 我没想被你发现的
I'm sorry. That was meant to be behind your back.

他们没杀你算你走运
Count yourself blessed they didn't kill you.

127
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,620
还用你说
You're telling me.

128
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,750
你想买点电池吗
You wanna buy some batteries?

129
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,250
好吧 我们把小秃子送去山达尔领赏吧

她说我父亲的那些话
That stuff about my father...

132
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,470
她以为她是谁啊
Who does she think she is?

133
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,990
我知道你对那件事有点敏感
I know you're sensitive about that.

134
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,800
我才没有敏感 我只是不知道他是什么人
I'm not sensitive about it. I just don't know who he is.

135
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,220
如果我看起来像是在跟大祭司调情那很抱歉
Sorry if it seemed like I was flirting with the High Priestess.

136
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,700
我没那个意思
I wasn't.

137
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,140
即使你有我也不在意
I don't care if you were.

138
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,560
我觉得你在意
Well, I feel like you do care.

139
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,700
所以我在道歉 对不起
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!

即使听着最有旋律的音乐
The most melodic song in the world could be playing.

151

She wouldn't even tap her foot.

00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,140
看上去就像是死了
One might assume she was dead.

154
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,330
听起来很性感
That does sound pretty hot.

155
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,890
我下面都要充血了
It would make my nether regions engorge.

156
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,920
好吧 我懂了 没错
Okay. I get it, yes.

157
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,510
我是个舞者 而卡魔拉不是
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

158
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,460
你只需要找到一个跟你一样不着调的女人
You just need to find a woman who is pathetic... like you.

159
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,370
我饿了 那些亚罗根给我来点
I'm hungry. Hand me some of that yaro root.

160
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,230
不行 还没熟
No. It's not ripe yet...

161
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,110
而且我恨你
and I hate you.

162
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,220
你恨我
You hate me?

163
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,260
你丢下了我 自己去偷那块石头了
You left me there while you stole that stone for yourself.

164
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,850
而现在你却像个英雄一样
And yet here you stand, a hero.

165
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,730
很快我就能摆脱这枷锁
I will be free of these shackles soon enough,

166
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,090
然后我会杀了你
and I will kill you.

167
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,330
我发誓
I swear.

168
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,280
不
No.

169
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,440
你会在山达尔的监狱里
You're gonna live out the rest of your days

170
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,780
度过余生
in a prison on Xandar...

171
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,290
做那个白日梦
wishing you could.

172
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,440
奇怪
This is weird.

173
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,550
有一队索维林飞船从后面追上来了
We've got a Sovereign fleet approaching from the rear.

174
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,650
他们为什么要这样
Why would they do that?

175
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,560
可能是因为火箭偷了他们几个电池
Probably because Rocket stole some of their batteries.

176
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,570
老兄
Dude!

177
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,870
哦
Right.

178
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,480
他没偷电池
He didn't steal some of those.

179
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,670
我不知道他们为什么追我们 真奇怪啊
I don't know why they're after us. What a mystery this is.

180
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,850
你怎么想的
What were you thinking?

181
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,790
哥们 那些电池真的很容易偷
Dude, they were really easy to steal!

182
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,270
- 这就是你的辩解  - 拜托
- That's your defense?  - Come on!

183
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,820
你看到那个大祭司高高在上的样子了
You saw how that High Priestess talked down to us.

184
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,490
我这是在教训她
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

185
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,020
我没想到你的动机这么无私
I didn't realize your motivation was altruism.

186
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,090
真是遗憾啊
It's really a shame

187
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,500
那些索维林人没领会到你的好意
the Sovereign have mistaken your intentions...

188
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,410
- 还想杀掉我们  - 说的太对了
- and they're trying to kill us.  - Exactly!

189
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,260
我是在讽刺你
I was being sarcastic!

190
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:53,910
不
Oh, no!

191
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,250
你应该用讽刺的语气 这下我出丑了
You're supposed to use a sarcastic voice! Now I look foolish!

192
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,360
斗嘴先省省好不好
Can we put the bickering on hold

193
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,940
活过这场太空大战再说
until after we survive this massive space battle?

194
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,470
- 更多敌人朝我们来了  - 很好
- More incoming!  - Good!

195
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,250
我想杀杀人
I wanna kill some guys!

196
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,430
你谁也没杀掉
You're not killing anyone.

197
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,400
这些飞船都是遥控驾驶的
All those ships are remotely piloted.

198
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,620
该死
Damn it!

199
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,180
在磨蹭什么 舰队司令
What is the delay, Admiral?

200
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,120
大祭司 那些电池
High Priestess, the batteries,

201
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,120
它们极其易燃
they are exceptionally combustible...

202
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,580
可能会摧毁整个舰队
and could destroy the entire fleet.

203
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,580
我们在意的是他们对我们的不敬
Our concern is their slight against our people.

204
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,370
我们雇佣了他们 他们却偷我们的
We hired them and they steal from us.

205
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,680
这是最大的亵渎
It is heresy of the highest order.

206
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,670
所有操作单位
All command modules...

207
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,820
对目标格杀勿论
fire with the intent to kill.

208
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,150
最近的宜居星球是哪里
What's the nearest habitable planet?

209
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,330
是一个叫博赫特的星球
It's called Berhert.

210
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,340
- 需要几次星际跳跃  - 只要一次
- How many jumps?  - Only one.

211
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,840
但进入点在四十七公里外
But the access point is 47 clicks away.

212
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,190
而且你得穿过那片量子小行星群
And you have to go through that quantum asteroid field.

213
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,710
奎尔 要想穿过那里
Quill, to make it through that

214
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,870
你得是全宇宙最棒的飞行员
you'd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.

215
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,230
那我们走运了
Lucky for us,

216
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,850
- 我就…  - 我就是
- I...  - I am.

217
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,370
你在干什么
What are you doing?

218
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,570
我从十岁就开始开这玩意了
I've been flying this rig since I was 10 years old.

219
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,520
我就是为开宇宙飞船而设计制造的
I was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft.

220
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,260
你就是设计制造成了个混蛋
You were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag!

221
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,680
- 别闹了  - 奎尔
- Stop it.  - Quill.

222
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,800
今天晚上 你躺在床上的时候
Later on tonight, you're gonna be laying down in your bed

223
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,860
你的枕套里会有黏糊糊的一坨
and there's gonna be something squishy in your pillow case.

224
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,290
你会想“这是什么”
And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"

225
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,090
那会是我放的一坨屎
And it's gonna be because I put a turd in there!

226
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,370
你敢把你的屎放我床上 我就剃光你
You put your turd in my bed, I shave you.

227
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,110
才不会放我的
It won't be my turd.

228
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,590
我会放德拉克斯的
It will be Drax's.

229
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,140
我的屎蛋出了名的大
I have famously huge turds.

230
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,620
我们都快要死了 现在就讨论这个吗
We're about to die, and this is what we're discussing?

231
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,120
混蛋
Son of a...

232
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,950
哥们 搞什么
Dude! Seriously!

233
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,360
我来…
Let me...

234
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,290
蠢货
Idiots!

235
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,720
奎尔开飞船就这下场
Well, that's what you get when Quill flies.

236
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,790
还有一架索维林飞船在追我们
We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.

237
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,020
我们武器坏了
Our weapons are down.

238
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,620
还有二十公里跳跃
Twenty clicks to the jump!

239
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,950
坐稳了
Hold on.

240
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,240
还没熟呢
It's not ripe.

241
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,850
[应急宇航服 也可以穿着玩]

242
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,240
加油 扎莱克 你可以的
Come on, Zylak. You can do this.

243
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,830
太棒了
Yes!

244
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,180
还有十五公里跳跃
Fifteen clicks to the jump!

245
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,060
加油
Come on!

246
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,990
继续
Keep going!

247
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,120
还有十公里
Ten clicks!

248
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,540
去死吧 破船
Die, spaceship!

249
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,590
你弱爆了 扎莱克
You suck, Zylak.

250
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,620
不出所料
Typical.

251
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,740
还有五公里
Five clicks!

252
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,710
混蛋
Son of a...

253
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,960
他们绕过了星群
They went around the field!

254
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,090
有人摧毁了我们所有的飞船
Someone destroyed all our ships!

255
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,740
什么
What?

256
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,840
是谁
Who?

257
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,100
还有一公里
One click!

258
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,780
- 那是什么  - 管他呢
- What is that?  - Who cares?

259
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,190
跳跃点就在那儿 快 快
That's the jump point! Go! Go!

260
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,200
那是个人
It's a guy.

261
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,340
天啊
Oh, my God.

262
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,670
他还在外面吗
He's still out there?

263
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,470
格鲁特 系好安全带
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

264
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,200
准备好要强行降落了
Prepare for a really bad landing!

265
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:03,430
[博赫特星]

266
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,280
刚才太赞了
That was awesome!

267
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,190
棒
Yes!

268
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,280
你看看
Look at this!

269
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,000
咱们飞船的另一半呢
Where is the other half of our ship?

270
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,830
是我的船
My ship.

271
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,840
你们任何一个都可以带我们平安穿过星群
Either one of you could have gotten us through that field...

272
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,730
如果你们肯用上面这个
had you flown with what's between your ears

273
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,370
而不是下面那个驾驶飞船
instead of what's between your legs!

274
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,340
如果我下面那个长了手
If what's between my legs had a hand on it...

275
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,340
那我绝对可以用它来降落飞船
I guarantee I could have landed this ship with it.

276
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,160
彼得
Peter,

277
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,330
我们差点被你的傲慢害死
we almost died because of your arrogance.

278
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,730
是因为他偷能量电池还差不多
More like because he stole the Anulax batteries!

279
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,100
那个叫棱酿电池
They're called Harbulary batteries.

280
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,500
不 不叫那个
No, they're not!

281
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,970
你知道我为什么那么做吗 星嚼
Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch?

282
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,670
我才不叫“星嚼”
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."

283
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,750
因为我乐意
I did it because I wanted to!

284
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,350
混蛋
Dick.

285
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,650
我们为什么要讨论这个
What are we even talking about this for?

286
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,650
刚才有个小人炸了五十艘飞船救了我们
We just had a little man save us by blowing up 50 ships!

287
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,660
有多小
How little?

288
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,670
我也不知道 大概这么小
Well, I don't know, like this?

289
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,680
一个一英寸的小人救了我们吗
A little one-inch man saved us?

290
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,000
他要是近一点 肯定就会大一点吧
Well, if he got closer, I'm sure he would be much larger.

291
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,360
那叫近大远小 你个傻浣熊
That's how eyesight works, you stupid raccoon.

292
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,100
别叫我浣熊
Don't call me a raccoon!

293
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,660
抱歉 是我过分了
I'm sorry. I took it too far.

294
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,120
我是想说垃圾熊猫
I meant trash panda.

295
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,310
那样好听点吗
Is that better?

296
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,840
我不知道
I don't know.

297
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,200
这个更损 这个损多了
It's worse. It's so much worse.

298
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,650
你个混蛋
You son of a...

299
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,950
- 我受够你了  - 别过来
- I've had it with you!  - No! Back up!

300
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,980
有人从跳跃点跟着你们来了
Someone followed you through the jump point.

301
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,160
放了我 你们需要我帮忙
Set me free, you'll need my help.

302
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,000
我又不傻 星云
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

303
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,090
如果在战斗中拒绝帮助就是犯傻
You are a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat.

304
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,860
我一放了你 你就会攻击我的
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.

305
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,660
我不会的
No, I won't.

306
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,200
你这种超级大坏蛋不是应该很会说谎吗
You'd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.

307
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,210
我赌是那个一英寸的小人
I bet it's the one-inch man.

308
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,670
时隔这么多年 我终于找到你了
After all these years, I've found you.

309
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,280
你到底是谁
And who the hell are you?

310
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,260
我以为我沧桑帅气的外表就足以说明了
I figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious.

311
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,550
我叫伊戈
My name is Ego...

312
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,140
我是你爸爸 彼得
and I'm your dad, Peter.

313
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,460
[康特阿克夏星]

314
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,600
你知道俗话怎么说的
You know what they say...

315
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,330
“跟过鸭鸭 好运就来”
"You're out of luck until you've gone duck."

316
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,320
勇度
Yondu!

317
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,350
快下来
Come on down!

318
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:36,140
兜兜转转这么多年
After going around years in circles...

319
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,680
跟我最终娶的这女人周旋
with this woman I end up marrying.

320
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,440
我说 “艾丽塔 我爱你
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...

321
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,030
但你真是疯了”
"But you're losing your mind!"

322
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,030
话说回来 她一直都那样
Then again, she's always been that way.

323
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,710
我从来都不能相信她
I could never trust her. You know?

324
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,390
斯塔卡
Stakar.

325
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,790
好久不见
It's been some time.

326
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,170
看来这个场子
It seems like this establishment

327
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,520
堕落错了方式
is the wrong kind of disreputable.

328
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,510
- 先生  - 斯塔卡
- Sir!  - Stakar!

329
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,860
掠夺者有一百个派系
There's a hundred Ravager factions.

330
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,190
你为了接待其中一个 而失去了剩下九十九个的
You lost the business of 99 of them by serving one.

331
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,840
求你了 先生 别走
Please, sir. Please!

332
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,650
- 别碰我  - 求你
- Get away from me.  - Please!

333
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,800
你下地狱吧
You can go to hell then!

334
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,940
我不在乎你怎么看我
I don't give a damn what you think of me!

335
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,690
那你跟着我们干什么
So what are you following us for?

336
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,320
因为你必须听我说
Because you're gonna listen to what I gotta say!

337
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,550
我什么都不用听 是你背叛了准则
I don't gotta listen to nothing! You betrayed the code!

338
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,590
掠夺者不买卖孩子
Ravagers don't deal in kids.

339
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,370
我告诉过你 我不知道是怎么回事
I told you before! I didn't know what was going on!

340
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,140
你不知道
You didn't know

341
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,120
是因为你不想知道
because you didn't want to know

342
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,200
因为你靠这个发财
because it made you rich.

343
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,900
我要求有一席之地 我跟你们一样佩戴焰标
I demand a seat at the table! I wear these flames, same as you.

344
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,330
你虽然穿得像我们
You may dress like us...

345
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,420
但你死后别想听到自由号角声 勇度
but you'll never hear the Horns of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

346
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,770
奥戈尔的颜色
And the Colors of Ogord...

347
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,740
也绝不会在你的墓上闪耀
will never flash over your grave.

348
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,620
要是你觉得
If you think...

349
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:04,180
流放你 让我高兴
I take pleasure in exiling you...

350
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,770
那你就错了
you're wrong.

351
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,810
你伤了我们所有人的心
You broke all our hearts.

352
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,150
可悲
Pathetic.

353
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,890
起先 奎尔背叛了我们
First, Quill betrays us...

354
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,130
结果勇度把他毫发无伤地放走了
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.

355
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,140
我们跟随他 是因为他
We followed him because he was the one

356
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,890
敢做不得不做的事
who wasn't afraid to do what needed to be done.

357
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,330
看来他变软弱了
Seems he's goin' soft.

358
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,990
要是他软弱 你这么小声干吗
If he's so soft, why are you whispering for?

359
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,360
你知道我说得对 克拉林
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

360
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,620
小心点 怎么说我们船长呢
You best be very careful what you say about our captain.

361
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,350
这是谁
Who the hell is that?

362
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,360
勇度·尤冬塔
Yondu Udonta...

363
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,870
我有个提议
I have a proposition for you.

364
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,930
你母亲去世后
I hired Yondu to pick you up

365
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,780
我雇了勇度去接你
when your mother passed away.

366
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,930
但他没有把你还给我
But instead of returning you...

367
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,420
而是把你留下了
Yondu kept you.

368
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,150
我不知道为什么
I have no clue as to why.

369
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,930
我告诉你为什么
Well, I'll tell you why.

370
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,620
因为我是个瘦得皮包骨的小孩
Because I was a skinny little kid

371
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,320
能溜进成年人进不去的地方
who could squeeze into places adults couldn't.

372
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,010
偷东西更容易
It made it easier for thievin'.

373
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,440
从那时起 我就一直在寻找你的下落
Well, I've been trying to track you down ever since.

374
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,370
我还以为勇度是你父亲
I thought Yondu was your father.

375
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,740
什么 我们在一起这么久
What? We've been together this whole time

376
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,370
你以为勇度是我的血亲
and you thought Yondu was my actual blood relative?

377
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,180
你俩长得一模一样
You look exactly alike.

378
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,800
勇度是蓝的
One's blue!

379
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,280
不 他不是我父亲
No, he's not my father!

380
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,370
勇度绑架了我
Yondu was the guy who abducted me

381
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,520
把我打得满地找牙 让我学会怎么打架
kicked the crap out of me so I could learn to fight

382
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,150
威胁要吃了我 让我一直担惊受怕
and kept me in terror by threatening to eat me.

383
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,720
- 吃了你  - 是啊
- Eat you?  - Yeah.

384
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,580
那个王八蛋
That son of a bitch.

385
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,340
你怎么找到我们的
How'd you locate us now?

386
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,960
哪怕像我住得那么偏僻
Even where I reside, out past the edge of what's known

387
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,770
也听说过传说中的星爵
we've heard tell about the man they call Star-Lord.

388
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,660
我们现在就出发去那儿怎么样
What say we head out there right now?

389
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,200
欢迎你的伙伴一起去
Your associates are welcome.

390
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,220
包括那只三角脸猴子
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.

391
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,780
我保证
I promise you...

392
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,640
那是一个与众不同的地方
it's unlike any other place you've ever seen.

393
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,120
在那里
And there...

394
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:51,040
我能给你解释你特别的身世
I can explain your very special heritage.

395
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,590
终于能做
Finally get to be the...

396
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,580
我一直想做的那个父亲了
father I've always wanted to be.

397
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,020
失陪了
Excuse me.

398
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,370
我去撒泡尿
I've gotta take a whiz.

399
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,880
我不信
I'm not buying it.

400
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,830
我们去散步吧
Let's go take a walk.

401
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,510
我叫螳螂
I am Mantis.

402
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,520
你在干什么
What are you doing?

403
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,040
微笑
Smiling.

404
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,130
我听说 这样做能让人们喜欢你
I hear it is the thing to do to make people like you.

405
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,270
你那么笑可不能
Not if you do it like that.

406
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:39,320
我一个人在伊戈的星球上长大
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

407
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,300
我不了解人际交流的微妙
I do not understand the intricacies of social interaction.

408
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,940
我能摸摸你的狗狗吗 它好可爱
Can I pet your puppy? It is adorable.

409
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,460
可以
Yes.

410
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,610
这叫恶作剧
That is called a practical joke!

411
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,090
我很喜欢
I liked it very much!

412
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,240
是我刚想的
I just made it up!

413
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,460
饶了我吧
Give me a break!

414
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,020
都过了这么久了 突然出现
After all this time, you're gonna show up,

415
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,830
- 还突然要当我爸  - 是啊
- and just all of a sudden you wanna be my dad?  - I hear you.

416
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,190
另外 这可能是个陷阱 好吗
And by the way, this could be a trap. Okay?

417
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,910
克里纯种主义者 掠夺者
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...

418
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,990
- 都想杀死我们  - 我知道 但是…
- they all want us dead.  - I know, but...

419
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:29,910
但是什么
But what?

420
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,710
你给我讲的扎渡·霍索妇的故事呢
What was that story you told me about Zardu Hasselfrau?

421
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,570
谁
Who?

422
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,260
有一艘魔法船的那个
He owned a magic boat?

423
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,310
大卫·霍索夫
David Hasselhoff?

424
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:38,940
就是他
Right.

425
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,440
不是魔法船 是会说话的车
Not a magic boat. A talking car.

426
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,720
为什么会说话来着
Why did he talk again?

427
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,200
为了帮他打击犯罪 并给予精神支持
To help him fight crime, and to be supportive.

428
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,940
你小时候会随身带着他的照片
As a child, you would carry his picture in your pocket

429
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,970
告诉其他小孩
and you would tell all the other children

430
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,410
说他是你父亲 但他出门了
that he was your father, but that he was out of town.

431
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,010
拍摄《霹雳游侠》或者跟乐队在德国巡回演出
Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany.

432
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,380
那是我喝醉时告诉你的
I told you that when I was drunk.

433
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,600
你现在提它干吗
Why are you bringing that up now?

434
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,820
我喜欢那个故事
I love that story.

435
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,640
我讨厌那个故事
I hate that story.

436
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,350
太可悲了
It's so sad!

437
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,440
我小时候总是看着其他孩子
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids off

438
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,600
跟他们的爸爸玩投接球
playing catch with their dad. And I

439
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,690
我也想让爸爸陪我玩 那是我最大的心愿
I wanted that, more than anything in the world!

440
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,530
我就想说这个 彼得
That's my point, Peter.

441
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,770
如果这个人就是你的霍索夫呢
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?

442
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,870
听着 如果我们发现他是坏人
Listen, if he ends up being evil...

443
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,130
那就杀了他
we will just kill him.

444
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,240
你要把我丢给那只狐狸
You're leaving me with that fox?

445
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,560
他不是狐狸
He's not a fox.

446
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,780
要是她行为可疑 就开枪打她
Shoot her if she does anything suspicious.

447
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,710
- 或者你想打就打  - 好
- Or if you feel like it.  - Okay.

448
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,120
就几天而已
It'll be just a couple of days.

449
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,740
还没等火箭修好飞船 我们就能回来了
We'll be back before Rocket's finished fixing the ship.

450
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,290
要是索维林人来了怎么办
What if the Sovereign come?

451
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,610
他们不可能知道我们在这儿 走吧
There's no way for them to know we're here. Let's go.

452
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,850
我觉得兵分两路不太好
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

453
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,240
天啊 你就像个老太婆
God, you're like an old woman.

454
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,980
因为我睿智吗
Because I'm wise?

455
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,060
你怎么有这么多行李
Why do you have so much luggage?

456
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,030
我不想让格鲁特乱动我的东西
I don't want Groot playing with my things.

457
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,950
希望老爸不像你那么混蛋 小孤儿
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.

458
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,520
你的目的是什么 让所有人都讨厌你吗
What is your goal here? To get everybody to hate you?

459
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,320
你成功了
Because it's working.

460
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,150
我能问你个私人问题吗
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

461
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,070
还没人问过我私人问题呢
No one has ever asked me a personal question.

462
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,710
你的触角是干什么的
Your antennae, what are they for?

463
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,460
触角的用途
Their purpose?

464
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,420
对 奎尔和我打了个赌
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.

465
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,310
哥们 你不应该说出来的
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!

466
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,530
我说
I say...

467
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,160
当你要穿过一个很低的门框时
that if you are about to go through a doorway that is too low...

468
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,730
你的触角能感知高度
your antennae will feel this,

469
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,350
防止你撞掉脑袋
and keep you from being decapitated.

470
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,060
对 如果是任何
Right. And if it's anything other than

471
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,090
防止掉脑袋之外的用途 那我赢
you specifically not being decapitated by a doorway, I win.

472
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:39,420
它们不是感知门框用的
They are not for feeling doorways.

473
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,560
我觉得
I think...

474
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:45,020
它们跟我的共情能力有关
they have something to do with my empathic abilities.

475
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,190
那是什么
What are those?

476
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,410
我触碰别人时 我能感觉到他们的感受
If I touch someone, I can feel their feelings.

477
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,470
- 你会读心术  - 不是
- You read minds?  - No.

478
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,740
心灵感应是感知想法
Telepaths know thoughts.

479
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,390
共情是感知感情
Empaths feel feelings.

480
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,220
情绪
Emotions.

481
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,210
可以吗
May I?

482
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,700
好
All right.

483
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,030
你怀着爱
You feel love.

484
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,320
是的 我怀着一种
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,

485
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,730
- 对所有人的无私的大爱  - 不
- unselfish love for just about everybody.  - No!

486
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,200
是浪漫的 肉欲的爱
Romantic, sexual love.

487
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,390
我才没
No, I don't.

488
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,070
- 爱的是她  - 不
- For her!  - No!

489
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,280
不是
That is not...

490
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:31,990
好吧
Okay.

491
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:38,140
她把你最不可告人的秘密说出来了
She just told everyone your deepest, darkest secret!

492
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,160
哥们 拜托 你有点反应过度了
Dude, come on, I think you're overreacting a little bit!

493
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,540
你肯定尴尬死了
You must be so embarrassed!

494
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,250
来感知一下我 试试我
Do me! Do me! Do me!

495
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,540
我从来没感觉过如此的幽默
I have never felt such humor!

496
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,410
真是讨厌到难以置信
So unbelievably uncool.

497
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,250
奎尔
Quill.

498
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:10,510
敢摸我 你就只能感觉到下巴骨折
Touch me, and the only thing you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.

499
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:20,150
我也可以稍微改变人的情绪
I can also alter emotions to some extent.

500
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,340
比如
Yeah, like what?

501
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,830
如果我碰到悲伤的人
If I touch someone who is sad...

502
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,560
我可以安抚他们 让他们获得暂时的满足感
I can ease them into contentment for a short while.

503
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,250
我可以让固执的人变顺从
I can make a stubborn person compliant.

504
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,630
但我主要用我的能力帮助主人入睡
But I mostly use it to help my master sleep.

505
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,370
他夜里想着后代 无法入睡
He lies awake at night thinking about his progeny.

506
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,420
在我身上试试那个
Do one of those on me.

507
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,990
睡吧
Sleep.

508
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,650
我喜欢这首歌
I love this song.

509
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,640
在那儿
There!

510
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,740
没了那些玩具 你就没那么厉害了吧
Ain't so tough now without all your toys...

511
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,640
是不是
are you?

512
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
闪开
Move!

513
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,810
糟了
Crap.

514
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,980
好啊 耗子
Hey there, rat!

515
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,150
你好吗 你个蓝蠢货
How's it going, you blue idiot?

516
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,540
还不错
Not so bad.

517
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,820
我们接了一份美差
We got ourselves a pretty good little gig here.

518
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:20,450
有个自命不凡的金闪闪的姑娘
This golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself has

519
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,190
给我们开出很高的价码
offered us a large sum

520
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,870
要我们抓到你和你的同伴交给她
to deliver you and your pals over to her

521
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,690
因为她想杀了你们
because she wants to kill y'all.

522
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,570
你的朋友
Your friend...

523
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,580
敌人太多了
There's too many of them.

524
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,330
他需要我帮忙 要是你在乎他
He needs my help. If you care about him...

525
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,280
你得帮我解开手铐
you need to get me out of these bonds.

526
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,260
他们会杀了他的
They are going to kill him!

527
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,820
告诉你 找到你可容易了
I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.

528
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,720
山达尔大战的时候 我在你们飞船上
I put a tracer on your ship back there

529
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,430
放了个追踪器
during the war over Xandar.

530
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,830
你保证不伤害格鲁特
Give me your word you won't hurt Groot...

531
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,310
我就告诉你电池在哪
and I'll tell you where the batteries are.

532
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,600
你真走运 我说话不算数
Lucky for you, my word don't mean squat.

533
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,570
不然我就把你们交出去了
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

534
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,490
不然你就什么
Otherwise, you'd what?

535
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,630
我们把电池拿走
We'll take them batteries.

536
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:03,050
它们值多少 在市场上能卖个二十五万
They're worth what? A quarter mill on the open market?

537
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,630
那个祭司答应给我们一百万
That Priestess offered us a million.

538
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:08,630
二十五万才三分之一
A quarter is only one third of that!

539
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,880
二十五万不是三分之一
A quarter ain't a third.

540
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,090
二十五万就是二十五
A quarter is 25.

541
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:12,740
不是
No.

542
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,460
二十五连双靴子都卖不来
We can't even buy a pair of boots with 25 units.

543
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,430
够了
Enough!

544
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,390
重点是 我们没那么蠢
The point is, we ain't stupid enough

545
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,840
会帮忙把银河护卫队杀掉
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

546
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,380
整个新星军团都不会放过我们的
The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.

547
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,990
这样不对
That ain't right!

548
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,640
我就说这一次 船长
I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.

549
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,990
不管奎尔背叛你几次
No matter how many times Quill betrays you

550
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,830
你都会保护他 就好像我们其他人都不重要
you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!

551
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:36,900
是啊
Yeah!

552
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,850
我才是会支持你的人
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

553
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:39,690
别激动 克拉林
Take it easy, Kraglin.

554
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:42,600
说对了 伙计 他是心变软了
Damn straight, lad. He's gone soft.

555
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,800
或许改换个领导人了
Suppose it's time for a change in leadership.

556
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,860
放下你们的枪
Put your damn guns down!

557
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,910
这事肯定是可以和平解决的 各位
There must be some kind of peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

558
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,720
哪怕是武力解决也好 只要我站那边
Or even a violent one where I'm standing over there.

559
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,780
你们好啊 小伙子们
Well, hello, boys.

560
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,740
没熟
It's not ripe.

561
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:56,350
[伊戈的星球]

562
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:17,060
各位 欢迎来到我的世界
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

563
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,110
你有自己的星球
You have your own planet?

564
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:23,380
没什么的 也不比地球的月亮大
Come on. No larger than your Earth's Moon.

565
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,010
谦逊
Humility.

566
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,550
我喜欢
I like it.

567
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,850
我也是个非常谦虚的人
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

568
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:13,330
你有自己的星球
You own a planet

569
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,130
还能不穿太空服就干掉几十艘飞船
and can destroy two dozen spaceships without a suit.

570
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,360
你究竟是什么人
What are you exactly?

571
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,090
我是所谓的天神 亲爱的
I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.

572
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,140
天神 你是个神吗
A Celestial, like a god?

573
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,500
就是个普通神 儿子
Small "G," Son.

574
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,800
至少在我跟德拉克斯一样谦逊的日子里是的
At least on the days I'm feeling humble as Drax.

575
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:51,530
我也不知道我究竟从哪来
I don't know where I came from exactly.

576
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,180
我最初的记忆是闪烁
First thing I remember is flickering

577
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,430
漂浮在宇宙中
adrift in the cosmos utterly

578
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,470
完全孤独地存在着
and entirely alone.

579
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:02,710
经历了数百万年
Over millions of years

580
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:06,480
我学会了控制我周围的分子
I learned to control the molecules around me.

581
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:10,040
我越来越聪明 越来越强大
I grew smarter and stronger.

582
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,950
我不断地建造着
And I continued building from there...

583
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,830
一层又一层
layer by layer...

584
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:19,850
最终建成了你们现在脚下的星球
the very planet you walk on now.

585
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:23,370
但我不满足
But I wanted more.

586
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,480
我渴望
I desired...

587
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,320
意义
meaning.

588
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,360
我想着 这宇宙中肯定还有
"There must be some life out there in the universe...

589
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,690
我之外的生命
"Besides just me," I thought.

590
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,470
于是 我立志要找到生命
And so, I set myself the task of finding it.

591
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,580
我创造了
I created...

592
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,360
我所想象的生物生命
what I imagined biological life to be like...

593
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:49,620
包括最细微的细节
down to the most minute detail.

594
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,970
你做老二了吗
Did you make a penis?

595
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:52,840
哥们
Dude!

596
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,300
你什么毛病啊
What is wrong with you?

597
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,990
如果他是个星球 怎么能跟你母亲造人啊
If he is a planet, how could he make a baby with your mother?

598
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,550
他会压扁她的
He would smush her!

599
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:03,480
我不想听我父母是怎么…
I don't need to hear how my parents...

600
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,550
为什么
Why?

601
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:07,990
我父亲每年冬至
My father would tell the story of

602
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:09,980
都会讲述他让我母亲怀孕的故事
impregnating my mother every winter solstice.

603
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,130
太恶心了
That's disgusting.

604
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,970
那很美
It was beautiful.

605
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,940
你们地球人真有病
You Earthers have hang-ups.

606
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,930
是啊 德拉克斯 我有老二
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.

607
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:20,500
谢谢
Thank you!

608
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,960
而且不赖
It's not half bad.

609
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:27,080
我还有痛觉 消化系统
I've also got pain receptors, and a digestive system and

610
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:29,570
和所有附带的一切
all the accompanying junk.

611
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:34,140
我想真正地体验为人
I wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human

612
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,940
于是我探索群星
as I set out amongst the stars...

613
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,830
直到我找到了
until I found...

614
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,460
我所寻找的
what I sought.

615
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,390
生命
Life.

616
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,580
我在这宇宙中终究不是孤独的
I was not alone in the universe after all.

617
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,130
你什么时候认识我母亲的
When did you meet my mother?

618
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,930
不久之后
Not long after.

619
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:13,880
是梅瑞狄斯让我第一次体验了爱
It was with Meredith that I first experienced love.

620
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,240
我
I

621
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,820
喊她我的水百合
called her my river lily.

622
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,330
那份爱 彼得
And from that love, Peter...

623
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,140
创造了你
you.

624
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,580
我找了你好久
I have searched for you for so long.

625
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,600
当我听说一个地球人
And when I heard of a man from Earth

626
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,850
手握无限宝石还能不死
who held an Infinity Stone in his hand without dying...

627
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:55,140
我就知道你一定是我所爱的女人的儿子
I knew you must be the son of the woman I loved.

628
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,720
如果你爱她 为什么要离开她
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

629
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,510
这是哗变
This is mutiny!

630
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,190
这是哗变
This is mutiny!

631
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,220
这是哗变
This is mutiny!

632
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,110
你们这些渣滓
You're scum!

633
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:17,850
船长
Captain!

634
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:20,610
救我啊
Help me! Please!

635
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:21,670
船长
Captain!

636
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,490
是你害死了那些人
You're the one what killed those men

637
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,830
你领他们走错了路
by leading them down the wrong path.

638
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,870
因为你软弱
Because you're weak.

639
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,920
还愚蠢
And stupid!

640
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:40,490
现在 掠夺者
It's time for the Ravagers

641
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:44,520
要再次恢复荣誉 追随新船长
to rise once again to glory with a new captain...

642
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:47,900
电击脸
Taserface!

643
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:57,890
抱歉 抱歉 你名叫
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Your name is...

644
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,770
电击脸
It's Taserface?

645
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,210
没错
That's right.

646
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,410
你的脸有电击能力吗
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?

647
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,040
是个比喻
It's metaphorical!

648
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,440
是啊
Yeah!

649
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:12,340
比喻什么
For what?

650
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,930
比喻
For

651
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,330
这个名字能让任何
it is a name what strikes fear

652
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:20,330
听到它的人 心生恐惧
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.

653
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:23,910
嗯
Okay.

654
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:25,940
好吧
Okay...

655
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,320
随你说吧
whatever you say.

656
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:28,960
你闭嘴
You shut up.

657
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,120
你就是下一个
You're next.

658
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:35,350
尤冬塔 我等了好久…
Udonta, I have waited a long time to do...

659
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:36,160
怎么了
What?

660
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:40,480
对不起 真对不起
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

661
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,350
我就是一直在想象 先生 你早上醒来
I just keep imagining you waking up in the morning, sir,

662
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:44,210
看着镜子
looking in the mirror

663
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,530
严肃地对自己说
and then in all seriousness saying to yourself,

664
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:51,550
“知道什么名字特别拽吗 电击脸”
"You know what would be a really kick-ass name? Taserface!"

665
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,980
我想象你就是这样
That's how I hear you in my head!

666
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,340
你的第二选择是什么
What was your second choice?

667
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,020
阴囊帽吗
Scrotum Hat?

668
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,360
新计划 我们先杀你
New plan. We're killing you first.

669
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:06,260
好吧
Well,

670
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:09,980
死也比做一辈子的
dying is certainly better than having to live an entire life

671
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:13,950
混蛋白痴 觉得电击脸很酷强
as a moronic shitbag who thinks Taserface is a cool name.

672
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:16,660
今天就杀到这儿吧
That's enough killing for today.

673
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,240
她是灭霸的女儿
She's the daughter of Thanos.

674
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:27,160
我以为你是银河系头号的施虐狂
I thought you were the biggest sadist in the galaxy.

675
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,370
那是爸爸雇我的时候
That was when Daddy was paying my bills.

676
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:32,640
大祭司想亲手杀了那狐狸
The Priestess wants to kill the fox herself.

677
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,100
而至少有十二个克里省在通缉他
And he has bounties on his head in at least 12 Kree provinces.

678
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,700
我保证
I assure you...

679
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,850
我可不像离了魔法棍子的老头子
I am not as easy a mark as an old man without his magic stick...

680
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,810
或会说话的森林野兽那么好对付
or a talking woodland beast.

681
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,990
我要百分之十的赏金
I want 10% of the take...

682
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,660
还有几样东西
and a couple more things.

683
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,920
我们有一整盒的手
We got a whole box of hands...

684
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,320
- 如果那个不行的话  - 挺好的
- if that one don't work out.  - It is fine.

685
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,460
你觉得克里人会处死船长吗
You think them Kree is gonna execute the captain?

686
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:04,170
克里人自视仁慈 不会让他痛苦的
The Kree consider themselves merciful. It will be painless.

687
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:08,460
就在这儿 这是我们最好的一艘船
Well, here it is. It's the best ship we got.

688
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,460
伊戈星球的位置发到导航里了
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.

689
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,700
等我们拿到钱就把那百分之十汇给你
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.

690
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,780
你打算拿你的那份做什么
What are you gonna do with your share?

691
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,210
我还是孩子时 我父亲会让
As a child, my father would have

692
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:19,770
我和卡魔拉在训练中对打
Gamora and me battle one another in training.

693
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,050
每次我姐姐赢了
Every time my sister prevailed

694
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:26,160
我父亲就会把我身体的一部分换成机械
my father would replace a piece of me with machinery

695
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:29,470
他说是希望我能像她一样强
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

696
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,930
但她总赢
But she won...

697
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:37,790
一次又一次 从没一次手下留情
again and again, and again, never once refraining.

698
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:40,880
所以等我杀了我姐姐
So after I murder my sister...

699
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,080
我要买一艘战舰 装上所有杀戮武器
I will buy a warship with every conceivable instrument of death.

700
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,510
我要像抓狗一样找到我父亲
I will hunt my father like a dog,

701
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:48,680
然后慢慢把他撕碎
and I will tear him apart slowly

702
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:50,390
一块一块地拆开
piece by piece...

703
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:54,010
直到他能稍有体会我每一天所经历的
until he knows some semblance of the profound and unceasing pain

704
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:57,100
无休止的深刻痛苦
I know every single day.

705
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,050
哦
Yeah.

706
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,900
我想的是买条漂亮项链什么的
I was talking about, like, a pretty necklace.

707
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,220
或是好看的帽子
Or a nice hat. You know,

708
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:08,650
让其他姑娘都说“哎呀 真漂亮”
something to make the other girls go, "Ooh, that's nice!"

709
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,060
总之 一路顺风
Anyways, happy trails.

710
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:26,240
我母亲跟所有人说我父亲来自星星
My mother told everyone my father was from the stars.

711
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,970
她有脑瘤 所以大家都以为她是在妄想
She had brain cancer, so everyone thought she was delusional.

712
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:31,810
彼得
Peter...

713
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:34,400
听着 我真的很想相信这一切
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this, I really would.

714
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,380
但你离开了这世上最棒的女人
But you left the most wonderful woman ever

715
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:40,190
让她孤独离世
to die alone.

716
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:43,720
我并不想离开你母亲的 彼得
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.

717
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:46,350
如果我不定期回到我的星球
If I don't return regularly to my planet

718
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:47,760
回归其内部的光
and the light within it

719
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:49,370
这个人形将退化消逝
this form will wither and perish.

720
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:51,720
那你为什么不回来 你为什么叫勇度去
So why didn't you come back? Why did you send Yondu?

721
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,980
偏偏叫一个罪犯去接我
A criminal, of all people, to come and fetch me?

722
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,110
我是那么爱你母亲 彼得
I loved your mother, Peter!

723
00:53:56,110 --> 00:54:00,120
我无法忍受去一个再没有她的地球
I couldn't stand to set foot on an Earth where she wasn't living!

724
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,410
你无法想象那是什么感觉
You can't imagine what that's like!

725
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:03,670
我非常清楚那是什么感觉
I know exactly what that feels like!

726
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,010
我不得不看着她死去
I had to watch her die!

727
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,820
我存在了千百万年
Over the millions and millions of years of my existence

728
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,000
犯下了很多错误 彼得
I've made many mistakes, Peter.

729
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,800
但你不是其中之一
But you're not one of them.

730
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,310
请给我个机会
Please give me the chance

731
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:25,590
做她会希望我做的那种父亲
to be the father she would want me to be.

732
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:35,460
关于这个星球 和其内部的光
There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet

733
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,520
我有好多要告诉你
and the light within.

734
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:40,460
那是你的一部分 彼得
They are a part of you, Peter.

735
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:42,970
什么意思
What do you mean?

736
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:45,920
给我你的手 儿子
Give me your hands, son.

737
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:48,220
来
Here.

738
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:50,920
这样端住
Hold them like that.

739
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:54,980
好了
Now,

740
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,780
闭上眼睛 集中精神
close your eyes and concentrate.

741
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,690
让思绪进入星球的中心
Take your brain to the center of this planet.

742
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,100
太好了
Yes!

743
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:11,370
就这样
Yes!

744
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:13,050
太好了
Yes! Yes!

745
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:14,570
- 太棒了 没事  - 怎么回…
- Yes! It's okay.  - What was...

746
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:16,170
放松 集中精神
Just relax. Concentrate.

747
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:17,890
你可以的 再来
You can do it. Bring it back.

748
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:19,630
很好
Yes!

749
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:24,140
很好 好了 塑形
Yes, yes, now shape it.

750
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,800
感受那股能量
Feel that energy.

751
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,550
就这样
Yes.

752
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,730
你回家了
You're home.

753
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,560
彼得
Peter...

754
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:18,180
你是怎么来到这颗奇怪 愚蠢的星球上的
How did you get to this weird, dumb planet?

755
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:21,230
我还是个幼虫时被伊戈发现
Ego found me in my larva state.

756
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,520
我在母星是个孤儿
Orphaned on my homeworld.

757
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:27,810
他亲手养大了我 把我留在了身边
He raised me by hand, and kept me as his own.

758
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:30,090
那么你是个宠物
So you're a pet?

759
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,450
大概是吧
I suppose.

760
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,940
人们一般都养可爱的宠物
People usually want cute pets.

761
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:38,540
伊戈怎么会养个这么面目可憎的
Why would Ego want such a hideous one?

762
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:40,290
我面目可憎吗
I am hideous?

763
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:43,020
你简直丑得惊心动魄
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.

764
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,140
但那是好事
But that's a good thing.

765
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,000
如果你长得丑 还有人爱你
When you're ugly, and someone loves you

766
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,940
你知道那人是爱你这个人
you know they love you for who you are.

767
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,400
美丽的人永远不知道谁能信任
Beautiful people never know who to trust.

768
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,700
那我庆幸我很丑
Well, then I'm certainly grateful to be ugly.

769
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:04,890
那些池塘 让我想起了有次
Those pools, they remind me of a time...

770
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:08,340
我带女儿去我母星的遗忘湖
when I took my daughter to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.

771
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,200
她跟你很像
She was like you.

772
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,710
难看吗
Disgusting?

773
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,010
天真无邪
Innocent.

774
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,860
德拉克斯
Drax?

775
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,610
我得告诉你件事
There's something I must tell you.

776
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,100
怎么回事
What's going on?

777
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:04,420
这位恶心的虫子女士成了我的新朋友
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

778
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:07,560
我学到了很多事 比如我是个宠物 而且很丑
I'm learning many things, like I'm a pet and ugly.

779
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,200
你不丑 德拉克斯
You're not ugly. Drax!

780
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,360
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

781
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,370
螳螂
Mantis...

782
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:14,630
你能带我们去我们的住处吗
can you show us where we'll be staying?

783
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,650
这颗星球上怎么没有其他生物
Why are there no other beings on this planet?

784
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:19,770
这星球就是伊戈
The planet is Ego.

785
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:22,900
狗不会邀请跳蚤来他背上住
A dog would not invite a flea to live on his back.

786
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,370
你不是跳蚤
And you're not a flea?

787
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,320
我是有用的跳蚤
I'm a flea with a purpose.

788
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,820
我帮他入眠
I help him sleep.

789
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:33,150
我走出来之前 你正要跟德拉克斯说什么
What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?

790
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:39,430
没什么
Nothing.

791
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:42,040
你们的住处在这边
Your quarters are this way.

792
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,420
我们明早把你们送去给克里人
We deliver you to the Kree in the morning.

793
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:58,560
之后你俩都活不长了
Neither one of you will last much longer after that.

794
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:01,180
好啊 电击脸
Okay, Taserface.

795
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:06,020
替我们跟其他人问好 电击脸
Tell the other guys we said "Hi," Taserface!

796
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:13,710
这颗小植物呢 要我用石头砸碎它吗
What about this little plant? Can I smash it with a rock?

797
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:15,200
不行 杰夫
No, Gef.

798
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,910
这么可爱怎么能杀掉
It's too adorable to kill.

799
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:18,680
送去裁缝那里
Take it to the tailor.

800
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,640
别介意 但你的雇员都是混蛋
No offense, but your employees are a bunch of jerks.

801
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,310
我做了二十年的克里人战奴 是斯塔卡解救了我
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years when Stakar freed me.

802
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,790
他邀我加入了掠夺者
He offered me a place with the Ravagers.

803
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,020
他说我只需要遵守准则
He said all I needed to do was adhere to the code.

804
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:42,620
但我年轻
But I was young...

805
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:47,240
贪心 愚蠢
and greedy, and stupid.

806
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:50,390
就像你 偷了那些电池
Like you stealing those batteries.

807
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,060
那更多是德拉克斯干的
That was mostly Drax.

808
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:56,530
我和斯塔卡 还有其他船长
Me and Stakar and the other captains...

809
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:00,480
我们跟你和你的朋友很像
we weren't so different from you and your friends.

810
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,400
那是我唯一的家庭
The only family I ever had.

811
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:06,130
我违反准则后
When I broke the code...

812
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,990
他们流放了我
they exiled me.

813
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,180
我活该如此
This is what I deserve.

814
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,190
等等 矫情女王
Slow down, drama queen.

815
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:16,750
你或许是活该 但我不是
You might deserve this, but I don't.

816
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,150
我们得逃出去
We gotta get outta here.

817
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:21,290
奎尔呢
Where's Quill?

818
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:23,800
他跟他老爸走了
He went off with his old man.

819
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:26,380
- 伊戈  - 对
- Ego?  - Yeah.

820
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:28,550
今天净是些蠢蛋名字
It's a day for dumbass names.

821
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:34,330
你笑了 就那么一刻 我有种温暖的感觉
You're smiling. And for a second, I got a warm feeling.

822
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:37,060
但你那一口烂牙毁了这感觉
But then it was ruined by those disgusting-ass teeth.

823
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,590
你是职业混蛋吗
You like a professional asshole or what?

824
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:40,650
挺专业的反正
Pretty much a pro.

825
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:43,440
你为什么没像说好的那样把奎尔送去给伊戈
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego like you promised?

826
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,450
他很瘦小
He was skinny.

827
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:50,060
能钻进我们钻不进的地方 适合偷盗
Could fit into places we couldn't. Good for thievin'.

828
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:57,970
我知道我们怎么出去了
I got an idea on how to get outta here.

829
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:01,520
但我需要你的小朋友
But we're gonna need your little friend.

830
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,620
吉祥物 吉祥物
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

831
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:19,120
小家伙好激动 该喝一杯
Little fellow's all worked up! He needs a drink!

832
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:27,850
看他气成那样多可爱
Look how cute it is when it's all riled up.

833
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,200
他太有趣了
He's goddang precious!

834
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:44,960
小树枝
Hey, twig!

835
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:46,750
过来
Come here.

836
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:48,640
过来
Come on.

837
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,150
天呐 他们把你怎么了
Man... what did they do to you?

838
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,250
你想帮我们出去吗
You wanna help us get outta here?

839
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:07,540
我需要你去找样东西 然后拿来给我
There's something I need you to get, and bring back to me.

840
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:12,120
在船长室 有个原型机机械鳍
In the captain's quarters, there's a prototype fin...

841
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:14,160
就是我脑袋上戴的那玩意
the thing I wore on my head.

842
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:18,650
床铺旁边有个抽屉 就在里面 红色的
There's a drawer next to the bunk. It's in that. It's red.

843
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:19,650
懂了吗
You got it?

844
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:55,370
那是我的内裤
That's my underwears.

845
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:56,140
嗯 我就觉得
Yeah, I was pretty sure

846
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:57,580
他根本就没听懂你说什么
he didn't know what you were talkin' about.

847
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,600
你得解释得更细致点
You have to explain it more careful.

848
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,690
是个原型机机械鳍
It's a prototype fin.

849
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:12,960
那是只奥罗尼 机械鳍 格鲁特
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.

850
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,710
这次你来解释
You explain it this time.

851
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:16,620
好吧
All right.

852
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,180
那是沃克的眼睛
That's Vorker's eye.

853
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:22,220
他睡觉时会拿下来
He takes it out when he sleeps.

854
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:23,520
去 再找
Go. Look again.

855
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,000
把眼睛留下
But leave the eye here.

856
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:26,720
干吗
Why?

857
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:28,500
等他明早醒来
He's gonna wake up tomorrow

858
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:30,510
会不知道
and he's not gonna know

859
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,820
他的眼睛去哪了
where his eye is!

860
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,800
那是张桌子
That's a desk.

861
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:43,220
我们说了那玩意才这么大
We told you it was this big.

862
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,000
拜托告诉我你们船上有个冰箱
Tell me you guys have a refrigerator somewhere

863
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,160
里面全是切下来的人脚趾
with a bunch of severed human toes.

864
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:58,020
好吧 那我们说好永远不再提这事了
Okay. Then let's just agree to never discuss this.

865
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,770
你要打开的抽屉 上面有这个标志
The drawer you wanna open has this symbol on it.

866
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:06,750
好吗
Okay?

867
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,100
什么 不
What? No!

868
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,780
他以为你要他把那个当帽子戴
He thinks you want him to wear it as a hat.

869
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:20,370
我不是那么说的
That's not what I said!

870
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:22,550
- 我是格鲁特  - 他很庆幸你不要求他那么做
- I am Groot.  - He's relieved you don't want him to.

871
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:24,350
- 我是格鲁特  - 他讨厌帽子
- I am Groot.  - He hates hats.

872
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:25,140
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

873
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,550
讨厌任何人戴帽子 不仅是他自己
On anyone, not just himself.

874
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:27,290
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

875
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:29,110
你还以为谁的脑袋形状很怪
One minute you think someone has a weird-shaped head

876
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:30,110
结果转眼发现
the next minute it's just because

877
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:32,030
原来那脑袋上戴了顶帽子
you realize part of that head is the hat.

878
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,930
所以你才不喜欢帽子
That's why you don't like hats?

879
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:37,090
这些话非得现在说吗
This is an important conversation right now?

880
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:15,360
不是那个
That ain't it.

881
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:26,590
我并没想哗变的
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

882
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:31,170
他们杀了我所有的朋友
They killed all my friends.

883
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:37,760
准备释放第三飞行舱
Get the third quadrant ready for release.

884
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,830
还有件事
One more thing.

885
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,710
船上有奎尔那些老歌的备份吗
You got any clones of Quill's old music on the ship?

886
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:41,520
他拿走了
He's got it!

887
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,280
勇度拿走了机械鳍
Yondu's got the fin!

888
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,240
上
Go!

889
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,200
下面
Down there!

890
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:27,350
你个疯子
You maniac.

891
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,040
你会炸掉整艘船的
The whole ship's gonna blow.

892
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,520
不会是整艘船
Not the whole ship.

893
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:00,530
你是谁
Who is this?

894
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:04,700
我要把勇度的飞船的坐标发你
I am sending you the coordinates for Yondu's ship.

895
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,390
- 释放飞行舱  - 是 船长
- Release the quadrant!  - Aye, Captain!

896
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:09,850
我只求一件事
I only ask one thing.

897
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,340
你们的大祭司
That your High Priestess

898
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:16,110
要告诉他是谁注定了他的毁灭
tell him the name of the man what sealed his fate.

899
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:18,770
电击脸
Taserface!

900
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:43,550
去哪 船长
Where to, Captain?

901
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,600
伊戈
Ego.

902
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,720
不行
No, boy!

903
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,220
对于哺乳类来说
It ain't healthy for a mammalian body

904
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,920
一下跳跃五十次以上对身体有害
to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.

905
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,120
我知道
I know that.

906
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:03,870
我们要跳七百次了
We are about to do 700!

907
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:19,770
那么这一切有一天都可能属于我喽
So I guess this could all be mine someday.

908
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:23,620
火箭 火箭 你在吗
Rocket? Rocket, are you there?

909
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:31,880
你在干什么 彼得
What are you doing, Peter?

910
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:35,770
跟我跳舞吧
Dance with me.

911
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,690
我才不跟你跳舞
I'm not going to dance with you.

912
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:39,520
这是山姆·库克的歌
This is Sam Cooke

913
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:42,640
他可是地球最伟大的歌手之一
one of the greatest Earth singers of all time.

914
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:14,360
德拉克斯觉得你不是个舞者
Drax thinks you're not a dancer.

915
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:18,340
你要是敢把这件事说出去
If you ever tell anyone about this...

916
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:19,470
我就杀了你
I will kill you.

917
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,960
我们什么时候处理一下
When are we gonna do something about this

918
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:23,930
我们之间心照不宣的情愫啊
unspoken thing between us?

919
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:26,560
什么心照不宣的情愫
What unspoken thing?

920
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:28,930
就是
This...

921
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,530
像《欢乐酒店》里 萨姆和黛安那样
Cheers, Sam and Diane...

922
01:12:32,650 --> 01:12:35,330
电视剧里相互喜欢的一男一女
a guy and a girl on a TV show who dig each other...

923
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:37,900
但他们从不说破 否则收视率就要下降了
but never say it because if they do, the ratings would go down...

924
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,050
就这种的
sort of thing.

925
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:40,770
才没有什么心照不宣的情愫
There's no unspoken thing.

926
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:44,730
这是二十二条军规 如果你说了
Well, it's a catch-22, because if you said it,

927
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:45,690
那就不叫心照不宣了
then it would be spoken

928
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:48,750
那你就是撒谎了 所以你不说
and you would be a liar. So, by not saying it...

929
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,830
反而是在说实话 也就是承认有
you are telling the truth, and admitting that there is.

930
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,160
不 我不是那个…
No, that's not what I...

931
01:12:57,650 --> 01:12:59,670
我们现在应该说的
What we should be discussing right now

932
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:01,650
是这地方
is something about this place.

933
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,480
有点不对劲
It doesn't feel right.

934
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:05,490
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

935
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,010
是你希望我来的
You're the one who wanted me to come here!

936
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:09,150
那个螳螂女
That girl Mantis

937
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:10,580
她在怕什么
she's afraid of something.

938
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:12,980
你为什么要夺走这一切
Why are you trying to take this away from me?

939
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:14,060
我没有…
I'm not trying...

940
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:16,040
他是我父亲 是我的血亲
He's my father. He's blood.

941
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,870
你在地球也有血亲 你可不想回那儿去
You have blood on Earth and you never wanted to return there.

942
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:19,800
再说一遍 是你逼我来的
Again, you made me come here!

943
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,200
而且地球 地球是我母亲死在我面前的地方
And Earth, Earth is the place where my mother died in front of me.

944
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,480
不 是因为那里是真实的 这里只是个幻想
No, it's because that place is real, and this is a fantasy.

945
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,240
这是真的 我是个半人 记得吗
This is real! I'm only half human, remember?

946
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,000
我担心的就是那一半
That's the half I'm worried about.

947
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:31,750
我懂了 你嫉妒
I get it. You're jealous

948
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:34,630
因为我是半神 而你喜欢我比较弱的时候
because I'm part-god, and you like when I'm the weak one.

949
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:37,150
你本就让人难以忍受
You were insufferable to begin with.

950
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:38,550
我一直联系不上火箭
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.

951
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:40,180
我要出去 看看能不能搜到信号
I'm gonna go outside, and I'm gonna try and get a signal.

952
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:43,180
知道吗 这根本不是《欢乐酒店》
You know what? This is not Cheers after all!

953
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:44,820
在这部剧里
This is whatever the show is

954
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:47,880
一个人愿意敞开心扉面对新的前景
where one person is willing to open themselves up to new possibility,

955
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:49,960
而另一个人却是个混蛋
and the other person is a jerk

956
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:51,640
不信任任何人
who doesn't trust anybody!

957
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,550
这是部不存在的剧
It's a show that doesn't exist.

958
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:55,540
所以它不会有任何收视率
That's why it would get zero ratings!

959
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:57,670
我不知道《欢乐酒店》是什么
I don't know what Cheers is!

960
01:13:57,670 --> 01:14:01,070
我终于找到我的家人了 你不懂吗
I finally found my family. Don't you understand that?

961
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,610
我以为你已经有家人了
I thought you already had.

962
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:34,450
该死
Damn it.

963
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,070
神经病
Psychopath!

964
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:20,510
你搞什么
Are you kidding me?

965
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:48,570
我赢了
I win.

966
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:50,700
我赢了 我打败了你
I win. I bested you in combat.

967
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:53,050
不 是我救了你
No. I saved your life.

968
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:55,160
你留我一命真是太蠢了
Well, you were stupid enough to let me live.

969
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:55,980
是你没下杀手
You let me live!

970
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:58,000
我不需要你总想打赢我
I don't need you always trying to beat me!

971
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,850
我可没刚刚穿越宇宙
I'm not the one that just flew across the universe

972
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:00,870
就为了争个输赢
just because I wanted to win.

973
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:02,590
用不着你告诉我我要什么
Do not tell me what I want.

974
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:04,380
我不用告诉你你要什么
I don't need to tell you what you want!

975
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:04,890
明摆着的
It's obvious!

976
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:08,460
你才是想赢的那个 我只想要个姐姐
You were the one who wanted to win. And I just wanted a sister!

977
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:17,820
我只有你
You were all I had.

978
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,400
但你总想赢
But you were the one who needed to win.

979
01:18:23,290 --> 01:18:25,380
灭霸把我的眼睛挖出来
Thanos pulled my eye from my head

980
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:27,920
把我的大脑取出来
and my brain from my skull

981
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:31,060
把我的胳膊拽下来
and my arm from my body

982
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:34,520
都是因为你
because of you.

983
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:57,350
你没事吧 儿子
You all right, son?

984
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:03,580
我之前看见你女朋友怒气冲冲地走了
I saw your girl stomp off a little earlier in quite a huff.

985
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:04,500
是啊
Yeah.

986
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:08,150
你听这首歌真巧
It's fortuitous you listening to this song.

987
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:10,370
- 你知道…  - 《布兰迪》
- You know...  - Brandy?

988
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:12,040
镜子组合的
By Looking Glass?

989
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:15,120
是你妈妈的最爱
A favorite of your mom's.

990
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:17,230
是啊
Yeah, it was.

991
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:19,660
是地球最伟大的音乐作品之一
One of Earth's greatest musical compositions.

992
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,700
也许就是最伟大的
Perhaps its very greatest.

993
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:22,770
说得太对了
Yeah, yes!

994
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:26,700
彼得 你我就是那首歌里的水手
Peter, you and I, we're the sailor in that song.

995
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:30,230
他在一个夏日出现
He came on a summer's day.

996
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,230
带来远方的礼物
Bringing gifts from far away.

997
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:37,300
就像我让你妈妈怀上的那个孩子
Like the child I put in your mother...

998
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,840
或是你给卡魔拉的自由
or the freedom you brought Gamora.

999
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:44,980
布兰迪 你是个好姑娘
Brandy, you're a fine girl.

1000
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,510
你肯定会是个好妻子
What a good wife you would be.

1001
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:51,520
我的生活 我的爱
My life, my love.

1002
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,460
我的女人是大海
My lady is the sea.

1003
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:57,130
大海召唤着水手
The sea calls the sailor back.

1004
01:19:57,130 --> 01:20:00,090
他爱那姑娘 但那里不是他的天地
He loves the girl, but that's not his place.

1005
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,960
大海召唤他 就像历史召唤伟人
The sea calls upon him as history calls upon great men.

1006
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:09,350
有时我们无法享受凡人的乐趣
And sometimes we are deprived the pleasures of mortals.

1007
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:11,950
你可能不是凡人 但我
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...

1008
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:13,050
不 彼得
No, Peter...

1009
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:15,670
只要这颗星球内的光不熄
death will remain a stranger to both of us

1010
01:20:15,670 --> 01:20:18,050
我们就都不用面对死亡
as long as the light burns within the planet.

1011
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:19,880
我可以永生不死
I'm immortal?

1012
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:23,160
真的吗
Really?

1013
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,260
对 只要光还在
Yes! As long as the light exists.

1014
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:30,940
我可以用那光建造很酷的东西 就像
And I can use the light to build cool things like

1015
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:32,780
你当初建造这颗星球那样
how you made this whole planet?

1016
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:35,350
你可能要花几百万年时间去练习
It might take you a few million years of practice

1017
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:37,700
才能得心应手 但 没错
before you get really good at it. But, yes!

1018
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:39,430
什么 这太
What! This is...

1019
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:42,300
准备见识一个八百英尺的吃豆人雕像吧
Well, get ready for an 800-foot statue of Pac-Man

1020
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,130
旁边还有骷髅王[动画形象]和希瑟·拉克里尔[女星]
with Skeletor and Heather Locklear.

1021
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:44,830
你想干什么都行
You can do anything you want.

1022
01:20:44,830 --> 01:20:46,980
我要做一些奇怪的东西
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

1023
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:50,230
但是 彼得 这是巨大的责任
But you know, Peter, it is a tremendous responsibility.

1024
01:20:50,230 --> 01:20:52,950
只有我们能重塑宇宙
Only we can remake the universe.

1025
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:55,920
只有我们能牵着宇宙的缰绳
Only we can take the bridle of the cosmos

1026
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,060
领导它走向正确的方向
and lead it to where it needs to go.

1027
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:00,520
怎么做
How?

1028
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:12,130
跟我来
Come with me.

1029
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,450
德拉克斯 德拉克斯
Drax, Drax. Drax!

1030
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:26,300
德拉克斯 我们得谈谈
Drax! We need to talk.

1031
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,550
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1032
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:32,590
但我喜欢稍微有点肉的女人
But I like a woman with some meat on her bones.

1033
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:33,640
什么
What?

1034
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:35,180
我说我觉得你恶心
I tried to let you down easily

1035
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:37,230
就是不想让你太伤心
by telling you I found you disgusting.

1036
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:38,840
不 我不是想…
No, that's not what I...

1037
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,400
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1038
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:46,650
我在想象跟你有肌肤之亲
I'm imagining being with you physically.

1039
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:48,290
德拉克斯 我不是想
Drax... That's not...

1040
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:49,860
我对你不是那种喜欢
I don't like you like that.

1041
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:52,470
我都不喜欢你这个物种
I don't even like the type of thing you are.

1042
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:54,650
没必要人身攻击
There's no need to get personal.

1043
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:57,800
听着 伊戈得到了他想要的
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted.

1044
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,220
我应该早点告诉你的
I should have told you earlier.

1045
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:00,600
我真傻
I'm stupid.

1046
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:02,720
你们有危险了
You are in danger.

1047
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:09,960
那是什么
What is that?

1048
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:16,910
你得重新调整你看待生命的方式
Now, you need to readjust the way you process life.

1049
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:19,940
我们身边的一切 包括那个姑娘
Everything around us, including the girl...

1050
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:23,410
一切都是暂时的
Everything is temporary.

1051
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:26,240
我们才是永恒
We are forever.

1052
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:28,040
永恒不会无聊吗
Doesn't eternity get boring?

1053
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,170
如果你有目标就不会 彼得
Not if you have a purpose, Peter,

1054
01:22:30,170 --> 01:22:32,530
你来这儿就是为了那个目标
which is why you're here.

1055
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:35,240
我告诉过你 很多年前
I told you how all those years ago

1056
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:39,260
我有一股不灭的冲动 想找到生命
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.

1057
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,750
但我没告诉你的是
But what I did not tell you was how,

1058
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:43,550
当我终于找到它的时候
when I finally did find it...

1059
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:45,750
它是那么的
it was all so...

1060
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,260
令人失望
disappointing.

1061
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:53,030
那时我才
And that is when I came...

1062
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:57,860
深深地顿悟了
to a profound realization.

1063
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:03,230
我内心寻找其他生命的渴望
My innate desire to seek out other life

1064
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:07,960
不是为了让我能游走于那生命之间
was not so that I could walk among that life.

1065
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,020
彼得
Peter...

1066
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:15,340
我找到了意义
I have found meaning.

1067
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,470
我看见了
I see it.

1068
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:40,630
永恒
Eternity!

1069
01:23:41,290 --> 01:23:42,640
天啊
Oh, my God.

1070
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:55,230
我们得离开这颗星球
We need to get off this planet.

1071
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,060
天啊
Oh, man.

1072
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:13,010
总之 我被粗鲁地打断之前我正在说…
Anyway, before I was so rudely interrupted...

1073
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:16,220
那时 我是个联邦快递的快递员
At that time, I was a Federal Express man.

1074
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:29,240
你干什么呢 小子
What the hell you doing, boy?

1075
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,080
从你说到他时的样子我看得出
I could tell by how you talked about him

1076
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,790
这个伊戈不是好人
this Ego is bad news.

1077
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:34,650
我们得来救奎尔
We're here to save Quill.

1078
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:36,060
为了什么
For what?

1079
01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:38,070
荣誉吗
For honor?

1080
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,040
爱吗
For love?

1081
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,570
不 我才不在乎那些
No. I don't care about those things.

1082
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:44,500
我想救奎尔 好证明我比他强
I wanna save Quill so I can prove I'm better than him!

1083
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:47,650
我能拿这事压他一辈子
I can lord this over him forever.

1084
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:50,850
你笑我做什么
What are you laughing at me for?

1085
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:56,030
你可以骗自己和其他所有人 但你骗不了我
You can fool yourself and everyone else, but you can't fool me.

1086
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:57,820
我了解你
I know who you are.

1087
01:24:57,830 --> 01:25:00,260
你才不了解我呢 废物
You don't know anything about me, loser.

1088
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:02,600
我了解你的一切
I know everything about you.

1089
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:05,580
我知道你假装是最坏最狠的人
I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest,

1090
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:07,440
但你其实最害怕
but, actually, you're the most scared of all.

1091
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:07,940
闭嘴
Shut up!

1092
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:10,640
我知道你偷你用不着的电池
I know you steal batteries you don't need

1093
01:25:10,650 --> 01:25:13,050
你推开每一个愿意忍受你的人
and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you

1094
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:14,810
因为哪怕一点点爱
because just a little bit of love

1095
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:18,530
也会提醒你 你内心的空虚多大多深
reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is.

1096
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:19,470
我叫你闭嘴了
I said shut up!

1097
01:25:19,470 --> 01:25:21,450
我知道那些制造了你的科学家
I know them scientists what made you,

1098
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,460
根本没在乎过你
never gave a rat's ass about you.

1099
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:24,320
我说真的 哥们
I'm serious, dude!

1100
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:27,780
就像我自己的父母 他们把我
Just like my own damn parents who sold me

1101
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:30,230
他们的亲生儿子 卖去做奴隶
their own little baby, into slavery.

1102
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:32,760
我知道你是什么人 小子
I know who you are, boy.

1103
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,660
因为你是我
Because you're me.

1104
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,330
我们是一对儿什么样的人啊
What kind of a pair are we?

1105
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:47,670
大概是一对儿要去对付一颗星球的人吧
The kind that's about to go fight a planet, I reckon.

1106
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:50,270
好啊 好嘞 很好
All right, okay! Good.

1107
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,340
等等
Wait.

1108
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:52,580
对付什么
Fight a what?

1109
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:58,180
你们是什么人
Who are you people?

1110
01:25:58,180 --> 01:25:58,930
这地方是什么
What is this place?

1111
01:25:58,930 --> 01:26:00,500
卡魔拉 放了她
Gamora, let her go!

1112
01:26:00,630 --> 01:26:03,060
洞里的尸体 他们是谁
The bodies in the caverns... Who are they?

1113
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:05,140
你在害怕
You are scared.

1114
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:11,540
我称之为扩张
I call it the Expansion.

1115
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:14,280
这是我的目标
It is my purpose

1116
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:15,400
现在
and now

1117
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:19,590
它也是你的目标了
it is yours as well.

1118
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:21,960
好美啊
It's beautiful.

1119
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,360
数千年来
Over thousands of years,

1120
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:29,000
我将数千个我的延伸根植在了
I implanted thousands of extensions of myself

1121
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,530
数千个世界上
on thousands of worlds.

1122
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:35,780
我得实现生命唯一真正的目标
I need to fulfill life's one true purpose...

1123
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:37,940
生长 传播
To grow and spread

1124
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:41,160
覆盖一切存在
covering all that exists

1125
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:45,430
直到一切都
until everything is...

1126
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:47,580
变成我
Me!

1127
01:26:48,290 --> 01:26:49,840
她对我做了什么
What did she do to me?

1128
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:52,410
她已经把一切都告诉我了
She already told me everything.

1129
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:54,970
我只有一个问题
I only had one problem.

1130
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:57,440
一个天神
A single Celestial

1131
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,270
是没有足够能量完成这样的伟业的
doesn't have enough power for such an enterprise.

1132
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:03,250
但两个天神
But two Celestials...

1133
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:06,640
那或许就可以了
Well, now, that just might do.

1134
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:10,650
那些尸体
The bodies...

1135
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:12,970
都是他的孩子
are his children.

1136
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,130
我所做的一切中
Out of all my labors

1137
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,250
我最喜欢的
the most beguiling

1138
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:21,550
就是尝试将我的DNA嫁接到其他物种上
was attempting to graft my DNA with that of another species.

1139
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:24,130
我原本希望这样的配对
I hoped the result of such a coupling

1140
01:27:24,130 --> 01:27:26,710
足以为扩张提供能量
would be enough to power the Expansion.

1141
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:30,410
我让勇度把一些后代送来给我
I had Yondu deliver some of them to me.

1142
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:32,040
这有违掠夺者的准则
It broke the Ravager code,

1143
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:35,300
但我慷慨地赔偿了他
but I compensated him generously and

1144
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:37,830
而且为安抚他的良心 我说我绝不会伤害他们
to ease his conscience, I said I'd never hurt them.

1145
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,510
这倒不假 他们都毫无感觉
I mean, that was true. They never felt a thing.

1146
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:43,460
但他们一个个都让我失望了
But one after the other, they failed me.

1147
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:47,260
没有一个携带了天神基因
Not one of them carried the Celestial genes.

1148
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:49,290
直到你 彼得
Until you, Peter.

1149
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,640
我所有的后裔里
Out of all my spawn,

1150
01:27:53,230 --> 01:27:57,410
只有你继承了与光的联系
only you carried the connection to the light.

1151
01:27:57,610 --> 01:28:00,500
我们得马上找到彼得 离开这个破星球
We need to find Peter now, and get off this damn planet.

1152
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:03,180
伊戈现在肯定已经拉拢了他
Ego will have won him to his side by now.

1153
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:04,880
- 他有办法…  - 那我们直接走吧
- He has a way of...  - Then we just go.

1154
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:05,860
不行
No!

1155
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:06,980
他是我们的朋友
He's our friend.

1156
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:09,420
你们就成天冲彼此大吼
All any of you do is yell at each other.

1157
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:10,600
你们才不是朋友
You are not friends.

1158
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:11,670
你是对的
You're right.

1159
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:13,920
我们是家人
We're family.

1160
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,010
我们不丢下任何人
We leave no one behind.

1161
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:21,740
或许除了你
Except maybe you.

1162
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:23,920
天呐
Oh, my God.

1163
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,400
我存在以来首次
For the first time in my existence,

1164
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:29,760
真正不再孤单了
I am truly not alone!

1165
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,550
怎么了 儿子
What is it, son?

1166
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:41,130
我的朋友们
My friends.

1167
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:46,480
你瞧 这就是你人性的一面 彼得
You see, that's the mortal in you, Peter.

1168
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:47,970
是啊
Yes.

1169
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:50,860
我们超越了那些东西
We are beyond such things.

1170
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:51,890
是啊
Yes.

1171
01:28:54,610 --> 01:28:56,140
- 好了…  - 但我母亲…
- Now...  - But my mother...

1172
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,920
你说你爱我母亲的
You said you loved my mother.

1173
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,670
我是爱她
And that I did.

1174
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,540
我的水百合
My river lily who knew

1175
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:08,940
她会唱收音机里播放的每一首歌
all the words to every song that came over the radio.

1176
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:13,370
我三次回到地球看她
I returned to Earth to see her three times.

1177
01:29:13,370 --> 01:29:15,750
我知道 如果我再第四次回去
And I knew if I returned a fourth...

1178
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:17,550
我就再不会走了
I'd never leave.

1179
01:29:18,910 --> 01:29:20,060
扩张
The Expansion...

1180
01:29:22,010 --> 01:29:24,280
我存在的目的 就完了
the reason for my very existence, would be over.

1181
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:25,850
所以我做了我必须做的
So, I did what I had to do.

1182
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:27,760
但是
But

1183
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:32,420
让她患上脑瘤简直伤透了我的心
it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head.

1184
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:38,060
什么
What?

1185
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:39,130
好吧
Now, all right...

1186
01:29:39,130 --> 01:29:42,180
我知道这听上去很不好
I know that sounds bad.

1187
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:53,080
你
Who

1188
01:29:53,710 --> 01:29:57,170
以为你是谁啊
in the hell do you think you are?

1189
01:29:57,170 --> 01:29:59,090
你杀了我母亲
You killed my mother!

1190
01:29:59,090 --> 01:30:00,380
我
I tried...

1191
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:02,060
那么努力
so hard...

1192
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:06,010
找到最适合你的形态
to find the form that best suited you...

1193
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:09,200
这就是你的感谢吗
and this is the thanks I get?

1194
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:12,660
你真得长大了
You really need to grow up.

1195
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:18,870
我本想跟你一起做的
I wanted to do this together...

1196
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:21,070
但看来你只能
but I suppose you'll have to learn

1197
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:24,500
做个一千年的电池 慢慢长进了
by spending the next thousand years as a battery!

1198
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:28,490
可算 火箭
Finally! Rocket?

1199
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:31,190
把发射器带在身边 我好找你
Keep that transmitter nearby, so I can find you.

1200
01:30:31,190 --> 01:30:33,250
我们在一件旧施工设备里
We're in an old piece of construction equipment

1201
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:36,380
勇度曾用它来切开艾斯克维拉银行
Yondu once used to slice open the Bank of A'askavaria.

1202
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:37,370
伊戈是个疯子
Ego's unhinged.

1203
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:38,790
我知道 准备好
I know. Get ready.

1204
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:40,200
放 克拉林
Drop her, Kraglin.

1205
01:30:58,650 --> 01:30:59,890
不
No.

1206
01:31:11,110 --> 01:31:14,130
我的生命 我的爱
My life, my love.

1207
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:16,560
我的女人是大海
My lady is the sea

1208
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:19,420
彼得
Peter...

1209
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:22,710
这就是那海
this is the sea.

1210
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:07,620
你好啊 混蛋
Hey, there, jackass!

1211
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:19,240
那是什么玩意
What is that thing?

1212
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:29,050
闪开 小笨格鲁特
Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!

1213
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:35,990
我就说有点不对劲
I told you something didn't feel right.

1214
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:38,650
“我早说过”我现在正需要听这种话
"I told you so." Just what I need to hear right now.

1215
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:40,230
我不是回来了吗
Well, I came back, didn't I?

1216
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:42,420
因为我们有心照不宣的情愫
Because there's an unspoken thing.

1217
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:44,640
才没有什么心照不宣的情愫
There is no unspoken thing.

1218
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:47,060
你干什么呢 你差点害死我们
What are you doing? You could've killed us all!

1219
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:48,850
“谢谢 火箭”
"Thank you, Rocket"?

1220
01:32:48,850 --> 01:32:50,230
我们都控制局面了
We had it under control.

1221
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:53,920
我们没有 那只是他真身的延伸
We did not. That is only an extension of his true self.

1222
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,200
他很快就会回来的
He will be back soon.

1223
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,270
蓝妹妹怎么在这儿
What's Smurfette doing here?

1224
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:58,360
我只想搭车回家
Whatever I need to do to get a damn ride home.

1225
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:00,000
她还想杀我
She tried to murder me!

1226
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
我救了你 你个蠢狐狸
I saved you, you stupid fox!

1227
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,470
他不是狐狸
He's not a fox.

1228
01:33:03,470 --> 01:33:05,550
- 我是格鲁特  - 我也不是浣兔
- I am Groot.  - I'm not a raboon, either.

1229
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:06,830
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1230
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:08,600
是“浣熊” 算了
"Raccoon." Whatever.

1231
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:13,380
怎么杀一个天神啊
How do we kill a Celestial?

1232
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:14,790
他有个核
There's a center to him.

1233
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,170
他的大脑还是灵魂什么的
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...

1234
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:18,860
有个保护壳
Some sort of protective shell.

1235
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:21,440
在地表下的洞穴里
It's in the caverns below the surface.

1236
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:24,710
勇度
Yondu?

1237
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:35,380
推进器失去动力了
Thrusters are out.

1238
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:37,280
看来我该庆幸我长得瘦
Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid.

1239
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:39,540
否则你就会把我交给这个疯子了
Otherwise, you'd have delivered me to this maniac.

1240
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:42,080
你还以为那是我留下了你的原因吗 白痴
You still reckon that's the reason I kept you around, you idiot?

1241
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,140
是你这么跟我说的 你个老笨蛋
That's what you told me, you old doofus.

1242
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:46,400
我搞明白了其他孩子的下场后
Once I figured out what happened to them other kids

1243
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,120
我当然不能把你交出去
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.

1244
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,080
你说你要吃了我
You said you were gonna eat me.

1245
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,850
那是玩笑话
That was being funny!

1246
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:53,450
我可没想笑
Not to me!

1247
01:33:53,450 --> 01:33:55,030
你们真有毛病
You people have issues.

1248
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:57,150
我当然有毛病
Of course I have issues.

1249
01:33:57,550 --> 01:34:00,060
那可是我老爸
That's my freakin' father!

1250
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:02,140
推进器恢复了
Thrusters are back up.

1251
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:18,000
- 我们该向上飞  - 不行
- We should be going up!  - We can't!

1252
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
伊戈想毁掉我们所知的宇宙
Ego wants to eradicate the universe as we know it.

1253
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,170
我们得杀了他
We have to kill him.

1254
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:23,090
火箭
Rocket!

1255
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:23,970
好嘞
Got it!

1256
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:40,050
那我们又要拯救银河系了
So, we're saving the galaxy again?

1257
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:41,130
大概是吧
I guess.

1258
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:42,300
太棒了
Awesome!

1259
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:46,620
如果我们救了两次银河系
We're really gonna be able to jack up our prices

1260
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:48,550
就能坐地起价了
if we're two-time galaxy savers.

1261
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:51,270
我真不敢相信你居然想到了这个
I seriously can't believe that's where your mind goes.

1262
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:54,130
就是想想嘛 哥们 我们不是朋友嘛
It was just a random thought, man. I thought we were friends.

1263
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:56,630
我当然在乎那些星球啊 建筑啊
Of course, I care about the planets, and the buildings

1264
01:34:56,630 --> 01:34:58,750
和各个星球上的动物啊
and all the animals on the planets.

1265
01:34:58,750 --> 01:35:00,050
还有人呢
And the people.

1266
01:35:01,230 --> 01:35:05,650
那个坏脾气狗狗好可爱 他让我想死
The crabby puppy is so cute. He makes me wanna die!

1267
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:44,660
飞行员
Pilots...

1268
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:46,420
释放先遣队
release envoy units.

1269
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:51,990
我们的传感器感应到电池在星球地表下
Our sensors detect the batteries are below the surface of the planet.

1270
01:35:54,190 --> 01:35:55,190
下潜
Dive!

1271
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:13,950
船长
Captain?

1272
01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:15,240
船长
Captain?

1273
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:22,980
伊戈为什么找你来
Tell me why Ego wants you here?

1274
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,280
他需要我跟光的基因联系
He needs my genetic connection to the light

1275
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,070
来帮他毁灭宇宙
to help destroy the universe.

1276
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:29,280
他还想教我控制能量
He tried to teach me how to control the power.

1277
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:30,590
你能控制吗
So, could you?

1278
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:31,830
稍稍能吧
A little.

1279
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:33,330
我做了个能量球
I made a ball.

1280
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:34,730
球
A ball?

1281
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:36,700
我已经拼命去想了
I thought as hard as I could.

1282
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:38,310
我只能弄出来个那个
It was all that I could come up with.

1283
01:36:38,310 --> 01:36:39,390
你“想”
You "thought"?

1284
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:41,460
你以为我控制这支箭飞的时候
You think when I make this arrow fly

1285
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:42,930
是用的脑袋吗
I use my head?

1286
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:06,620
那儿
There.

1287
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:08,330
那就是伊戈的核
That's Ego's core.

1288
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:12,690
外壳很厚 火箭
That ore is thick, Rocket.

1289
01:37:12,730 --> 01:37:14,080
交给我吧
I got it covered.

1290
01:37:20,450 --> 01:37:21,820
我们必须快点
We must hurry.

1291
01:37:21,890 --> 01:37:24,440
伊戈很快就会找到我们
It will not take Ego long to find us.

1292
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:29,730
稳住
Keep it steady.

1293
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:38,400
钻透到核 然后杀死他
We drill into the center, we kill him!

1294
01:37:45,330 --> 01:37:46,250
船长
Captain?

1295
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:47,620
怎么了 克拉林
What is it, Kraglin?

1296
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,020
还记得阿耶莎那妞儿吗
Remember that Ayesha chick?

1297
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:51,120
记得 怎么了
Yeah, why?

1298
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:52,890
该死
Oh, hell!

1299
01:38:14,150 --> 01:38:15,990
你为什么不开激光炮
Why aren't you firing the lasers?

1300
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:17,900
他们炸掉了发电机
They blew out the generator.

1301
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:20,250
我记得我带了一个小引爆器
I think I packed a small detonator.

1302
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:22,470
有引爆器没炸药也没用
A detonator is worthless without explosives.

1303
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,200
我们有这些
Well, we got these.

1304
01:38:24,710 --> 01:38:26,830
这玩意的破坏性能杀死伊戈吗
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?

1305
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:29,010
如果能的话 会造成他整个
If it is, it'll cause a chain reaction

1306
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:30,870
神经系统的连锁反应
throughout his entire nervous system.

1307
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:31,660
意思是
Meaning what?

1308
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:33,680
整颗星球都会爆炸
The entire planet will explode.

1309
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,610
我们得快点逃出去
We'll have to get out of here fast.

1310
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:37,090
我装了个定时器
I rigged a timer.

1311
01:38:37,910 --> 01:38:38,710
走
Go!

1312
01:38:52,970 --> 01:38:54,690
他要来了
He's coming.

1313
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:58,150
你不是说你能让他睡着吗
Didn't you say you could make him sleep?

1314
01:38:58,510 --> 01:39:01,130
在他想睡的时候 他太强大了
When he wants. He's too powerful.

1315
01:39:01,130 --> 01:39:02,400
我做不到
I can't!

1316
01:39:02,930 --> 01:39:04,780
你不用相信自己
You don't have to believe in yourself

1317
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:07,440
因为我相信你
because I believe in you.

1318
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:21,110
睡吧
Sleep!

1319
01:39:28,110 --> 01:39:29,890
我没想到她能做到
I never thought she'd be able to do it

1320
01:39:30,070 --> 01:39:32,310
毕竟她一副很瘦弱的样子
with as weak and skinny as she appears to be.

1321
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:35,750
我不知道我能拖住他多久
I don't know how long I can hold him.

1322
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:40,880
金属太厚了
The metal's too thick.

1323
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,000
要让炸弹达到目的
For the bomb to work,

1324
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,910
我们得把它放在伊戈的核上
we'd actually need to place it on Ego's core.

1325
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:47,860
我们的大屁股钻不进这些小洞里
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit through those tiny holes.

1326
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:49,120
那么
Well...

1327
01:39:51,630 --> 01:39:53,190
这主意糟透了
That's a terrible idea.

1328
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:55,810
我们就剩这一个主意了
Which is the only kind of idea we have left.

1329
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:58,200
难以置信
Unbelievable.

1330
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:01,250
“火箭 做这个 火箭 做那个”
"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."

1331
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:03,470
今天真够受的
What a day.

1332
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:14,770
好了 首先你打开这个开关 再打开这个
All right, first you flick this switch, then this switch.

1333
01:40:14,770 --> 01:40:16,300
这样就启动了
That activates it.

1334
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:18,570
接着你按下这个按钮
Then you push this button

1335
01:40:18,580 --> 01:40:21,330
让你有五分钟时间逃跑
which will give you five minutes to get out of there.

1336
01:40:21,710 --> 01:40:23,350
不管你做什么
Now, whatever you do

1337
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:25,930
千万别按这个按钮
don't push this button

1338
01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:28,160
因为那样会立即引爆炸弹
because that will set off the bomb immediately

1339
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,710
我们就都没命了
and we'll all be dead.

1340
01:40:29,710 --> 01:40:32,330
重复一遍我刚才说的
Now, repeat back what I just said.

1341
01:40:32,660 --> 01:40:34,080
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1342
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,590
- 我是格鲁特  - 对了
- I am Groot.  - That's right.

1343
01:40:36,590 --> 01:40:38,190
- 我是格鲁特  - 不
- I am Groot.  - No!

1344
01:40:38,190 --> 01:40:40,520
不对 这个按钮会杀死所有人
No, that's the button that will kill everyone!

1345
01:40:40,930 --> 01:40:41,980
再来
Try again.

1346
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:45,860
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1347
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:47,920
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1348
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:49,860
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1349
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:51,820
不 你刚才就是这么错的
No! That's exactly what you just said!

1350
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:53,670
这怎么可能
How is that even possible?

1351
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:55,710
你应该按哪个按钮
Which button is the button you're supposed to push?

1352
01:40:55,710 --> 01:40:56,800
指一下
Point to it.

1353
01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:58,830
不对
No!

1354
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:00,470
你让他紧张了
You're making him nervous!

1355
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:02,370
闭嘴 给我拿点胶带来
Shut up and get me some tape!

1356
01:41:02,370 --> 01:41:04,020
外面有人有胶带吗
Does anybody have any tape out there?

1357
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:05,790
我要把死亡按钮贴上胶带
I wanna put some tape over the death button.

1358
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:08,120
我没胶带 我去问问
I don't have any tape. Let me check.

1359
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:11,390
勇度 你有…
Yo, Yondu... do you have...

1360
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,930
你有胶带吗
Do you have any tape?

1361
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,800
卡魔拉 你有胶带吗
Gamora? Do you have any tape?

1362
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:20,330
胶带
Tape!

1363
01:41:20,810 --> 01:41:21,930
算了
Never mind.

1364
01:41:23,870 --> 01:41:26,590
德拉克斯 你有胶带吗
Drax, do you have any tape?

1365
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:29,150
对 透明胶也行
Yes, scotch tape would work.

1366
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:31,740
既然你没有 为什么还要问我
Then why did you ask me if scotch tape would work,

1367
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:33,010
透明胶行不行
if you don't have any?

1368
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:35,520
没人有胶带
Nobody has any tape!

1369
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,630
谁都没有胶带吗
Not a single person has tape?

1370
01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:38,230
没有
Nope!

1371
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:39,940
你问过星云了吗
Did you ask Nebula?

1372
01:41:40,710 --> 01:41:41,400
问过了
Yes!

1373
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:42,600
你确定吗
Are you sure?

1374
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:43,950
我问勇度的时候
I asked Yondu...

1375
01:41:43,950 --> 01:41:46,670
- 她就坐在他旁边  - 我就知道你撒谎
- and she was sitting next to him.  - I knew you were lying!

1376
01:41:46,670 --> 01:41:49,580
你包里装着价值连城的电池还有一枚原子弹
You have priceless batteries and an atomic bomb in your bag.

1377
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:51,340
要说谁会带胶带 就是你了
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!

1378
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:55,030
我就想说这个 什么事都得我做
That's exactly my point! I have to do everything!

1379
01:41:55,030 --> 01:41:57,390
你浪费了多少时间
You are wasting a lot of time here!

1380
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:05,510
我们都要死了
We're all gonna die.

1381
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:09,890
后推进器又坏了
Rear thrusters are out again!

1382
01:42:09,890 --> 01:42:12,460
没那个发电机我们死定了
We're done for without that generator!

1383
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:27,360
银河护卫队
Guardians...

1384
01:42:28,110 --> 01:42:30,220
也许这对你们会是个安慰
perhaps it will provide you solace

1385
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:32,840
你们的死 不会毫无意义
that your deaths are not without purpose.

1386
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:34,700
而是会警告那些
They will serve as a warning

1387
01:42:34,710 --> 01:42:37,180
想要背叛我们的人
to all of those tempted with betraying us.

1388
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:40,670
别想耍索维林族
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

1389
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:45,740
会很疼的
This is gonna hurt.

1390
01:42:45,740 --> 01:42:47,300
光说不练
Promises, promises.

1391
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:10,940
不
No!

1392
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:15,530
不不不
No! No! No!

1393
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:20,380
要爆炸了
We're gonna blow!

1394
01:43:25,690 --> 01:43:28,030
彼得 不
Peter! No!

1395
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:48,340
怎么了
What?

1396
01:43:48,970 --> 01:43:50,700
你活像玛丽·波平斯
You look like Mary Poppins.

1397
01:43:51,110 --> 01:43:52,290
他酷吗
Is he cool?

1398
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:55,490
当然 他很酷
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

1399
01:43:56,550 --> 01:43:58,370
我是玛丽·波平斯哦
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

1400
01:44:25,870 --> 01:44:27,540
螳螂 小心
Mantis, look out!

1401
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:41,300
她只是昏过去了
She's just unconscious.

1402
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:59,010
炸弹还有多久炸
How long until the bomb goes off?

1403
01:44:59,010 --> 01:45:01,760
万一万一格鲁特没把我们都炸死
In the unlikely event that Groot doesn't kill us all...

1404
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:03,290
那还有六分钟
about six minutes.

1405
01:45:07,930 --> 01:45:10,690
克拉林 我们需要飞行舱来带我们撤离
Kraglin, we need the quadrant for an extraction.

1406
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:11,470
倒计时五分钟
T-minus five minutes.

1407
01:45:11,470 --> 01:45:12,540
是 船长
Aye, Captain.

1408
01:45:16,610 --> 01:45:19,480
克拉林到时 上面得有人接应
Somebody's gotta be up top when Kraglin arrives.

1409
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,790
德拉克斯 带螳螂走
Drax, take Mantis.

1410
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:25,730
我的乳头
My nipples!

1411
01:45:33,630 --> 01:45:34,810
卡魔拉
Gamora!

1412
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:40,060
彼得
Peter!

1413
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:07,500
别想多了
Get over it.

1414
01:46:07,670 --> 01:46:11,500
得了 彼得 我知道你并不想这样
Come now, Peter. I know this isn't what you want.

1415
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:18,450
我让你做出这样的选择 还算什么父亲啊
What kind of father would I be to let you make this choice?

1416
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:49,060
帅气
Yeah!

1417
01:46:50,110 --> 01:46:54,010
很快 彼得 我们就将成为一切
Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.

1418
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:57,860
别再惹我生气了
So stop pissing me off!

1419
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,680
我们得上去撤离点
We have to get up to the extraction point!

1420
01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:28,140
冲
Go!

1421
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:29,170
我说过
I told you...

1422
01:49:29,410 --> 01:49:32,830
我不想一个人做
I don't want to do this alone.

1423
01:49:36,490 --> 01:49:38,140
你不能拒绝
You cannot deny

1424
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:42,180
宇宙赋予你的人生目的
the purpose the universe has bestowed upon you.

1425
01:49:51,050 --> 01:49:53,400
大家不要靠近
Everyone, I need you to stay back!

1426
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:54,660
那是什么
What is that?

1427
01:50:09,970 --> 01:50:12,290
不非得如此的 彼得
It doesn't need to be like this, Peter.

1428
01:50:13,790 --> 01:50:16,840
你为什么要毁掉我们的机会
Why are you destroying our chance?

1429
01:50:19,930 --> 01:50:22,880
别再否认自己的身份了
Stop pretending you aren't what you are.

1430
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:26,570
你是上亿
One in billions.

1431
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:29,640
上兆 甚至更多中的唯一
Trillions. Even more.

1432
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:36,590
生命怎么可能有更伟大的意义
What greater meaning can life possibly have to offer?

1433
01:50:39,020 --> 01:50:43,110
我不是用脑袋控制箭的 孩子
I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy!

1434
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:45,720
我是用心
I use my heart...

1435
01:51:20,690 --> 01:51:24,490
你不该杀了我妈妈 还捏碎我的随身听
You shouldn't have killed my mom, and squished my Walkman.

1436
01:52:04,860 --> 01:52:07,880
格鲁特 如果你听得到 快点
Groot? If you can hear me, hurry up!

1437
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:11,130
我不确定奎尔还能分散他注意力多久
I'm not sure how long Quill can keep him distracted!

1438
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:12,650
格鲁特 快点
Groot, hurry!

1439
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:11,140
勇度 我们要炸了
Yondu, we're about to blow!

1440
01:53:11,140 --> 01:53:12,550
上船
Get to the ship!

1441
01:53:12,730 --> 01:53:14,020
不能丢下奎尔
Not without Quill!

1442
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:16,250
你还得照顾小树枝
You need to take care of the twig!

1443
01:53:17,420 --> 01:53:19,140
不能丢下你
Not without you!

1444
01:53:20,380 --> 01:53:23,520
我这辈子都没做过几件好事 耗子
I ain't done nothin' right my whole damn life, rat.

1445
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:28,770
让我做这件吧
You need to give me this.

1446
01:53:39,490 --> 01:53:41,680
一套太空服和一个飞行装置
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

1447
01:53:42,090 --> 01:53:43,690
我一样只有一个
I only have one of each.

1448
01:53:56,590 --> 01:53:58,510
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1449
01:53:59,010 --> 01:54:00,110
他说什么
What's that?

1450
01:54:01,860 --> 01:54:06,110
他说“欢迎加入他娘的银河护卫队”
He says, "Welcome to the frickin' Guardians of the Galaxy."

1451
01:54:06,580 --> 01:54:08,690
而且他用的词不是“他娘的”
Only he didn't use "Frickin'."

1452
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:16,290
再见 小树枝
Bye, twig.

1453
01:54:18,190 --> 01:54:21,150
我们回头得好好谈谈你说粗话的问题
We're gonna need to have a real discussion about your language.

1454
01:55:16,490 --> 01:55:17,470
彼得呢
Where's Peter?

1455
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:19,710
火箭 他在哪
Rocket, where is he?

1456
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:21,900
火箭
Rocket.

1457
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:23,840
火箭 看着我 他在哪
Rocket, look at me! Where is he?

1458
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:32,590
不 我不能丢下他
No. I'm not leaving without him.

1459
01:55:39,510 --> 01:55:40,580
对不起
I'm sorry.

1460
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:43,710
我今天只能承受失去一个朋友
I can only afford to lose one friend today.

1461
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:46,240
克拉林 走
Kraglin, go!

1462
01:55:46,350 --> 01:55:47,160
等等
Wait...

1463
01:55:48,270 --> 01:55:49,310
奎尔回来了吗
Is Quill back?

1464
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:53,400
火箭 奎尔呢
Rocket, where's Quill?

1465
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:57,750
火箭 奎尔呢
Rocket, where's Quill?

1466
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:00,230
火箭
Rocket!

1467
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:03,380
奎尔呢
Where's Quill?

1468
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:06,400
奎尔呢
Where's Quill?

1469
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:16,520
不 我们得阻止它
No, we need to stop it.

1470
01:56:16,530 --> 01:56:18,010
我们得阻止它
We need to stop it.

1471
01:56:21,260 --> 01:56:23,180
不 停下
No. Stop.

1472
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:25,790
停下 听着 听我说
Stop. Listen. Listen to me!

1473
01:56:25,990 --> 01:56:27,530
你是个神
You are a god.

1474
01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:29,890
如果你杀了我
If you kill me...

1475
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:32,790
你就跟其他人一样了
you'll be just like everybody else.

1476
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:35,890
那有什么不好
What's so wrong with that?

1477
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:37,240
不
No!

1478
01:57:27,490 --> 01:57:31,330
他或许是你生父 孩子 但他可不是你爸爸
He may have been your father, boy, but he wasn't your daddy.

1479
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:37,850
真抱歉我一件事都没做对
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

1480
01:57:38,950 --> 01:57:40,850
你是我的孩子我太走运了
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

1481
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:45,880
什么
What?

1482
01:57:58,280 --> 01:57:59,610
勇度 你干什么
Yondu, what are you doing?

1483
01:57:59,740 --> 01:58:00,700
不行
You can't.

1484
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:03,470
勇度
Yondu!

1485
01:58:08,710 --> 01:58:09,550
不
No!

1486
01:58:10,290 --> 01:58:11,070
不
No!

1487
01:58:14,950 --> 01:58:15,910
不
No!

1488
01:58:19,150 --> 01:58:21,810
不不
No! No!

1489
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:24,540
不要
No!

1490
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:20,650
我告诉卡魔拉
I told Gamora

1491
01:59:20,650 --> 01:59:21,760
我小时候
how when I was a kid

1492
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:24,830
会假装大卫·霍索夫是我爸爸
I used to pretend David Hasselhoff was my dad.

1493
01:59:26,850 --> 01:59:29,890
他是地球的一个歌手演员 很出名
He's a singer and actor from Earth, really famous guy.

1494
01:59:31,770 --> 01:59:33,310
刚刚 我突然想到
Earlier, it struck me...

1495
01:59:34,550 --> 01:59:38,860
勇度没有会说话的车 但他有会飞的箭
Yondu didn't have a talking car, but he did have a flying arrow.

1496
01:59:39,540 --> 01:59:41,620
他没有天使般美丽的歌喉
He didn't have the beautiful voice of an angel

1497
01:59:41,630 --> 01:59:43,730
但他的哨声有如天籁
but he did have the whistle of one.

1498
01:59:44,270 --> 01:59:47,870
勇度和大卫·霍索夫都会经历牛逼的冒险
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff went on kick-ass adventures

1499
01:59:47,870 --> 01:59:49,590
勾搭性感的女人
and hooked up with hot women

1500
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:52,220
还打机器人
and fought robots.

1501
01:59:55,170 --> 01:59:58,580
看来大卫·霍索夫终究成为了我爸爸
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind of end up being my dad after all.

1502
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:01,250
但其实那是你 勇度
Only it was you, Yondu.

1503
02:00:07,170 --> 02:00:08,560
我有个很酷的爸爸
I had a pretty cool dad.

1504
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:13,750
我想说的是
What I'm trying to say here is...

1505
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:20,370
有时候你寻找了一生的东西
sometimes that thing you're searching for your whole life

1506
02:00:22,770 --> 02:00:24,700
其实一直在你身边
it's right there by your side all along.

1507
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:26,610
你却不自知
You don't even know it.

1508
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:40,450
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1509
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:43,590
他是喊你小树枝
He did call you twig.

1510
02:00:46,150 --> 02:00:47,170
星云
Nebula...

1511
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:54,060
我跟你一样只是个孩子
I was a child like you.

1512
02:00:55,390 --> 02:00:59,240
我每天只想着活到第二天
I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day.

1513
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:01,990
我从未想过灭霸对你做了什么
And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you.

1514
02:01:02,770 --> 02:01:04,110
我想弥补
I'm trying to make it right.

1515
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:07,370
整个宇宙中还有其他你这样的小女孩
There are little girls like you across the universe

1516
02:01:07,380 --> 02:01:08,910
她们有危险
who are in danger.

1517
02:01:11,260 --> 02:01:13,130
你可以留下 跟我们一起帮助她们
You can stay with us and help them.

1518
02:01:13,910 --> 02:01:16,170
我杀了灭霸就能帮助她们
I will help them by killing Thanos.

1519
02:01:16,470 --> 02:01:17,960
我不知道那是否能做到
I don't know if that's possible.

1520
02:01:33,310 --> 02:01:35,120
你永远是我妹妹
You will always be my sister.

1521
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:20,800
彼得
Pete!

1522
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:26,160
船长在一家旧货店为你找到了这个
Captain found this for you in a junker shop.

1523
02:02:26,170 --> 02:02:28,390
说你有一天会回来的
Said you'd come back to the fold someday.

1524
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:31,880
是什么
What is it?

1525
02:02:32,190 --> 02:02:32,970
叫Zune
It's called a Zune.

1526
02:02:32,970 --> 02:02:35,480
地球人现在都听这玩意了
It's what everybody's listening to on Earth nowadays.

1527
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:36,850
里面能存三百首歌
It's got 300 songs on it.

1528
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:39,080
三百首歌
300 songs?

1529
02:02:44,380 --> 02:02:45,170
等等
Wait.

1530
02:02:51,630 --> 02:02:53,490
火箭把残片捡走 重拼了起来
Rocket grabbed the pieces, and reassembled them.

1531
02:02:53,490 --> 02:02:55,630
我觉得勇度会希望留给你的
I think Yondu would want you to have it.

1532
02:02:59,450 --> 02:03:00,400
谢谢
Thanks...

1533
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:03,560
船长
Captain.

1534
02:04:16,050 --> 02:04:17,220
他们来了
They came.

1535
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:26,430
是什么
What is it?

1536
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:30,130
我给勇度以前的掠夺者朋友去了消息
I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager buddies,

1537
02:04:30,130 --> 02:04:31,680
把他做的事告诉了他们
and told them what he did.

1538
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:36,810
这是掠夺者的葬礼
It's a Ravager funeral.

1539
02:04:54,460 --> 02:04:56,080
好啊
Yeah!

1540
02:04:56,090 --> 02:04:57,410
好
Yeah!

1541
02:05:04,870 --> 02:05:06,900
他终究没有辜负我们 船长
He didn't let us down after all, Captain.

1542
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:09,260
是啊 孩子
No, he did not, son.

1543
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:12,070
他没有
He did not.

1544
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:22,240
永别了 老朋友
Fare thee well, old friend.

1545
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:28,680
勇度·尤冬塔 我们在群星中再会
Yondu Udonta, I will see you in the stars.

1546
02:05:33,090 --> 02:05:34,740
他没把他们赶走
He didn't chase them away.

1547
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:36,110
是啊
No.

1548
02:05:37,370 --> 02:05:39,080
虽然他吼他们
Even though he yelled at them.

1549
02:05:40,150 --> 02:05:41,650
总那么尖酸
And was always mean.

1550
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:46,140
还偷了他用不着的电池
And he stole batteries he didn't need.

1551
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:52,830
当然不会了
Well, of course not.

1552
02:06:17,450 --> 02:06:18,220
怎么了
What?

1553
02:06:19,350 --> 02:06:20,450
就是
It's just...

1554
02:06:23,030 --> 02:06:25,030
心照不宣的情愫
some unspoken thing.

1555
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:36,490
真美
It's beautiful.

1556
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:39,350
是啊
It is.

1557
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:42,320
你也很美
And so are you.

1558
02:06:45,210 --> 02:06:46,410
内在美
On the inside.

1559
02:07:15,390 --> 02:07:19,860
银河护卫队

1560
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:22,450
银河护卫队
还将回归

1561
02:08:41,780 --> 02:08:43,280
真是遗憾
You know, it's a shame...

1562
02:08:43,620 --> 02:08:46,150
要失去勇度这样的惨剧
that it took the tragedy of losing Yondu

1563
02:08:46,150 --> 02:08:47,980
才让我们重聚
to bring us all together again.

1564
02:08:48,330 --> 02:08:50,180
但我觉得如果他知道我们重新组队
But I think he'd be proud knowing that

1565
02:08:50,180 --> 02:08:52,030
一定会骄傲的
we are back as a team.

1566
02:08:52,350 --> 02:08:53,300
我加入
I'm in.

1567
02:08:53,390 --> 02:08:54,170
太好了
Dope.

1568
02:08:54,180 --> 02:08:56,550
我想死你们了
I miss you guys so much!

1569
02:08:56,550 --> 02:08:58,020
太好了
Hell, yes.

1570
02:09:00,870 --> 02:09:02,750
我们去偷点东西吧
What say we steal some shit?

1571
02:11:22,090 --> 02:11:24,650
大祭司 理事会在等您
High Priestess, the Council is waiting.

1572
02:11:25,330 --> 02:11:28,190
他们不满我浪费了资源
They are perturbed I've wasted our resources.

1573
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:34,760
等他们看到了我的创造
When they see what I have created here

1574
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:36,940
他们的愤怒就会消散
their wrath will dissipate.

1575
02:11:39,450 --> 02:11:42,430
是新型生育荚吗 夫人
It's a new type of birthing pod, ma'am?

1576
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:44,790
好孩子 那个
That, my child

1577
02:11:45,220 --> 02:11:47,140
是我们进化的下一步
is the next step in our evolution.

1578
02:11:47,370 --> 02:11:49,810
更强大 更美丽
More powerful, more beautiful,

1579
02:11:50,570 --> 02:11:54,360
更有能力摧毁银河护卫队
more capable of destroying the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1580
02:11:57,340 --> 02:11:59,050
我就叫他
I think I shall call him...

1581
02:12:01,590 --> 02:12:02,520
亚当吧
Adam.

1582
02:14:05,850 --> 02:14:06,730
哥们
Dude.

1583
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:08,490
不是吧
Seriously?

1584
02:14:08,490 --> 02:14:11,160
你得清理你的房间 简直乱成一团
You gotta clean up your room. It's a complete mess.

1585
02:14:11,170 --> 02:14:12,630
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1586
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:14,800
我才不无聊 你才无聊
I am not boring. You're boring.

1587
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:15,760
你知道什么无聊吗
You know what's boring?

1588
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:19,190
坐在那里 玩那个没劲的游戏
Sitting there, playing that mind-numbing game.

1589
02:14:19,190 --> 02:14:22,910
无聊的是我每天要被你的藤蔓绊倒
What's boring is me tripping over your vines every day!

1590
02:14:23,320 --> 02:14:24,620
我才不无聊
I'm not boring!

1591
02:14:24,690 --> 02:14:26,740
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1592
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:29,200
现在我能体会勇度当年的心情了
And now I know how Yondu felt.

1593
02:15:05,510 --> 02:15:07,640
在这艰难时期
In these times of hardship...

1595

我们是格鲁特
We. Are. Groot.

1596
02:15:19,050 --> 02:15:20,190
伙计们
Hey, fellas.

1597

等等 你们去哪
Wait, where are you going?

1598
02:15:22,150 --> 02:15:24,570
你们不是要送我回家的吗
You were supposed to be my lift home.

1599
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:26,530
我要怎么离开啊
How will I get out of here?

1600
02:15:26,940 --> 02:15:27,950
天呐
Aw, gee...

1601
02:15:27,950 --> 02:15:30,820
我还有好多故事要讲呢
I've got so many more stories to tell.

1602
