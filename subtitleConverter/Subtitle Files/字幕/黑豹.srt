他僵住了吧
Did he freeze?

210

就像车前灯下的羚羊
Like an antelope in headlights.

211
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,600
闹够了没
Are you finished?

想得美
You wish!

215
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,680
我是为电磁脉冲珠来的  我做了升级
I'm here for the emp beads. I've developed an update.

216
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,050
升级  不  这个挺好使的
Update? No. It worked perfectly.

217
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,490
我还要教你多少次
How many times do I have to teach you?

218
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,890
就算好使
Just because something works

219
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,830
也总还有改进的空间
doesn't mean that it cannot be improved.

220

你教我  你知道什么啊

比你知道得多

我等不及看你怎么升级
I can't wait to see what kind of update you make

223

你的礼服了

224
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,820

你父亲和我经常谈论这一天

我就是来看看这些文物
I was just checking out these artifacts.

234
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,290
他们说你是位专家
They tell me you're the expert.

235
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,110
可以这么说
You could say that.

236
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,040
它们真美
They're beautiful.

237
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,820
这个是哪来的
Where's this one from?

238
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,820
波波阿尚蒂部落
The bobo ashanti tribe...

239
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,150
在如今的加纳
Present day Ghana...

240
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,330
是19世纪的
19th century.

241
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,220
真的吗
For real?

242
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,220
那这个呢
What about this one?

243
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,460
那个贝宁伊多人的文物
That one's from the Edo people of Benin...

244
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,140
16世纪的
16th century.

245
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,350
再跟我说说这个
Now, tell me about this one.

246
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,380
也是贝宁的  7世纪
Also from Benin, seventh century.

247
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,700
弗拉部落吧
Fula tribe, I believe.

248
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,560
不对
Nah.

249
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,850
什么
I beg your pardon?

250
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,850
是贝宁的英军劫走的
It was taken by British soldiers in Benin

251
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,190
但它原本来自瓦坎达
but it's from Wakanda.

252
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,170
而且是用振金制造的
And it's made out of vibranium.

253
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,640
别担心
Don't trip.

254
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,210
我会把它带走的
I'm gonna take it off your hands for you.

255
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,650
这些文物是不出售的
These items aren't for sale.

256
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,310
你以为你的祖先是怎么得到它们的
How do you think your ancestors got these?

257
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,880
你觉得他们是付了公道的价钱买下的吗
You think they paid a fair price?

258
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,370
还是他们夺走的  就像其他一切他们夺走的东西
Or did they take it, like they took everything else?

259
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,860
先生  我得请你离开了
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

260
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,590
这么多的保安
You got all this security in here

261
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,390
从我走进来就一直盯着我
watching me ever since I walked in.

262
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,240
但你却没注意
But you ain't checking for

263
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,650
自己喝下了什么东西
what you put in your body.

264
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,190
好了  哥们  走吧
All right, mate. Let's have it.

265
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,150
行了  你该走了
Come on, mate. Time.

266
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,480
她好像不太舒服
I think she might not be feeling too good.

267
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,870
救命啊  来人啊
Somebody get some help! Come here!

268
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,090
叫个医生  拜托  谁救救她
Call a doctor, please! Please, somebody, come help!

269
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,480

前往西非展厅  速来
in the west African exhibit, please, right away.

271
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,470
小心
Look out.

272
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,290
请退后  谢谢
Step back, please. Step back. Thank you.

273
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,250
借过  医务人员  借过
Coming through over there. Medics coming through.

274
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,330
我去休息一下
I'm gonna take a break.

275
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,280
给她点空间  拜托
Let's give the lady some space, please.

276
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,310
退后  先生们
Step back, please, gents.

277
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,770
请退后
Step back, please.

278
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,760
过来
Hey, come here.

279
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,680
过来
Come here. Come here.

280
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,940
没事
It's okay.

281
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,250
你可以走  但别告诉任何人  好吗
You can go, but just don't tell anyone, all right?

282
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,220
哥们  你怎么不直接打死他
Bro, why you ain't just shoot him right here?

283
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,000
因为让犯罪现场分散开一点会更好
Because it's better to leave the crime scene more spread out.

284
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,770
让我们显得业余
Makes us look like amateurs.

285
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,560
好了
Now then,

286
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,900
看看你说得对不对吧
let's see if you know what you're talking about.

287
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,290
小试牛刀而已
That's just a taste.

288
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,410
-你要发财了  -你最好赶紧出手
- You're gonna be a rich boy. - You better sell that quick.

289
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,160
已经出手了
It's already sold!

290
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,550
不管你想做什么
Whatever you try,

291
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,040
瓦坎达人会找上门来的
the Wakandans will probably show up.

292
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,470
那最好不过了
That'll make my day.

293
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,820
我可以一石二鸟
I can kill two birds with one stone.

294
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,550
你不是说那也是振金吧
You're not telling me that's vibranium, too?

295
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,070
不  我就是挺喜欢
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

296
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,230
前进
Onward!

297
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,920

为你们请出
Give to you...

301
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,340
特查拉王子
Prince T'Challa...

302
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,130
黑豹
The black panther!

303
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,530
王子
The prince...

304
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,480
现在将被剥去
Will now have the strength of the black panther

305
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,100
黑豹的力量
Stripped away.

306
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,810
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

307
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,170
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

308

仪式格斗的胜利
Victory in ritual combat

309
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,490
由投降或战死决定
Comes by yield or death.

310
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,280
如果有哪个部落要举荐战士
If any tribe wishes to put forth a warrior

311
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,680
现在
I now offer

312
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,570
你有登上王位的机会
a path to the throne.

313
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,500
商贸部落今日不挑战
The merchant tribe will not challenge today.

00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,260
想挑战王位
who wishes to challenge for the throne?

319
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,580
这件束身衣好不舒服
This corset is really uncomfortable...

320
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,310
我们能不能赶紧完事回家了
So could we all just wrap it up and go home?

321
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,600
妈妈
Mother!

322
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,670
-那是贾巴里的人吗  -对

我们厌恶地看着
We have watched with disgust

328
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,670

现在  你们又想把国家
And now you want to hand the nation

332
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,370
交给这位王子
over to this prince...

333
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:11,750
他甚至不能保护自己的父亲
Who could not keep his own father safe.

334
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,190
我们不能允许
We will not have it.

335
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,270
我们不能允许
I said, we will not have it, oh!

好
Yes!

349
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,520
没有神力
No powers.

350
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,590
没有爪子
No claws.

351
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,670
没有战服
No special suit, oh!

352
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,670
只是个不配做领袖的小子
Just a boy not fit to lead!

353
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,750
让他见识你的本事
Show him who you are!

354
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,240
我是特查拉王子
I am prince T'Challa...

瓦坎达万岁

瓦坎达万岁
Wakanda forever!

381
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,690
让心形草
Allow the heart-shaped herb

382
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,000
恢复黑豹神力

383
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,790
并带你进入先祖之域
and take you to the ancestral plane.

384
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,480
特查卡
T'Chaka...

385
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,010

父亲

389
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,910
儿子

390
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,290
对不起

站起来

392
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,580
你是国王了

393
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,190
怎么了  儿子
What is wrong, my son?

394
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,770
我还没准备好
I am not ready.

395
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,480
你难道不是这辈子
Have you not prepared

396
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:50,500
都在为做国王做准备吗
to be king your whole life?

397
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,650
难道你没有一直在我身边
Have you not trained and studied,

398
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,570
学习训练吗
been by my side?

399
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,480
我指的不是这个
That is not what I am talking about.

400
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,020
我还没准备好与你分离
I am not ready to be without you.

401
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,830
没有让孩子准备好
A man who has not prepared his children

402
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,350
面对他死亡的人
for his own death

403
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,480
是个失败的父亲
has failed as a father.

404
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,630
我辜负过你吗
Have I ever failed you?

405
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,090
从没有过
Never.

406
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,630
告诉我怎样最能保护瓦坎达
Tell me how to best protect Wakanda.

407
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,320
我想做个好国王  爸爸

408
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,250
就像您那样
Just like you.

409
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,720
你会面临困境
You're going to struggle.

410
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,180
所以你要让身边
So you'll need to surround yourself

411
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,690
有值得信赖的人
with people you trust.

412
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,670
你是个好人  有善良的心
You're a good man with a good heart.

413
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,110
好人是很难当好国王的
And it's hard for a good man to be king.

414
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,450
呼吸
Breathe.

415
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,090
特查拉  呼吸
T'Challa, breathe.

416
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,420
呼吸
Breathe.

417
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,580
我见到他了
He was there.

418
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,650
我见到他了  我父亲
He was there. My father.

419
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,850
就一个
Just one?

420
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,540
回家吧  娜吉雅
Come home, Nakia .

421
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,520
我不回来了吗
I'm right here.

422
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,560
别再走了
Stay.

423
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,710
我是来支持你
I came to support you

424
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,690
并缅怀你父亲的
and to honor your father...

425
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,880
但我不能留下
But I can't stay.

426
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,760
我在外面世界里找到了自己的使命
It's just, I found my calling out there.

427
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,570
我见到了太多贫困的人  不能再视而不见
I've seen too many in need just to turn a blind eye.

428
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,570
我在这里开心不起来
I can't be happy here

429
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,440
因为我知道外面世界里还有一无所有的人
knowing that there's people out there who have nothing.

430
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,820
那你希望瓦坎达做点什么
What would you have Wakanda do about it?

431
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,560
分享我们的资源
Share what we have.

432
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,720
我们可以提供援助
We could provide aid

433
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,050
分享技术
and access to technology

434
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,670
庇护难民
and refuge to those who need it.

435
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,730
其他国家也这么做  我们能做得更好
Other countries do it, we could do it better.

436
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,470
我们跟其他国家不一样  娜吉雅
We are not like these other countries, Nakia .

437
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,560
如果世界得知了我们真正的样子
If the world found out what we truly are,

438
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,680
我们拥有什么
what we possess,

439
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,850
我们可能会失去现在的生活
we could lose our way of life.

440
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,090
瓦坎达有足够的力量帮助他人
Wakanda is strong enough to help others

441
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,040
并保护自己
and protect ourselves at the same time.

442
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,050
如果你不是这么固执  本可以当个好王后
If you were not so stubborn, you would make a great queen.

443
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,780
正因为我固执  我才能当个好王后
I would make a great queen because I am so stubborn.

444
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,570
-承认了吧  -如果我想当王后的话
- See, you admit it! - If that's what I wanted.

445
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,540
那是它吗
Is that him?

446
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,470
芭丝特保佑  它还在长吗
Glory to Bast, man. Is he still growing?

447
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,260
当然
Of course.

448
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,370
娜吉雅回来了
I see Nakia is back.

449
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,840
你们要再续前缘吗
You guys going to work it out?

450
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:06,670
特查拉
T'Challa...

451
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,400
怎么了
What's wrong?

452
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,920
娜吉雅觉得我们该多做一点
Nakia thinks we should be doing more.

453
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:11,940
怎么多做
More, like what?

454
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,390
援助他国  难民计划
Foreign aid, refugee programs.

455
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,120
你放难民进来
You let the refugees in...

456
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,660
他们只会带来他们的麻烦
They bring their problems with them.

457
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,220
到时瓦坎达就会像其他地方一样了
And then Wakanda is like everywhere else.

458
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,990
如果你要我和我的人
Now if you said you wanted me and my men,

459
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,890
去清扫外面的世界
to go out there and clean up the world,

460
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,210
那我愿意
then I'll be all for it.

461
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,740
但我们从不会
But waging war on other countries

462
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,490
向他国宣战
has never been our way.

463
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,280
你也收到了
You, too, huh?

464
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,120
芭丝特保佑  我们有麻烦了
Bast! We're in trouble.

465
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,230
国王陛下
My king.

466
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,510
亲爱的
My love.

467
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,960
你们绝对猜不到我们刚发现了谁
You will never guess who just popped up on our radar.

468
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,500
一件未能被认出的瓦坎达文物
A misidentified Wakandan artifact

469
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,330
昨日被从大不列颠博物馆盗走
was stolen yesterday from a British museum.

470
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:04,810
我们得知  尤利西斯·克劳
We have learned Ulysses Klaue

471
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:08,000
打算于明晚在韩国将振金
plans to sell the vibranium to an American buyer

472
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,090
出售给美国买家
in South Korea tomorrow night.

473
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,340
克劳已经潜逃近30年了
Klaue has escaped our pursuits for almost 30 years.

474
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:20,900
未能逮捕他  或许是我父亲最大的遗憾
Not capturing him is, perhaps, my father's greatest regret.

475
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,020
我想把克劳抓回来接受审判
I wish to bring Klaue back here to stand trial.

476
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:29,070
瓦坎达现在需要的不是一名战士
Wakanda does not need a warrior right now.

477
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,470
我们需要一名国王
We need a king.

478
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:33,030
我父母在他的袭击中丧生
My parents were killed when he attacked.

479
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,150
我每一天都深深铭记着
Not a day goes by when I do not think about

480
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,860
克劳让我们失去了什么
what Klaue took from us.

481
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:40,670
让我失去了什么
From me.

482
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,650
这个机会太好  不容错过
It's too great an opportunity to pass.

483
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,810
带我一起去吧
Take me with you.

484
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:47,050
我们可以联手拿下他
We'll take him down together, side by side.

485
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,380
我需要你留下保护边境
I need you here protecting the border.

486
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,700
那我请求你
Then I ask,

487
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,640
要么将他就地正法
you kill him where he stands,

- We need to move on Klaue. - Stand down.

647
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,250
不能引起枪战
We can't afford a shootout.

648
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,050
振金呢
Vibranium?

649
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,920
我本想买个高档的公文箱
I was going to buy a fancy suitcase.

650
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,360
但还是决定省省钱
But I thought I'd save myself some money.

651
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,430
再不动手就没机会了
It's now or never.

652
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,520
别妄动
Stand down!

653
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:52,520
我被发现了
I've been made.

654
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:04,660
瓦坎达人  他们来了
Wakandans! They're here!

655
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,080
-快走  -杀光他们
- Get outta here! - Kill 'em all!

656
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,260
快去拿钻石
Diamonds, quick!

657
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:09,280
杀人犯
Murderer!

658
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,710
知道吗
You know,

659
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,730
你跟你老子真像
you look just like your old man.

660
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,880
我撒钱雨了
I made it rain!

661
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,450
我们走吧  老大
Let's get out of here, boss!

662
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,560
太爽了  太爽了
That was awesome! That was awesome!

663
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,830
走吧  开车  快走
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!

664
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:45,140
-我们丢下他吗  -他会追上来的
- Do we just leave him? - He'll catch up.

665
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,520
苏睿
Shuri!

666
00:48:58,550 --> 00:48:59,320
太好了
Yes!

667
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:02,200
遥控驾驶系统已启动
Remote driving system activated.

668
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:04,960
等等  这是左驾还是右驾
Wait! Which side of the road is it?

669
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,820
看在芭丝特的分上
For Bast's sake!

670
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,940
-开吧  -好啦  冷静点
- Just drive! - Okay, calm down!

671
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,450
走咯
Let's go!

672
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,700
放点音乐  你当这是送葬啊
Put some music on. What do you think this is, a funeral?

673
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:24,850
哪辆是他
Which one is he in now?

674
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,980
分头走
Hey, split up!

675
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:32,170
-他们想甩掉我们  -我追右边那个
- They're trying to lose us. - I'll take the right.

676
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:36,530
我们追另两个  我看到条近路
We'll take the other two! I see a shortcut.

677
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,170
我们过不去的
We're not going to make it!

678
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:56,390
继续开
Keep going!

679
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,930
老哥
Brother!

680
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:15,430
那是什么
Hey, what was that?

681
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,570
别想了  你棒棒哒
Don't worry about it. You're doing great.

682
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,270
枪
Guns.

683
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:32,880
真原始
So primitive!

684
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,000
那是振金车  白痴
It's a vibranium car, you idiots!

685
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,580
子弹打不透的
The bullets won't penetrate!

686
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,560
你干什么
What are you doing?

687
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,770
开你的车
Just drive.

688
00:50:58,270 --> 00:50:59,120
该死
Shit!

689
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,750
看你的战服
Look at your suit.

690
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,210
你挨了好多子弹
You've been taking bullets,

691
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,270
战服积蓄了不少动能
charging it up with kinetic energy.

692
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,400
绕到卡车另一边
Pull around the truck.

693
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,250
他哪去了
Where'd he go?

694
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:37,040
臭显摆
You show-off.

695
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:39,460
他在那里
There he is!

696
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:42,650
把住
Hold tight!

697
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,860
好  我们玩玩吧
All right. Let's have some fun!

698
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,760
跳上来
Hop in.

699
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:19,510
把矛放后备箱里吧
Put that spear in the trunk.

700
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:26,300
再快点  苏睿
Faster, Shuri.

701
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,230
我已经开到最快了
I'm going as fast as I can!

702
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,010
右转  右转
Take a right! Take a right!

703
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:37,070
不不
No, no, no!

704
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,270
老哥
Brother!

705
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:04,850
克劳
Klaue!

706
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:08,390
你以为我们会忘记吗
Did you think we would forget?

707
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:19,290
看着我  杀人犯
Look at me, murderer!

708
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,180
这武器你从哪弄来的
Where did you get this weapon?

709
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,280
你们这些蛮子不配拥有它
You savages didn't deserve it.

710
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:30,890
饶命啊  陛下  饶命
Oh, mercy, king. Mercy.

711
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:33,290
你喘的每一口气都是我仁慈的体现
Every breath you take is mercy from me.

712
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:34,420
陛下
King!

713
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,670
世界在看着呢
The world watches.

714
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,150
几位  我们快走吧
Come on. Guys. Let's go, huh?

715
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:46,300
嗯
Yeah.

716
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,520
有人吗
Hello.

717
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,520
我看得到你们  真的
I can see you! I can. I can see you.

718
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:17,580
真是闹得好大
So this is a big mess, huh?

719
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,160
我们不如唱红脸白脸
I figured we could go good cop, bad cop.

720
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:21,340
我先进去跟他谈  然后你们去
I'll talk to him first, then you guys go in.

721
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:24,800
我们不能让他单独跟克劳谈
We can't let him talk to Klaue alone.

722
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:31,170
最好让他单独跟克劳谈5分钟
Better to let him talk to Klaue alone for 5 minutes

723
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,870
别在这里闹不愉快
than to make a scene here.

724
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:36,630
等你审问过他
After your questioning,

725
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:38,640
我们要带他回瓦坎达
we will take him back to Wakanda with us.

726
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,440
什么  不行
What? No.

727
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,390
我很喜欢你
Look, I like you, a lot.

728
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:44,360
但他已经被我缉拿  他哪里都不去
But he's in my custody now. He's not going anywhere.

729
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,150
听着  我光是允许你们来
Listen, I'm doing you guys a favor

730
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,780
就是给你们面子了
by letting you even be in here.

731
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,840
他再敢碰你一次
If he touches you again,

732
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:56,030
我就把他插在那个桌子上
I'm going to impale him to this desk.

733
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,040
她会说英语吗
Does she speak english?

734
00:54:58,530 --> 00:54:59,920
她想说就说
When she wants to.

735
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:02,860
我进去了
I'm going in.

736
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:05,380
等我问完了  你们再上
When I'm done, you guys are up.

737
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:07,170
-罗斯特工  -怎么
- Agent Ross. - Yeah?

738
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,740
我很感谢你在釜山的帮助
I do appreciate your help in Busan.

739
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,210
瞧见没
You see that?

740
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,310
这叫外交
It's called diplomacy.

741
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,500
不客气
You're welcome.

742
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:19,930
奥克耶
Okoye.

743
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:21,940
客气点
Play nice.

744
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,310
美国人啊
Americans.

745
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:26,780
不要再伤害我
Don't hurt me no more

746
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,570
爱是什么
What is love?

747
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:30,870
宝贝  别再伤害我
Baby, don't hurt me

748
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:34,090
不要再伤害我
Don't hurt me no more

749
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,260
你不该相信那些瓦坎达人
You know, you really shouldn't trust the Wakandans.

750
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,760
我跟你才是一类人
I'm much more your speed.

751
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,800
我干这行  谁都不信任
I don't trust anybody, not in this job.

752
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,680
但我对外面那门手臂炮感兴趣
But what I am interested in is that arm cannon out there.

753
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:44,460
那是哪来的
Where'd you get that?

754
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,620
就是被我调试过的旧采矿工具
It's an old mining tool that I made some adjustments to.

755
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,990
但如果你要  我可以给你弄一个
But I can get you one, if you like.

756
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:50,790
你何不说出你供货商的名字
Why don't you give me the name of your supplier,

757
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:52,240
我直接去找他们要
and I'll ask them.

758
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,610
他就在外面
He's right outside.

759
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,740
你自己去问他好了
Why don't you ask him yourself?

760
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:56,900
什么  特查拉吗
What? T'Challa?

761
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,770
你是说你手臂上的武器是瓦坎达来的
You're telling me that weapon on your arm is from Wakanda?

762
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,030
对了
Bingo.

763
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:06,300
你对瓦坎达究竟有什么了解
What do you actually know about Wakanda?

764
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,020
牧羊  纺织  衣服很酷
Shepherds, textiles, cool outfits.

765
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,590
那都是幌子
It's all a front.

766
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,210
探索者找了那里几个世纪
Explorers searched for it for centuries.

767
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:18,280
传说中的黄金城
El dorado, the golden city.

768
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:20,510
他们以为是在南美洲
They thought they could find it in South America,

769
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:23,670
但其实本就是在非洲
but it was in Africa the whole time.

770
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,890
一个科技奇迹
A technological marvel.

771
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:27,520
就因为这个国家脚下
All because it was built

772
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,590
就是世上最珍惜的金属
on a mound of the most valuable metal known to man.

773
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,810
他们称之为"天赐"
Isipho, they call it. The gift.

774
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:35,340
就是振金
Vibranium.

775
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:37,730
振金  嗯  地球上最坚硬的金属
Vibranium, yeah, strongest metal on earth.

776
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,100
不仅仅是金属
It's not just a metal.

777
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,280
他们把它缝进衣服里
They sew it into their clothes.

778
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:44,200
用它为城市供能  开发科技
It powers their city, their tech,

779
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,270
制造武器
their weapons.

780
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:47,830
武器
Weapons?

781
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:48,850
是的
Yeah.

782
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:51,760
我的手臂炮相比之下就像吹叶机
Makes my arm cannon look like a leaf blower.

783
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,960
这真是个美丽的童话
That's a nice fairy tale,

784
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,020
但瓦坎达是个第三世界国家
but Wakanda is a third world country,

785
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,420
而且你把他们的振金都偷走了
and you stole all their vibranium.

786
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:59,140
我偷...
I stole...

787
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:03,520
我都偷走了
All of it?

788
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:07,930
我拿的不过九牛一毛
I took a tiny piece of it.

789
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,580
他们还有整整一山的
They have a mountain full of it.

790
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,900
他们已经开采了数千年
They've been mining it for thousands of years...

791
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,180
却还只是触及了矿藏的表层
And they still haven't scratched the surface.

792
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,500
我是唯一见到了真相
I'm the only outsider who's seen it

793
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,110
还活着出来的外人
and got out of there alive.

794
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:19,560
如果你不信
If you don't believe me,

795
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:23,390
你去问问你的朋友  他的战服是什么做的
you ask your friend what his suit is made of.

796
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:25,820
他的爪子是什么做的
What his claws are made of.

797
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:50,580
你父亲对联合国说
Your father told the UN

798
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:53,680
克劳盗走了你们全部的振金
that Klaue stole all the vibranium you had.

799
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,560
但现在他却说你们还有
But now he's telling me you have more.

800
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,190
你相信一个
And you believe the word

801
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:59,910
捆在椅子上的军火贩的话吗
of an arms dealer strapped to a chair?

802
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,590
这是哪里
Where is that?

803
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,000
后面
Back there.

804
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,680
你们还藏了多少
How much more are you hiding?

805
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,480
外面有情况
Something is happening out back.

806
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:45,870
趴下
Get down!

807
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:52,390
别动
Stand down!

808
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:56,380
找掩护
Cover!

809
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,900
手雷
Grenade!

810
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,250
你们还真是不紧不慢啊
I see you took your time, didn't you?

811
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,560
陛下
My king!

812
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:28,790
陛下
My king.

813
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:30,280
娜吉雅
Nakia.

814
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,200
他替我挡了子弹
He just jumped in front of me.

815
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,470
他在这里是治不好的
I don't think he'll make it here.

816
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:40,640
子弹击中了脊椎
It hit his spine.

817
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,200
给我一颗灵珠
Give me a kimoyo bead.

818
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,650
这能暂时稳定他的情况
This will stabilize him for now.

819
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:00,680
把他交给我们
Give him to us.

820
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,170
我们可以救他
We can save him.

821
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:14,740
我们的任务是抓克劳回去
Our mission was to bring back Klaue.

822
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:16,990
我们失败了
We failed.

823
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:20,860
此人还是外国情报人员
This man is a foreign intelligence operative.

824
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:23,190
我们要如何解释带他进入国境内
How do we justify bringing him into our borders?

825
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:24,980
他替我挡了子弹
He took a bullet for me.

826
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,820
那是他的选择
That was his choice.

827
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,150
那我们就要任由他死去吗
So now we are just supposed to let him die?

828
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:31,400
想想看  如果我们治好了他
Let us consider that we heal him.

829
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:35,180
他有责任向他的国家汇报情况
It is his duty to report back to his country.

830
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:37,950
作为国王  你则有责任保护我们国家
And as king, it is your duty to protect ours.

831
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:40,540
我很清楚我的职责  将军
I'm well aware of my duties, general.

832
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:44,290
我不能任他死去
I cannot just let him die,

833
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:46,830
而我们明明能救他
knowing we can save him.

834
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,790
我们究竟要带他去哪
Where exactly are we taking him?

835
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:00,620
好啊  又带来个受伤的白人让我们治
Great! Another broken white boy for us to fix.

836
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:02,240
这会很好玩的
This is going to be fun.

837
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,780
他不会有事的
He will live.

838
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,290
瓦卡比来了
W'Kabi is here.

839
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:27,990
怎么回事  兄弟  克劳呢
What's going on, brother? Where is Klaue?

840
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:29,750
他不在
He's not here.

841
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:36,100
他从我们掌心里溜走了
He slipped through our hands.

842
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,720
"溜走了"
"Slipped"?

843
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:44,450
你父亲掌权30年  什么都没做
For 30 years, your father was in power and did nothing.

844
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,750
我以为你会有所不同
With you, I thought it'd be different.

845
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:49,680
但看来还是那样
But it's more of the same.

846
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:10,930
我们走吧  老大
Let's get going, boss.

847
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:14,830
你总卖给中情局吗
You always sell to the CIA?

848
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,600
我卖给出价最高者
I sell to the highest bidder.

849
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:19,440
别担心  等我回了约翰内斯堡
But don't you worry. When I get back to Joburg,

850
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:20,850
避过了这阵风头
and I lay low for a bit,

851
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:22,670
我会让你俩拿到工钱的
I'll make sure both you guys get paid.

852
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:24,160
我才不担心钱的事呢
I ain't worried about the money, bro.

853
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,290
我知道你拿得出
I know you good for it.

854
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,100
我们回去的路上  把我们丢在瓦坎达就好
On our way back, just drop us off in Wakanda.

855
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:29,350
你可不想去那里  小子
You don't want to go there, boy.

856
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,350
我想去
Yeah, I do.

857
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,250
放下
Drop it!

858
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,660
否则你们雌雄大盗的组合  就今天解散
Or your little Bonnie and Clyde routine ends today.

859
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,780
马上放下枪
Put your gun down now!

860
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:41,120
对不起
I'm sorry.

861
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,350
-对不起  埃里克  -没事的
- Sorry, Erik. - It's gonna be okay.

862
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,430
你真想去瓦坎达
You really want to go to Wakanda?

863
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,050
他们都是蛮子
They're savages.

864
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:21,310
他们就这么对我们这样的人
This is what they do to people like us.

865
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:22,770
我可不怕烙印
I ain't worried about no brand.

866
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:23,810
看这个
Check these out.

867
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:26,990
每个都代表我杀的一个人
Each one is for a kill.

868
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:30,170
你怎么伤害自己无所谓
You can scar yourself as much as you'd like.

869
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:33,100
在他们看来  你始终是个外人
To them, you'll just be an outsider.

870
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:35,850
你要是以为自己能走进去就是疯了
You're crazy to think that you can walk in there.

871
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:46,110
我还当你是个疯子美国人呢
To think I saw you as some crazy American.

872
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,680
下去
Leave us!

873
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:15,440
你的任务未能如愿
So your mission did not go as planned.

874
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:20,160
我叔叔尼乔布究竟发生了什么
What happened to my uncle N'Jobu?

875
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,660
我父亲说他失踪了
My father told me he disappeared.

876
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:26,210
今天有个男人
There was a man today,

877
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:30,810
戴了跟这枚一样的戒指
wearing a ring identical to this one.

878
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:34,790
那不可能
That is not possible.

879
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:38,810
他帮助了克劳逃脱  而且他戴了这枚戒指
He helped Klaue escape from us and he was wearing this ring!

880
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:40,750
我爷爷的戒指
My grandfather's ring!

881
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,790
别告诉我什么可能不可能
Do not tell me what is possible.

882
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:44,020
告诉我真相
Tell me the truth!

883
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:50,020
有些真相
Some truths...

884
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:56,390
太过沉重  特查拉
Are too much to bear, T'Challa.

885
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,010
那不是由你来决定
That is not your choice to make.

886
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,120
他究竟怎么了
What happened to him?

887
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,490
我向国王保证过不会说的
I promised the king to say nothing.

888
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,270
现在我是你的国王了
I'am your king now!

889
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,700
你叔叔接受了
Your uncle took...

890
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,540
去美国做战士的任务
A war dog assignment in America.

891
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:32,580
你父亲
Your father...

892
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:35,780
把我安插在了那里
Placed me there...

893
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:37,490
观察他
To observe...

894
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:40,380
而他并不知情
Unbeknownst to him.

895
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,740
你叔叔爱上了个美国女人
Your uncle fell in love with an American woman.

896
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:45,820
他们生了个孩子
They had a child.

897
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:49,680
他在那里看到的困苦
The hardships he saw there...

898
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:52,950
让他变得激进
Radicalized your uncle.

899
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:55,350
我袖手旁观了很久
I observed for as long as I could.

900
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:58,110
他们的领袖遭人暗杀
Their leaders have been assassinated.

901
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:00,910
他们的社区被毒品和武器淹没
Communities flooded with drugs and weapons.

902
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:03,680
他们遭受警察暴力  执法过度
They are overly policed and incarcerated.

903
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,540
在世界各地
All over the planet

904
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:06,830
我们的同胞饱受苦难
our people suffer because

905
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:09,390
就因为他们没有反抗的能力
they don't have the tools to fight back.

906
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:11,250
如果有了振金武器
With vibranium weapons,

907
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:12,920
他们可以推翻每一个国家
they could overthrow every country,

908
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,760
瓦坎达可以一统天下
and Wakanda could rule them all

909
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,190
好好治理
the right way.

910
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:20,130
他知道你父亲绝不会答应
He knew your father would not support this.

911
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:23,950
所以  你叔叔背叛了我们
So, your uncle betrayed us.

912
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:25,120
不
No!

913
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,620
他帮助克劳盗取了振金
He helped Klaue steal the vibranium.

914
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,170
不不
No, no, no.

915
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:33,680
你要马上回国
You will return home at once...

916
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,390
并面见议会
Where you will face the council...

917
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:38,090
向他们坦白你的罪行
And inform them of your crimes.

918
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:40,650
他举起枪对准了我
He drew his weapon on me.

919
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:41,360
不
No!

920
01:06:57,950 --> 01:07:01,060
你父亲杀了亲弟弟
Your father killed his own brother...

921
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:05,590
好救我
to save my life.

922
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:12,720
决不许说出去
Speak nothing of this.

923
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,340
那孩子呢
And the child?

924
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,630
我们丢下了他
We left him.

925
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,330
我们必须
We had to...

926
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,820
守住
maintain...

927
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,420
那个谎言
the lie.

928
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:05,230
这是什么
What is this?

929
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,320
一份薄礼
Just a little gift.

930
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:31,390
你是谁
Who are you?

931
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:22,990
好吧  我在哪
All right, where am l?

932
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:26,190
别那么吓我  殖民者
Don't scare me like that, colonizer!

933
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:28,390
什么  我叫埃弗雷特
What? My name is Everett.

934
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:31,550
我知道  埃弗雷特·罗斯
Yes, I know. Everett Ross...

935
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:34,450
前空军飞行员  现中情局特工
Former air force pilot and now CIA.

936
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:35,910
没错
Right.

937
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,380
好吧  这是瓦坎达吗
Okay, is this Wakanda?

938
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:44,060
不  是堪萨斯
No, it's Kansas.

939
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:48,970
韩国是多久之前了
How long ago was Korea?

940
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:50,190
昨天
Yesterday.

941
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:51,280
不可能
I don't think so.

942
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:53,940
枪伤不会魔法般地一夜恢复
Bullet wounds don't just magically heal overnight.

943
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:56,170
在这里可以
They do here.

944
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:58,980
但不是靠魔法  是靠科技
But not by magic, by technology.

945
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:07,090
什么都别碰  我哥哥很快就会回来
Don't touch anything. My brother will return soon.

946
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:33,130
这些火车
These train things...

947
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,910
是磁悬浮的吧
That's magnetic levitation, right?

948
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:37,070
当然了
Obviously.

949
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:41,620
当然了  但我从没见过这么高效的
Obviously, but I've never seen it this efficient.

950
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:45,540
那个灯板  是干什么的
The light panels, what are they?

951
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:48,060
-声波稳定器  -什么
- Sonic stabilizers. - Sonic what?

952
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:51,290
未加工的振金太过危险
In its raw form vibranium is too dangerous

953
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:53,000
不能高速运输
to be transported at that speed,

954
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,510
所以我发明了一种办法让它暂时失效
so I developed a way to temporarily deactivate it.

955
01:10:57,630 --> 01:10:59,220
那些火车上是振金
There's vibranium on those trains?

956
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:01,600
我们周围到处是振金
There's vibranium all around us.

957
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:04,570
我就是靠这个治好了你
That's how I healed you.

958
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:14,440
特查拉呢
Where is T'Challa?

959
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,660
他的灵珠被关闭了
His kimoyo beads have been switched off.

960

我们又不是连体婴  奥克耶

961

有个男人出现在了边境

瓦卡比此刻正在送他去王宫

965
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,630

一个外人吗

他不是瓦坎达人
He's not a Wakandan.

969
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:35,840
他是我们的人

还丢下了一个孩子

人无完人
No man is perfect.

976

977

他都没好好安葬他
He didn't even give him a proper burial.

978
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:14,790
我叔叔尼乔布背叛了我们  但我父亲

你不能让你父亲的错误决定你的为人

982

你才能决定你要做怎样的国王

哥哥  你得马上回来

在那里杀人无数

989
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:56,800
好像在打电游
like it was a video game.

990
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:58,670
开始有了杀人魔头的称号
Started calling him killmonger.

991

他加入了一个联合特种作战司令部的秘密部队

他们可不是闹着玩的
Now these guys are serious.

993
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,920
他们会隐藏起来
They will drop off the grid,

994
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:04,210
进行刺杀
so they can commit assassinations

颠覆政府
and take down governments.

996

他有透露过他的身份吗

他有战士文身
He has a war dog tattoo,

998
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:14,430
但我们并无他的记录
but we have no record of him.

999
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:23,570
这人到底是不是瓦坎达人
Is this man Wakandan or not?

1000
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:25,540
告诉我们究竟怎么回事
Tell us what is going on.

01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:56,410
盗走你们振金  还杀了你们人的罪人

1006
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,100
这是你们国王没能做到的
Justice your king couldn't deliver.

1007
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:06,680
我不管你是不是带来了克劳
I don't care that you brought Klaue.

1008
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,240
我之所以没有就地杀了你
Only reason I don't kill you where you stand

1009
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,370
是因为我知道你的身份
is because I know who you are.

1010
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:14,330
你想怎么样
Now, what do you want?

我想要王位

1012
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:20,810

01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,120
全世界还有

20亿跟我们一样黑皮肤的人

但他们的生活要艰辛得多

1018

瓦坎达有解放他们所有人的工具
Wakanda has the tools to liberate 'em all.

1019
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:38,710
什么工具呢

我们的武器绝不会用来向世界发动战争

我们不会去评判外人的行为

1023
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:51,660
并决定赏罚

1024
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,180
外人
Not your own?

1025
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,920
但生命不是在这个大陆上诞生的吗
But didn't life start right here on this continent?

1026
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,560
那么所有人不都该是你的同胞吗
So ain't all people your people?

1027
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:01,530
我不是所有人的国王  我是瓦坎达的国王

拒绝他的要求

他要保护你们吗
He's supposed to protect you?

1115
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,990
-不  -不
- No. - No!

1116
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:51,040
不
No!

1117
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:56,800
不  我才是你们的国王
Nah. I'm your king.

1118
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,820
-不  -我们得走了
- No! No! - We have to go now!

1119
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:00,460
王太后  我们得走了
Queen mother, let's go!

1120
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:38,670
王太后和苏睿  她们安全吗
The queen mother and Shuri, they are safe?

1121
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:39,540
是的
Yes.

1122
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:41,520
谢谢
Thank you.

1123
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:43,960
我们得立刻去找她们
We should get to them immediately.

1124
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:45,940
我不能去
I cannot.

1125
01:22:46,330 --> 01:22:48,230
-什么  -虽然我的心与你们同在
- What? - Though my heart is with you.

1126
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,170
我们不能把这个国家交给一个
We cannot turn over our nation to a man

1127
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:54,240
几小时前才到来的男人
who showed up here only hours ago.

1128
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,330
他是王室血脉
He is of royal blood.

1129
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:57,700
-他杀了特查拉  -那是仪式格斗
- He killed T'Challa! - In ritual combat.

1130
01:22:57,710 --> 01:22:59,430
那真的要紧吗
Does that really matter?

1131
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:05,060
你是瓦坎达最伟大的战士
You are the greatest warrior Wakanda has.

1132
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:09,770
帮我推翻他  别让他羽翼丰满起来
Help me overthrow him before he becomes too strong.

1133
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:10,770
推翻
Overthrow?

1134
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:12,580
娜吉雅
Nakia!

1135
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,510
我不是个可以自由来去的探子
I'm not a spy who can come and go as they so choose!

1136
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:23,130
我要忠于王位  不管坐在上面的是谁
I am loyal to that throne, no matter who sits upon it.

1137
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,530
你忠于什么
What are you loyal to?

1138
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,180
我爱他
I loved him.

1139
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:33,650
我也爱我的国家
I loved my country, too.

1140
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:36,430
那你就该效忠国家
Then you serve your country.

1141
01:23:36,430 --> 01:23:39,380
不  我要救我的国家
No. I save my country.

1142
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:49,550
怎么了
What's wrong?

1143
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,260
国王死了
The king is dead.

1144
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:54,820
跟我来  除非你也想一起死
Come with me, unless you want to join him.

1145
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:16,070
先是爸爸
First Baba.

1146
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:19,110
现在又是我哥哥
And now my brother.

1147
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:24,930
妈妈  我们都不能安葬他
Mama, we didn't even get to bury him.

1148
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:33,640
-是我  -娜吉雅
- It's me. - Nakia.

1149
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:35,260
这人是谁
Who is this man?

1150
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:37,320
他是特查拉的朋友  他救了我一命
He's a friend of T'Challa's. He saved my life.

1151
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:39,500
奥克耶呢
Where's Okoye?

1152
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:40,720
她不来了
Okoye is not coming.

1153
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:43,190
她和女子皇家护卫队要效忠新王
She and the dora Milaje will serve the new king.

1154
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,050
等在这里
Wait here.

1155
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:56,390
我们的瓦坎达是怎么了
What has happened to our Wakanda?

1156
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:01,730
让心形草
Allow the heart-shaped herb

1157
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:04,530
赋予你黑豹的神力
to give you the powers of the black panther,

1158
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:07,800
并带你进入先祖之域
and take you to the ancestral plane.

1159
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,440
不是叫你别乱翻我的东西吗
What did I tell you about going into my things?

1160
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:55,090
你找到了什么
What did you find?

1161
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,090
你的家乡
Your home.

1162
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,920
我给了你钥匙  就是希望你有一日能见到那里
I gave you a key hoping that you might see it someday.

1163
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:05,360
对
Yes.

1164
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,490
那里有世上最美的日落
The sunsets there are the most beautiful in the world.

1165
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:13,440
但恐怕你还是不会受欢迎
But I fear you still may not be welcome.

1166
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:16,700
为什么
Why?

1167
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:20,840
他们会说你迷失了
They will say you are lost.

1168
01:27:21,450 --> 01:27:22,510
但我就在这里
But I'm right here.

1169
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,350
不为我流泪吗
No tears for me?

1170
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:35,150
人人都会死
Everybody dies.

1171
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:39,000
这里的生活就是如此
It's just life around here.

1172
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,080
看看我做了什么
Well, look at what I have done.

1173
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:49,130
我早该带你回去的
I should've taken you back long ago.

1174
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:54,650
结果  我们都被抛弃在了这里
Instead, we are both abandoned here.

1175
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,300
或许你的家乡才迷失了
Well, maybe your home is the one that's lost.

1176
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:06,200
所以他们才找不到我们
That's why they can't find us.

1177
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:16,420
呼吸  呼吸  国王陛下  呼吸
Breathe! Breathe, my king, breathe.

1178
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:18,410
呼吸  呼吸
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

1179
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:37,480
那是心形草的效力
The heart-shaped herb did that?

1180
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:41,100
这是全部的了吗
This all of it?

1181
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:43,650
对  这样等再有下任国王时
Yes. So when it comes time for another king,

1182
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:44,800
我们会有所准备
we will be ready.

1183
01:28:45,650 --> 01:28:46,760
下任国王
Another king?

1184
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,590
全烧了吧
Yeah, go ahead and burn all that.

1185
01:28:51,010 --> 01:28:52,750
陛下  我们不能那么做
My king, we cannot do that.

1186
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:54,170
这是我们的传统
It is our tradition...

1187
01:28:57,610 --> 01:29:00,930
我叫你做什么的话  我就不是闹着玩的
When I tell you to do something, I mean that shit.

1188
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:05,490
全烧了
Burn it all!

1189
01:29:55,290 --> 01:29:56,470
在我们那里
You know, where I'm from...

1190
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:59,240
黑人掀起革命时
when black folks started revolutions,

1191
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:01,200
从来没有足够火力
they never had the firepower,

1192
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:03,870
和资源去对抗压迫者
or the resources to fight their oppressors.

1193
01:30:04,450 --> 01:30:05,500
那时候瓦坎达在哪
Where was Wakanda?

1194
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:13,640
到此为止了
Yeah, all that ends today.

1195
01:30:14,180 --> 01:30:17,160
我们在全球每个国家都有探子
We got spies embedded in every nation on earth.

1196
01:30:17,230 --> 01:30:18,470
都已就位
Already in place.

1197
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:20,660
我知道殖民者怎么思考
I know how colonizers think.

1198
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:23,010
我们就用他们的策略对付他们
So we're gonna use their own strategy against 'em.

1199
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:26,960
我们要把振金武器送去给我们的战士
We're gonna send vibranium weapons out to our war dogs.

1200
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:29,870
让他们把武器分给全世界的被压迫者
They'll arm oppressed people all over the world...

1201
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,760
让他们能起义  杀死当权者
so they can finally rise up and kill those in power.

1202
01:30:32,810 --> 01:30:33,920
还有他们的孩子
And their children.

1203
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:36,050
和其他与他们同流的人
And anyone else who takes their side.

1204
01:30:36,610 --> 01:30:38,660
该让他们知道我们真实的样子了
It's time they know the truth about us!

1205
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:40,210
我们是战士
We're warriors!

1206
01:30:40,910 --> 01:30:44,040
世界要大翻盘  这次  我们要占据上风
The world's gonna start over, and this time, we're on top.

1207
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:48,600
瓦坎达将成为日不落帝国
The sun will never set on the Wakandan empire.

1208
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:52,310
瓦坎达能延续至今
Wakanda has survived for so long,

1209
01:30:52,370 --> 01:30:56,030
一直是只在绝对必要时动武
by fighting when only absolutely necessary.

1210
01:30:56,030 --> 01:30:58,950
瓦坎达过去的确是如此行事
Wakanda survived in the past this way, yes.

1211
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:02,290
但世界在改变  将军
But the world is changing, general.

1212
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:06,030
长老们  世界越来越小了
Elders, it is getting smaller.

1213
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:08,180
外面的世界在追赶上来
The outside world is catching up.

1214
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:10,740
很快  局面就会成为不去征服
And soon it will be the conquerors

1215
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:12,810
便会被征服
or the conquered.

1216
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:16,300
我宁可做前者
I'd rather be the former.

1217
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:21,150
你们都听到命令了  我们开始吧
You heard your orders. Let's get to it.

1218
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:24,340
我们要去哪
So where are we going again?

1219
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:27,240
我们要带心形草去贾巴里部落
We're taking the heart-shaped herb to Jabaril and.

1220
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:29,100
心形草  那是什么
Heart-shaped herb? What is that?

1221
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:31,640
服用者能获得增强的能力
It gives whoever takes it heightened abilities.

1222
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:34,230
所以特查拉才那么强壮
It's what made T'Challa so strong.

1223
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:35,890
娜吉雅
Nakia.

1224
01:31:40,190 --> 01:31:41,460
这样不好
I don't like this.

1225
01:31:41,870 --> 01:31:43,490
心形草是我们的
The herb belongs to us.

1226
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:47,470
给姆巴库  可能会造就更大的怪物
We may be creating a bigger monster with M'Baku.

1227
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:57,320
娜吉雅  你该自己服下它
Nakia, you should take it yourself.

1228
01:31:57,820 --> 01:32:01,380
我是个探子  还没有军队
I am a spy with no army.

1229
01:32:02,530 --> 01:32:04,220
我绝无机会的
I wouldn't stand a chance.

1230
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:07,030
我们去吧
We'll go.

1231
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:15,200
天呐
Oh, boy.

1232
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,140
该死
Oh, shit.

1233
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:24,890
低头  保持冷静
Look down. Stay calm.

1234
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:26,130
苏睿
Shuri.

1235
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:28,390
低头
Look down.

1236
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:05,570
我儿子
My son...

1237
01:33:07,730 --> 01:33:10,600
在仪式格斗中被杀
was murdered in ritual combat.

1238
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:12,610
-机会公平吗  -是的  但是
- Were the odds fair? - Yes, but...

1239
01:33:12,610 --> 01:33:14,850
那就不是"被杀"  而是"被击败"
So it was less a murder than a defeat.

1240
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:17,140
-别戳我们的痛处  -闭嘴
- Do not rub our noses in it! - Silence!

1241
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:20,420
在这里  我才有权说话  小丫头
I make the pronouncements here, girl.

1242
01:33:20,430 --> 01:33:24,970
殿下  新王是个美国...
Look, uh, your highness, the new king is a U.S...

1243
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:26,400
新王
The new king...

1244
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:37,240
你不能说话
You cannot talk!

1245
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:38,790
再多说一句
One more word,

1246
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:41,220
我就拿你喂我的孩子
and I will feed you to my children.

1247
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:47,810
我开玩笑的  我们吃素的
I'm kidding. We are vegetarians.

1248
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,920
大猩猩姆巴库
Great gorilla M'Baku...

1249
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:04,050
我们是为此而来
This is why we are here.

1250
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:06,840
我们要把它献给你
To offer this to you.

1251
01:34:07,170 --> 01:34:09,850
一个外人坐在了王位上
An outsider sits on our throne.

1252
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:12,210
只有你能帮我们阻止他
Only you can help us stop him.

1253
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:30,910
跟我来
Come with me.

1254
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:49,380
不可能
Impossible!

1255
01:34:55,110 --> 01:34:56,170
他还有气吗
Is he breathing?

1256
01:34:56,170 --> 01:34:59,010
他陷入了昏迷  生命垂危
He's in a coma. Barely clinging to life.

1257
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:01,190
我们的一个渔人发现了他
One of our fishermen found him

1258
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:02,860
漂到了河边
at the edge of the river border.

1259
01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:04,480
他把他带来给了我
He brought him to me.

1260
01:35:04,530 --> 01:35:05,990
你怎么把他放在雪里
Why do you have him in the snow?

1261
01:35:05,990 --> 01:35:07,290
这是唯一让他不会
It is the only thing keeping him

1262
01:35:07,290 --> 01:35:08,970
去见祖先的东西
from joining the ancestors.

1263
01:35:08,970 --> 01:35:11,370
我们得送他去我的实验室  我在那里能治好他
We need to get him to my lab. I can heal him there.

1264
01:35:11,370 --> 01:35:13,520
带他走吧  他不出几秒就会死
Take him. He'll be dead in seconds.

1265
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:16,710
娜吉雅  心形草
Nakia, the herb.

1266
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:35,570
我呼唤祖先
I call upon the ancestors.

1267
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:37,630
我呼唤芭丝特
I call upon bast.

1268
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:41,240
我跟我儿子  特查拉在一起
I am here with my son, T'Challa.

1269
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,510
治好他
Heal him.

1270
01:35:55,740 --> 01:35:58,580
我们得把他埋起来  盖住他
We must bury him. Cover him. Cover him!

1271
01:35:58,580 --> 01:35:59,360
好
Okay.

1272
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:13,530
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

1273
01:36:13,530 --> 01:36:15,020
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

1274
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:16,580
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

1275
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:17,950
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

1276
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,500
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

1277
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:22,540
醒醒  特查拉
Wake up, T'Challa.

1278
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:24,760
醒来吧
Wake up.

1279
01:36:27,190 --> 01:36:28,210
儿子
My son.

1280
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:37,750
你该回家来
The time has come for you to come home...

1281
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:40,130
跟我团聚了
And be reunited with me.

1282
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:52,530
为什么
Why?

1283
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:57,640
你为什么不带那男孩回家
Why didn't you bring the boy home?

1284
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,230
为什么  爸爸
Why, Baba?

1285
01:37:03,130 --> 01:37:04,000
他
He...

1286
01:37:05,490 --> 01:37:08,310
他是我选择无视的真相
He was the truth I chose to omit.

1287
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,260
你不该抛弃他
You were wrong to abandon him.

1288
01:37:12,550 --> 01:37:14,520
我选择了我的人民
I chose my people.

1289
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:17,220
我选择了瓦坎达
I chose Wakanda.

1290
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:19,950
我们的未来需要...
Our future depended...

1291
01:37:19,950 --> 01:37:21,230
你错了
You were wrong!

1292
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:23,640
你们都错了
All of you were wrong!

1293
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:27,650
对外面的世界袖手旁观
To turn your backs on the rest of the world!

1294
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:32,300
我们因为害怕被发现
We let the fear of our discovery

1295
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:34,620
而没有做正确的事
stop us from doing what is right!

1296
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:36,920
再不能了
No more!

1297
01:37:41,070 --> 01:37:44,920
我不能留下陪你
I cannot stay here with you.

1298
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:50,910
我不能安心地让他坐在王位上
I cannot rest while he sits on the throne.

1299
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:54,650
他是我们制造出来的怪物
He is a monster of our own making.

1300
01:37:56,110 --> 01:37:59,470
我必须夺回王位  必须
I must take the mantle back. I must!

1301
01:38:01,530 --> 01:38:03,880
我必须纠正错误
I must right these wrongs.

1302
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:16,470
你们有毯子吗
Do you have a blanket?

1303
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:22,630
杀人魔头有军队的完全支持
Killmonger has the full support of our military.

1304
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:23,650
而且
And

1305
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:27,350
他还烧掉了心形草园
he burned the garden of the heart-shaped herb.

1306
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:29,070
当然了
Of course he did.

1307
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:30,420
那是他受的训练
That's what he was trained to do.

1308
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:32,620
他的部队以前曾跟中情局合作
His unit used to work with the CIA

1309
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:34,830
颠覆外国政权
to destabilize foreign countries.

1310
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:37,060
他们总在权力交接时出手
They would always strike at transitions of power...

1311
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:39,340
比如大选之年  或是国王死后
Like an election year, or the death of a monarch.

1312
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:41,960
控制政府  军队
You get control of government, the military...

1313
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:43,800
-我们的资源  -没错
- Our resources. - Right.

1314
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:46,190
圣山
The great mound.

1315
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:48,340
我们的振金  我的科技
Our vibranium, all of my designs.

1316
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:50,620
他会把我们的武器送去全世界
He will send our weapons all over the world.

1317
01:38:54,090 --> 01:38:56,410
你必须带她们安全离开瓦坎达
You must get them out of Wakanda safely.

1318
01:38:56,410 --> 01:38:58,000
-什么  -那你呢
- What? - What about you?

1319
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:00,430
挑战还要继续
The challenge will have to continue.

1320
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:04,180
特查拉  我们不会离开瓦坎达
T'Challa, we will not leave Wakanda.

1321
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:06,230
我有责任保护你们
It is my duty to keep you safe.

1322
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:08,920
如果他拿到了我们的科技
If he gets control of our technology,

1323
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,790
哪里都不会安全了
nowhere will be safe.

1324
01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:32,600
黑豹不死
The black panther lives.

1325
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:35,880
等到他为瓦坎达的命运而战时
And when he fights for the fate of Wakanda

1326
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:38,200
我也会伴他左右
I will be right there beside him.

1327
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:40,750
我也是
As will I.

1328
01:39:41,570 --> 01:39:42,430
我也加入
I'm in, too.

1329
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,440
怎么了  你会需要全部的帮助
What? You're gonna need all the help you can get.

1330
01:39:49,780 --> 01:39:50,890
你们煽情够了没
Are you done?

1331
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:54,340
够了没
Are you done?

1332
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:58,860
可以让我和姆巴库大人单独谈谈吗
Could you give me and lord M'Baku a moment?

1333
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:08,580
谢谢
Thank you.

1334
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:11,300
我欠你个大人情
I owed you a great debt.

1335
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,030
一命换一命
A life for a life.

1336
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,860
我们两清了
Consider it paid.

1337
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:18,700
请允许我母亲留下
Please allow my mother to stay here.

1338
01:40:19,530 --> 01:40:21,940
她不会有事的  我保证
No harm will come to her. I give you my word.

1339
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:26,060
我还挺需要支军队的
You know, I could use an army as well.

1340
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:27,670
当然了
I bet you could.

1341
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:30,150
但不行
But no.

1342
01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:34,720
我不能让贾巴里人为你的使命送死
I will give no Jabari lives towards your cause.

1343
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:36,170
这是我们的使命
It is our cause.

1344
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:39,070
-这是为了我们所有人  -我们吗
- It is for all of us. - Oh, us'?

1345
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:41,880
你是几世纪来第一个屈尊到此的国王
Us? You are the first king to come here in centuries,

1346
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:46,070
还说什么"我们"
and now you speak of "Us"?

1347
01:40:47,210 --> 01:40:49,510
我无法代表先王们
I cannot speak for past kings.

1348
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:53,220
但此刻  有敌人坐在王座上
But an enemy sits on the throne right now.

1349
01:40:53,670 --> 01:40:55,910
我们都清楚振金的威力
We both know the power of vibranium.

1350
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:59,110
如果杀人魔头拿到了它
If Killmonger gains control of it,

1351
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:01,180
你觉得他会来找谁
who do you think he will come for next?

1352
01:41:07,950 --> 01:41:09,690
我们不会
We will not

1353
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:12,290
帮你的
help you.

1354
01:41:40,890 --> 01:41:42,290
一切就绪
Everything is on schedule.

1355
01:41:42,290 --> 01:41:43,490
探子都已得到消息了吗
Have the spies been alerted?

1356
01:41:43,490 --> 01:41:46,080
是的  有些人抗拒我们的新任务
Yes. Some resistance to our new mission.

1357
01:41:46,210 --> 01:41:47,500
但伦敦  纽约
But the war dogs in London,

1358
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,550
和香港的战士都就绪了
New York and Hong Kong are standing by.

1359
01:41:51,170 --> 01:41:52,420
我们先攻击那里
We'll strike there first.

1360
01:41:52,990 --> 01:41:54,310
其他人会想通的
The others will come around.

1361
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:55,950
看啊
Look at this.

1362
01:41:55,950 --> 01:41:57,350
手持声波炮
A handheld Sonic Cannon,

1363
01:41:57,350 --> 01:41:59,020
足以抵挡一辆坦克
powerful enough to stop a tank...

1364
01:41:59,190 --> 01:42:01,020
金属探测器又探测不到
Untraceable by metal detectors.

1365
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:02,920
而我们有数千支
And we got thousands of them.

1366
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:07,860
世界会清楚地了解我们的本事
The world's gonna find out exactly who we are.

1367
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:40,770
他没死
He lives.

1368
01:42:45,150 --> 01:42:46,900
尼贾达卡
N'jadaka!

1369
01:42:47,990 --> 01:42:48,950
你好啊
Wassup?

1370
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:51,360
我还没认输呢
I never yielded!

1371
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:55,710
你看到了  我也没死
And as you can see, I am not dead!

1372
01:42:56,380 --> 01:42:58,340
挑战已经结束了
All that challenge shit is over with!

1373
01:42:58,390 --> 01:42:59,670
我现在是国王了
I'm the king now!

1374
01:42:59,830 --> 01:43:02,280
让飞机升空  继续任务
Get those planes in the air! Carry out the mission!

1375
01:43:10,610 --> 01:43:12,280
-苏睿  动手  -收到
- Shuri, now. - Copy that.

1376
01:43:15,330 --> 01:43:18,290
走  快走  走啊  罗斯
Go, go, go! Come on, Ross!

1377
01:43:18,290 --> 01:43:20,990
瓦卡比  杀了这小丑
W'Kabi, man, kill this clown.

1378
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:25,140
瓦卡比  挑战还没结束
W'Kabi, the challenge is not complete.

1379
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:30,510
我们怎么办
What will we do?

1380
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:33,110
边境部落
Border tribe!

1381
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:47,730
你
You!

1382
01:43:48,070 --> 01:43:50,400
你的心里满是仇恨
Your heart is so full of hatred...

1383
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,520
你不配做国王
You are not fit to be a king!

1384
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,140
-来啊  -阿由  去帮国王
- Come on! - Ayo, the king!

1385
01:44:14,510 --> 01:44:15,850
盾

1386
01:44:50,690 --> 01:44:52,160
瓦卡比  停下吧
W'Kabi, stop this!

1387
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:54,470
马上停下
Stop this now!

1388
01:44:58,990 --> 01:44:59,910
不
No!

1389
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:31,120
娜吉雅和我会靠这个控制王室飞船
Nakia and I will get control of the royal Talon with this.

1390
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:32,170
那我做什么
So what do I do?

1391
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:33,980
你得驾驶它
You'll have to fly it.

1392
01:45:34,730 --> 01:45:36,660
-什么  -你曾是优秀的飞行员
- What? - You were a great pilot.

1393
01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:38,790
别担心  我会教你的
Don't worry, I'll guide you through it.

1394
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:41,070
就像开飞行摩托一样
It's just like riding a hoverbike.

1395
01:45:41,830 --> 01:45:43,300
什么  你们还有飞行摩托吗
What? You guys have hoverbikes?

1396
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:45,360
娜吉雅  拿那个
Hey, Nakia, take that.

1397
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:48,350
-我不是护卫队的  -穿上吧  那是盔甲
- I'm not a dora. - Just put it on, it's armor!

1398
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:50,510

1400
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:55,240
我不知道该怎么办
Yeah, I don't know what I'm doing with this.

1401
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:56,460
我们指望你了
We're counting on you.

1402
01:46:10,210 --> 01:46:11,640
瓦坎达万岁
Wakanda forever.

我为你弄成美国式的了  上去吧
I made it American style for you. Get in.

1408

快走  别让武器离开瓦坎达境内
Go! We can't let those weapons get beyond Wakanda.

1411
01:47:01,850 --> 01:47:02,970
好  我去了
All right, I'm on it.

1412
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:21,080
锁住
Lock!

1413
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:23,140
压住他
Get him down!

1414
01:47:23,860 --> 01:47:25,090
拿项链
Get the necklace!

1415
01:47:25,580 --> 01:47:27,200
拿项链
Get the necklace!

1416
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,580
瓦坎达万岁
Wakanda forever!

1417

苏睿  我看到它们了  怎么做

Shoot them down, genius!

1419
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:49,290

在他们的游戏里打败他们

一个奥克兰孩子  却相信一个童话

不

1502
01:57:58,460 --> 01:58:00,110
把我葬在海里

陪伴那些为自由而跳船的先祖

因为他们知道  为奴不如赴死

无用谢我
There's nothing to thank me for.

1510

你说要第一次带我来加州的时候

我以为你是指去柯契拉音乐节

1522
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:05,960
或是迪士尼乐园

兄弟  它凭空就冒出来了  你们看见没

让世人看到  地球上的人和国家

你们又跟他玩了吗
