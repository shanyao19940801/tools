{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Turns the legs to jelly.

79
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,170
但我想问问你 结局会如何
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But I ask you, to what end?

80
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,180
畏惧还是逃避
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Dread it, run from it...

81
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,640
命运终会降临
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}destiny arrives all the same.

82
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,680
而现在 它已在眼前
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And now, it's here.

83
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,230
或者我应该说
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Or should I say...

84
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,110
我已在你面前
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am.

85
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,740
你废话太多了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You talk too much.

86
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,820
超能立方
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The Tesseract.

87
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,120
还是你哥哥的人头
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Or your brother's head.

88
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,170
我相信你已经选好了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I assume you have a preference.

89
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,670
噢 当然了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, I do.

90
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,130
想杀就杀吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Kill away.

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,440
够了 住手
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All right, stop!

92
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,240
我们没有超能立方
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We don't have the Tesseract.

93
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,860
它已经在阿斯加德被毁掉了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It was destroyed on Asgard.

94
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,630
你真是史上最差劲的弟弟
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You really are the worst brother.

95
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,720
我向你保证 哥哥
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I assure you, brother...

96
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,800
太阳会再次照耀我们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the sun will shine on us again.

97
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,930
你过于乐观了 阿斯加德人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.

98
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,020
我要声明一点 我不是阿斯加德人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian.

99
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,230
还有一点呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And for another...

100
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,820
我们有浩克
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}we have a Hulk.

101
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,830
让他玩
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Let him have his fun.

102
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,630
天父啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Allfathers...

103
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,720
让黑魔法再一次流经我的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}let the dark magic flow through me one last...

104
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,680
身体吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}time.

105
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,910
你这就不对了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That was a mistake.

106
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,580
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No!

107
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,390
你要为此偿命
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're going to die for that.

108
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,640
嘘
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Shh.

109
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,400
我谦虚的个体
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}My humble personage...

110
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,940
在您的伟大前鞠躬
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}bows before your grandeur.

111
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,910
任何人都不曾享有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No other being has ever had the might...

112
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,950
使用哪怕一颗无限原石的尊崇
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}nay, the nobility...

113
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,710
更不用说两颗了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones.

114
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,630
宇宙臣服于您的掌下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The universe lies within your grasp.

115
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,630
地球上还有两颗原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}There are two more stones on Earth.

116
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,850
我的孩子们啊 去找到它们 给我带回泰坦星
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan.

117
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,510
父亲 我们不会让您失望的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Father, we will not fail you.

118
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,020
请容我打断一下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If I might interject.

119
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,190
如果要去地球 或许你们需要一位导游
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If you're going to Earth, you might want a guide.

120
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,020
我确实在那片舞台上有过演出经历
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I do have a bit of experience in that arena.

121
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,530
你说的是失败的经历吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If you consider failure experience.

122
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,150
我说的是实战经历
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I consider experience experience.

123
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,160
全能的神灭霸啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Almighty Thanos...

124
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,870
我 洛基 阿斯加德的王子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

125
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,880
奥丁之子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Odinson...

126
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,760
约顿海姆的合法继承人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the rightful king of Jotunheim...

127
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,180
恶作剧之神
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}god of mischief...

128
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,680
在此向您献上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}do hereby pledge to you...

129
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,890
我永生的忠诚
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}my undying fidelity.

130
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,940
永生
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Undying?

131
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,950
你应该谨慎措辞
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You should choose your words more carefully.

132
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,930
你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You...

133
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,730
永远不可能成为
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}will never be...

134
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,610
神
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}a god.

135
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,830
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No!

136
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,220
这次你可没有复活的机会了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No resurrections this time.

137
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,030
不 洛基
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No. Loki.

138
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,950
讲真 你一分钱都没有吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Seriously, you don't have any money?

139
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,120
迷恋物质意味着精神空虚
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.

140
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,710
我会转告便利店小哥的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'll tell the guys at the deli.

141
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,710
他们会给你做一个抽象的黑麦火腿三明治
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye.

142
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,710
噢 等等 我好像有200块钱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh. Wait, wait, wait. I think I have 200.

143
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,880
美元吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Dollars?

144
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,800
-卢比 -换算后呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Rupees. - Which is?

145
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,260
呃 一块五
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, buck and a half.

146
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,130
就一块五你还想吃什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What do you want?

147
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,260
我想吃金枪鱼三明治哎
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.

148
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,820
灭霸来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos is coming.

149
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,650
他来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He's coming.

150
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,030
你说谁
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Who?

151
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,170
慢点 慢点 我一字一句地跟你说清楚
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Slow down, slow down. I'll spell it out for you.

152
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,340
你就是在胡言乱语
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're totally rambling.

153
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,250
-不 我没有 -你把我说糊涂了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- No, I'm not. - You lost me.

154
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,710
听着 就是你有没有做过一种梦
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Look, you know how you're having a dream,

155
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,920
梦里你急着想要尿尿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and in the dream you gotta pee.

156
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,090
-继续 -好
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Yeah. - Okay.

157
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,050
然后你就会想 "我的天呐
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And then you're like, "Oh, my God.

158
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,430
没有卫生间 我要怎么办啊"
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}"There's no bathrooms. What am I gonna do?

159
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,720
-"哦 有人在看着呢" -是哦
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- "Oh, someone's watching." - Right.

160
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,760
"我要尿裤子了"
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}"Oh, I'm gonna go in my pants."

161
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,930
然后你从梦中醒来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And then you wake up and in real life

162
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,010
确实想要尿尿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you actually have to pee.

163
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,100
-没错 -有过这样的梦
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Yes. - Yeah.

164
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,310
-嗯 -谁都做过这样的梦
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Okay. - Everybody has that.

165
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,350
没错 这就是我要说的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Right, that's the point I'm trying to make.

166
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,360
恰恰就是昨晚 我梦见我们有了孩子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Apropos of that, last night I dreamt we had a kid.

167
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,480
感觉太真实了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It was so real.

168
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,030
我们用你怪叔叔的名字给他取名
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We named him after your eccentric uncle.

169
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,150
呃 他叫什么来着
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, what was his name?

170
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,490
-哎 -摩根 对
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Right. - Morgan! Morgan.

171
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,320
-所以你一觉醒来 -自然醒
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- So you woke up... - Naturally.

172
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,120
觉得我们应该
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}...and thought that we were...

173
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,280
-生个孩子 -好吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Expecting. - Yeah.

174
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,160
-可以吗 -不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Yes? - No.

175
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,000
我做了这个梦 那么真实
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I had a dream about it. It was so real.

176
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
如果你真的想要孩子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If you wanted to have a kid...

177
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,080
就不会天天戴着这个了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you wouldn't have done that.

178
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,130
既然你提起来了 我可以跟你说 这没什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing.

179
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,790
只是个放纳米颗粒的东西罢了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's just a housing unit for nanoparticles.

180
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,170
你这么说可一点帮助都没有 好吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're not helping your case, okay?

181
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,420
不 这是可以拆掉的 这不是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, this is detachable. It's not a...

182
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,260
你不需要这个
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You don't need that.

183
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,380
我知道 我做过手术了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I know, I had the surgery.

184
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,800
我只是想保护你我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm just trying to protect us...

185
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,430
和未来的一家三口 仅此而已
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and future usses and that's it.

186
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,140
万一衣柜里面有个怪物呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Just in case there's a monster in the closet.

187
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,100
-而不是 你懂的 -正常的衣服
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Instead of, you know... - Shirts.

188
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,270
你真的太了解我了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know me so well.

189
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,480
-天呐 -你把我要说的话都说了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- God. - You finish all my sentences.

190
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,360
你的衣柜里应该挂满正常的衣服
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You should have shirts in your closet.

191
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,530
是呀
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah.

192
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,440
你知道还差什么吗 不再有意外
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know what there should be? No more surprises.

193
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,950
我们今晚要共进晚餐
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight.

194
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,070
去炫耀一下这枚海瑞温斯顿的钻戒
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Show off this Harry Winston.

195
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,490
对吧 我们不要再经历任何意外了 永远不要
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever.

196
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,830
我应该向你保证
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I should promise you.

197
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,080
-是的 -我会的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Yes. - I will.

198
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,540
谢谢你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thank you.

199
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,750
托尼·史塔克
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tony Stark.

200
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,000
我是斯蒂芬·斯特兰奇博士 你得跟我走一趟
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me.

201
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,840
噢 对了 顺便祝你们新婚快乐
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way.

202
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,800
不好意思 我给你发过请帖吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sorry, you giving out tickets to something?

203
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,970
我们需要你的帮助
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We need your help.

204
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,510
毫不夸张地说
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's not overselling it to say that

205
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,310
宇宙的命运现在悬于一线
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the fate of the universe is at stake.

206
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,850
"我们"是谁
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And who's "We"?

207
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,810
嘿 托尼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey, Tony.

208
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:12,940
布鲁斯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Bruce.

209
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,440
-佩珀 -嗨
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Pepper. - Hi.

210
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,150
-噢 -你还好吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Oh. - You okay?

211
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,200
在宇宙形成之初
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}At the dawn of the universe,

212
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,160
世界一片混沌 之后
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}there was nothing. Then...

213
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,330
嘭
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Boom.

214
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,910
宇宙大爆炸形成了六颗元素水晶
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals...

215
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,790
划过原始的宇宙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}hurtling across the virgin universe.

216
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,340
这些无限原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}These Infinity Stones

217
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,260
每一颗控制着一种本质的力量
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}each control an essential aspect of existence.

218
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,380
空间
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Space.

219
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,800
现实
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Reality.

220
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,430
力量
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Power.

221
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,930
灵魂
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Soul.

222
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,180
心灵
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Mind.

223
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,310
还有时间
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And Time.

224
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,240
再跟我说一遍他的名字
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tell me his name again.

225
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,570
灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos.

226
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,080
他就是灾难 托尼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He's a plague, Tony.

227
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,080
他侵略了无数星球 烧杀掠夺
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He invades planets. He takes what he wants.

228
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,330
他灭掉了一半的人口
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He wipes out half the population.

229
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,580
是他让洛基来的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He sent Loki.

230
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,540
纽约的那次袭击 他就是始作俑者
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The attack on New York, that's him.

231
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,300
原来如此
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This is it.

232
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,420
我们还有多少时间
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What's our timeline?

233
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,010
不知道 他已经拥有了力量和空间原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones.

234
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,930
这让他成了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That already makes him

235
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,640
全宇宙最为强大的人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the strongest creature in the whole universe.

236
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,180
如果他得到了六颗原石 托尼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If he gets his hands on all six stones, Tony...

237
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,310
他可以摧毁任何生命
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He could destroy life

238
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,480
规模之大我们无法想象
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

239
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,480
你竟然也会说"无法想象"
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Did you seriously just say "Hitherto undreamt of"?

240
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,650
你竟然靠着宇宙大锅在拉筋
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

241
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,270
你说这是什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Is that what it is?

242
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,990
我宽宏大量不跟你计较
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm going to allow that.

243
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,620
如果灭霸要集齐六颗原石 那我们为什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just

244
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,240
不把你的这颗毁了呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}stick this one down a garbage disposal?

245
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,450
这绝不可行
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No can do.

246
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,290
我们曾立誓用生命守护时间原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone with our lives.

247
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,540
我还立誓要戒了冰激凌呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And I swore off dairy...

248
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,170
谁知道后来班杰瑞用我的名字命名了一款口味
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}but then Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me.

249
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,670
-史塔克狂热榛仁 -味道不错啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Stark Raving Hazelnuts. - Not bad.

250
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,290
有点腻了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A bit chalky.

251
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,090
大块浩克热巧克力是我们的最爱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A Hunk of Hulk of Burning Fudge is our favorite.

252
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,260
-真有这个东西 -随你便吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- That's a thing? - Whatever.

253
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,340
重点是 事情已经变了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Point is, things change.

254
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,470
我们保护时间原石的誓言是不会变的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change.

255
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,640
而且这颗原石可能是我们对付灭霸的唯一有利机会
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And this stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.

256
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,510
是啊 但是反过来说
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, so conversely,

257
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,640
如果我们不做好本职工作
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}it may also be his best chance against us.

258
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,310
这也可能是他对付我们的最好机会
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Well, if we don't do our jobs.

259
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,350
话说你到底是做什么的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What is your job exactly?

260
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,060
除了捏个动物气球以外
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Besides making balloon animals.

261
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,940
保护你们的现世 混球
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Protecting your reality, douchebag.

262
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,480
好了 各位 我们能不能先不吵架
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay, guys. Could we table this discussion right now?

263
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,440
好在我们有一颗原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The fact is we have this stone.

264
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,150
我们知道它在哪儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We know where it is.

265
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,570
幻视戴着心灵原石还不知道在哪儿呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone...

266
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,330
我们得尽快找到他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and we have to find him now.

267
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,580
我说的就是这件事
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, that's the thing.

268
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,580
什么意思
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What do you mean?

269
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,120
两周前 幻视关闭了他的通讯器
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder.

270
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,290
他失踪了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He's offline.

271
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,630
-什么 -你没听错
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- What? - Yeah.

272
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,670
托尼 你又弄丢了一个超级机器人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tony, you lost another super-bot?

273
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,210
我没有弄丢 他也不是机器人 他在进化
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.

274
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,590
那谁能找到幻视
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Who could find Vision then?

275
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,340
该死
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Shit.

276
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,470
或许史蒂夫·罗杰斯可以
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Probably Steve Rogers.

277
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,600
噢 真好
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, great.

278
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,350
我是说可能
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Maybe.

279
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,020
但是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But...

280
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,520
给他打电话啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Call him.

281
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,610
没有你想得那么容易
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's not that easy.

282
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,570
天啊 我们是不是太久没见了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?

283
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,650
不是啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No.

284
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,360
复仇者联盟解散了 我们玩完了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The Avengers broke up. We're toast.

285
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,160
解散
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Broke up?

286
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,120
你是说像乐队一样 就像披头士
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Like a band? Like... Like the Beatles?

287
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,040
队长和我吵得很凶
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Cap and I fell out hard.

288
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,210
我们已经不说话了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We're not on speaking terms.

289
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,170
托尼 听我说
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tony, listen to me.

290
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,500
索尔已经死了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thor's gone.

291
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,300
灭霸正在来的路上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos is coming.

292
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,180
你跟谁说不说话已经不重要了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.

293
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
破翻盖手机
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Flip phone.

294
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,720
博士 不会是你自己
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be

295
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,050
让头发动的吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}moving your hair, would ya?

296
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,220
这会儿不是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not at the moment, no.

297
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,630
你没事吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You okay?

298
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,840
-帮帮他 -班纳
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Help him! - Banner!

299
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,630
-王 快点 -快 快 这里交给我们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Wong! Look alive! - Go, go! We got it!

300
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,720
星期五 这是什么情况
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Friday, what am I looking at?

301
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,340
暂不确定 我正在查
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not sure. I'm working on it.

302
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,430
嘿 你最好把那个时间原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone

303
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,760
放进后面的口袋里 博士
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}in your back pocket, Doc!

304
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,140
我最好还是用上它
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Might wanna use it.

305
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,840
内德 嘿 你转移一下大家的注意力
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.

306
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,590
我勒个去
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Holy shit.

307
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,300
我们死定了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We're all gonna die!

308
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,590
天上有个宇宙飞船
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}There's a spaceship!

309
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,430
-怎么回事 -哦 天啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- What's going on? - Oh, my God!

310
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,150
你们这帮孩子是咋回事
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What's the matter with you kids?

311
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,770
没见过宇宙飞船是咋滴
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You never seen a spaceship before?

312
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,500
星期五 疏散四十三大街南段的所有人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd Street.

313
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,660
通知应急救援
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Notify first responders.

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hear me and rejoice.

316
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,950
你们是即将
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You are about to die

317
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,240
死于灭霸之子手下的人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}at the hands of the Children of Thanos.

318
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,830
要心存感激
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Be thankful...

319
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,750
你们这些渺小的生命是在做贡献
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}that your meaningless lives are now contributing...

320
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,710
不好意思 地球今天不营业
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.

321
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,590
你赶紧打包滚吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You better pack it up and get outta here.

322
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,670
原石守护者
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stonekeeper.

323
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,220
这个多嘴怪是在替你说话吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Does this chattering animal speak for you?

324
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,390
当然不是了 我自己有嘴
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Certainly not. I speak for myself.

325
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,760
你非法入侵了这个星球的这个城市
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're trespassing in this city and on this planet.

326
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,430
他的意思是让你赶紧滚 章鱼哥
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He means get lost, Squidward.

327
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,640
他真让我心累
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He exhausts me.

328
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,730
把原石给我拿过来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Bring me the stone.

329
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,770
班纳 你想变个身玩玩吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Banner, you want a piece?

330
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,320
呃 不 不太想
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Mmm, no, not really.

331
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,690
不过你们也没在乎过我的想法
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But when do I ever get what I want?

332
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:15,690
这就对了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's right.

333
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,740
好了 来吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay. Push!

334
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,450
有一阵没见了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's been a while.

335
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,990
你能回来帮忙真好 兄弟
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's gonna be good to have you, buddy.

336
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,160
好了 闭嘴
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay. Shh.

337
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,990
让我 我需要集中精神
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Let me just... I need to concentrate here for a second.

338
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,500
来吧 加把劲
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come on, come on, man.

339
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,710
天啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}God!

340
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,250
你的大伙伴呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where's your guy?

341
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,960
我不知道 我们之间好像有点小矛盾
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I don't know. We've sorta been having a thing.

342
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,340
-可没时间闹小矛盾了 -我知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- It's no time for a thing. - I know.

343
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,760
集中精力看着那边的那个东西
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's the thing right there. Let's go.

344
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,100
老哥 你让我在巫师面前丢脸了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.

345
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,350
托尼 抱歉 不是我不行就是他不想
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tony, I'm sorry. Either I can't or he won't.

346
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,310
没事
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's okay.

347
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,850
你退后吧 麻烦你照顾一下他 谢谢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey, stand down. Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

348
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,310
-我罩他 -该死
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- I have him. - Damn it.

349
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,340
这玩意从哪儿冒出来的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where'd that come from?

350
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,430
这是纳米技术
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's nanotech.

351
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,470
你喜欢吗 是我最近在
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You like it? A little something I...

352
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,600
班纳博士 如果你的小绿人朋友
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Doctor Banner, if the rest of your green friend

353
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,810
不打算加入我们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}won't be joining us...

354
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,820
得赶紧把原石送走
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gotta get that stone outta here, now.

355
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,320
石在我在
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It stays with me.

356
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,320
正是如此 再见
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Exactly. Bye.

357
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,420
托尼 你没事吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tony, you okay?

358
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,460
-怎么样了 赢面大不大 -挺好的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- How we doing? Good? Bad? - Really, really good.

359
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,670
赢面挺大 你打算出手相助吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Really good. Do you plan on helping out?

360
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,920
我尽力了 他就是不出来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm trying. He won't come out.

361
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,880
小心铁锤
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hammer.

362
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,730
快出来 浩克 你这样算什么啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come on, Hulk! What are you doing to me?

363
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,980
快出来 快出来 快出来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come out! Come out! Come out!

364
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,360
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No!

365
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,860
"不"是什么意思
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What do you mean, "No"?

366
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,540
嘿 史塔克先生 这是什么情况
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?

367
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,370
-小子 你从哪儿冒出来的 -我正在去现代美术馆参观的路上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Kid, where'd you come from? - A field trip to MoMA.

368
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,750
这家伙是什么情况 史塔克先生
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, what is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?

369
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,750
他是从宇宙来的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, he's from space.

370
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,010
他是来偷走巫师的项链的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.

371
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,580
你的把戏真有趣
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Your powers are quaint.

372
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,410
你肯定很受小孩子欢迎
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You must be popular with children.

373
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,120
这是个很简单的咒语 但很难解除
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.

374
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,590
那我就用你的死来破咒
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Then I'll take it off your corpse.

375
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:37,560
要破解死人的咒语可不容易
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You'll find removing a dead man's spell troublesome.

376
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,190
那就让你生不如死
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You'll only wish you were dead.

377
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,490
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No!

378
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,160
小家伙 那就是巫师 去救他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.

379
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,790
这就去
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}On it!

380
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,630
你真阴
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not cool.

381
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,850
接到你了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gotcha!

382
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,010
等一下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wait!

383
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,860
史塔克先生 我要被吸上去了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, Mr. Stark, I'm being beamed up.

384
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,110
坚持住 小子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hang on, kid.

385
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,840
王 你一定要来参加我的婚礼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wong, you're invited to my wedding.

386
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,600
给我加点料 星期五
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Give me a little juice, Friday.

387
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,940
发射17A
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Unlock 17A.

388
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,710
彼得 你快放手 我会接住你的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.

389
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,080
但你说要我救那个巫师
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But you said save the wizard!

390
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,210
我不能呼吸了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I can't breathe.

391
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,050
我们飞得太高了 你会缺氧的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We're too high up. You're running out of air.

392
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,220
是哦 有道理
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah. That makes sense.

393
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,740
史塔克先生 这闻着像一辆新车
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!

394
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,740
旅途愉快 小子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Happy trails, kid.

395
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,160
-星期五 送他回家 -好的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Friday, send him home. - Yep.

396
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,700
别啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, come on!

397
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,170
老板 波兹小姐来电
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.

398
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,210
托尼 我的天
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tony? Oh, my God.

399
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,250
你还好吗 出了什么事情
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Are you all right? What's going on?

400
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,340
我没事 我只是在想
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, I'm fine. I just think

401
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,170
我们八点半的约会可能要推迟了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}we might have to push our 8:30 res.

402
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,300
为什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Why?

403
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,970
我就是可能
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Just 'cause I'll probably

404
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,600
短时间内赶不回去了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}not make it back for a while.

405
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,850
告诉我你没在那艘船上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tell me you're not on that ship.

406
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,100
我在
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah.

407
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,310
天呐 不 拜托你告诉我你没在那艘船上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}God, no, please tell me you're not on the ship.

408
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,100
亲爱的 我很抱歉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Honey, I'm sorry.

409
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,140
对不起 我不知道该说什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.

410
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,850
回来 托尼 我发誓
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come back here, Tony. I swear to God.

411
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,020
-佩珀 -你马上回来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Pep. - Come back here right now.

412
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,070
回来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come back.

413
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,820
老板 我们失去信号了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Boss, we're losing her.

414
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,280
我也快没信号了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm going too.

415
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,750
老天
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, my God!

416
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,090
我应该留在校车上的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I shoulda stayed on the bus.

417
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,100
你要去哪里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where you going?

418
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,730
时间原石被夺走了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The Time Stone's been taken.

419
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,650
圣所现在无人看守
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The Sanctum remains unguarded.

420
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,730
你接下来要怎么做
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What will you do?

421
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,110
我要打个电话
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm gonna make a call.

422
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,690
大声唱 德拉克斯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Sing it, Drax!

423
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,790
我们怎么又在干这事
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Why are we doing this again?

424
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,380
那是个求救信号 火箭
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's a distress signal, Rocket.

425
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,710
有人可能要死了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Someone could be dying.

426
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,880
我知道 但我们为什么要去救人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I get that, but why are we doing it?

427
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,880
因为我们人美心善
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}'Cause we're nice.

428
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,920
而且不管那人是谁
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And maybe whoever it is

429
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,800
有可能会给我们点小报酬
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}will give us a little cheddar cheese for our effort.

430
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,220
-那不是重点 -那不是重点
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Which isn't the point. - Which isn't the point.

431
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,100
我是说 如果他没钱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I mean, if he doesn't pony up...

432
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,270
我们就占了他的船
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We take his ship.

433
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,060
-没错 -正确
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Exactly! - Bingo!

434
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,060
就这么决定了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All right!

435
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,230
我们要到了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We are arriving.

436
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,270
好了 守护者们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All right, Guardians,

437
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,730
不要忘记前方或许有危险
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}don't forget this might be dangerous...

438
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,940
所以我们要先摆出一副恶人脸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}so let's put on our mean faces.

439
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,870
格鲁特 马上把那玩意儿放下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Groot, put that thing away, now.

440
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,910
我不想再说第二遍
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I don't wanna tell you again.

441
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,160
格鲁特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Groot.

442
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,330
我是格鲁特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am Groot!

443
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,410
-哇哦 -注意用词
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Whoa! - Language!

444
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,040
-嘿 -哇
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Hey! - Wow.

445
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,920
你翅膀硬了啊 小子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You got some acorns on you, kid.

446
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,420
自从你长大了一点
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Ever since you got a little sap,

447
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,380
就是个十足的小混蛋
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you're a total d-hole.

448
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,760
你要是继续玩 我就把那玩意砸个粉碎
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna smash that thing to pieces.

449
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,140
出了什么事情
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What happened?

450
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,440
天呐
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, my God.

451
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,950
看来我们是得不到报酬了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Looks like we're not getting paid.

452
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,240
开雨刷 开雨刷
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wipers! Wipers!

453
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,450
把那东西刷下去
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Get it off.

454
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:35,130
这小子究竟是怎么活下来的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How the hell is this dude still alive?

455
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,130
他不是个小子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He is not a dude.

456
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,010
你才是小子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're a dude.

457
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,340
他 他是个男人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This... This is a man.

458
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,300
一个英俊潇洒 肌肉发达的男人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A handsome, muscular man.

459
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,350
我肌肉发达啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm muscular.

460
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,430
得了吧 奎尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But who are you kidding, Quill?

461
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,970
你就是块五花肉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're one sandwich away from fat.

462
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:49,980
呵呵
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, right.

463
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,520
是真的 奎尔 你最近胖了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's true, Quill. You have put on weight.

464
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,730
什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What?

465
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,820
卡魔拉 你也觉得我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gamora, do you think I'm...

466
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:02,860
他很焦虑 愤怒
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He is anxious, angry.

467
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,490
他痛失了很多 心怀愧疚
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He feels tremendous loss and guilt.

468
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:09,330
他就像是海盗和天使生的孩子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.

469
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,330
哇哦
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wow.

470
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,500
这一句还真是敲醒了我 好吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay.

471
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,420
我要买台跑步机 说到做到
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit.

472
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,500
我还要买哑铃
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

473
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,130
哑铃是不能吃的 好吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?

474
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,340
他的肌肉就像是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's like his muscles

475
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,420
用科塔蒂金属纤维造成的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}are made of Cotati metal fibers.

476
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,180
别再摸他的肌肉了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stop massaging his muscles.

477
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,010
叫醒他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wake him up.

478
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,350
醒醒
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wake.

479
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,990
你们是谁
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Who the hell are you guys?

480
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,460
我认识灭霸这么久 他一直就只有一个目标
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal.

481
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,290
通过消除宇宙一半的生命
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}To bring balance to the universe

482
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,380
来维持宇宙的平衡
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}by wiping out half of all life.

483
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,590
他曾经一个星球接一个星球地杀人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He used to kill people planet by planet,

484
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,340
一次又一次的大屠杀
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}massacre by massacre.

485
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,970
包括我的星球
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Including my own.

486
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,550
他要是得到了六颗原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If he gets all six Infinity Stones...

487
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,930
他打个响指就能除掉一半的人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}he can do it with the snap of his fingers like this.

488
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,560
你似乎很了解灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.

489
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,400
卡魔拉是灭霸的女儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gamora is the daughter of Thanos.

490
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,490
你父亲杀死了我弟弟
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Your father killed my brother.

491
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,240
真狗血啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, boy.

492
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,120
严格来讲 是养女
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stepfather, technically.

493
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,080
她跟你一样恨灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And she hates him as much as you do.

494
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,410
家家有本难念的经
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Families can be tough.

495
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,920
我父亲死之前
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Before my father died,

496
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,670
他告诉我 我有个同父异母的姐姐
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}he told me that I had a half-sister...

497
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,210
他把她关在地狱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}that he imprisoned in Hel.

498
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,300
然后她回家了 戳瞎了我的眼睛
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And then she returned home and stabbed me in the eye.

499
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,670
所以我不得不杀了她
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So I had to kill her.

500
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,970
我想生活就是这样 不是吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's life though, isn't it, I guess.

501
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,180
冤冤相报何时了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Goes round and round and...

502
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,180
我懂你的难处
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I feel your pain.

503
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,560
我也懂你的难处 因为
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I feel your pain as well, because...

504
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,930
我是说 虽然我不想跟你们比较
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I mean, it's not a competition,

505
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,190
但我也过得很惨
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}but I've been through a lot.

506
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,060
我爸爸杀了我妈妈
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}My father killed my mother.

507
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,230
然后我又杀了我爸爸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And then I had to kill my father.

508
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,940
真的很难
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That was hard.

509
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,280
可能比杀死姐姐要难一点
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Probably even harder than having to kill a sister.

510
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,320
至少我的眼睛都还在 所以
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Plus, I came out with both my eyes, which was...

511
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,120
我要的是锤子 不是汤勺
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I need a hammer, not a spoon.

512
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:14,450
我要怎么启动这东西 有没有密码之类的 呃
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of, uh...

513
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,160
四位数的密码 有可能是生日
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A four-digit code, maybe? Maybe a birthdate.

514
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,540
-你在做什么 -开走你们的分离舱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Uh, what are you doing? - Taking your pod.

515
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,880
不 不可以
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, you're not.

516
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:29,470
我不允许你驾驶我们的分离舱 先生
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You will not be taking our pod today, sir.

517
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,970
额 奎尔 你是故意把你的声音压低吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh... Quill, are you making your voice deeper?

518
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,560
-没有 -你有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- No. - You are.

519
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,480
你在模仿那位男神 很怪
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.

520
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,940
没有 我没有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, I'm not.

521
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,980
-他又模仿了一次 -我的声音本来就这样
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- He just did it again! - This is my voice.

522
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,490
你是在嘲笑我吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Are you mocking me?

523
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,990
-你是在嘲笑我吗 -够了 你又在学我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Are you mocking me? - Stop it. You did it again.

524
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,080
他在模仿我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He's trying to copy me.

525
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,200
你最好别再学我说话
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I need you to stop doing that.

526
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,040
-够了 -是他先开始的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Enough! - He's doing it first.

527
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,500
我们要阻止灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We need to stop Thanos.

528
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,170
也就是说 我们需要搞清楚
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Which means we need to find out

529
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,330
他下一步是去哪里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}where he's going next.

530
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,670
虚无知地[哪儿也不去]
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Knowhere.

531
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,500
他肯定是要去什么地方的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He must be going somewhere.

532
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,670
不是吧 虚无知地
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, no. Knowhere?

533
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,510
那是个地名 我们去过 那地方太烂了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's a place. We've been there. It sucks.

534
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,390
-不好意思 那是我们的食物 -现在是我的了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Excuse me, that's our food. - Not anymore.

535
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:16,680
索尔 他为什么要去虚无知地
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thor, why would he go to Knowhere?

536
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,140
因为现实原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Because for years...

537
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,310
安全无恙地被寄放在那里好几年了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the Reality Stone's been safely stored there

538
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,980
在一个叫收藏者的人手里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}with a man called the Collector.

539
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,610
如果是在收藏者手里 那就不安全了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe.

540
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,520
蠢货才会把原石交给他呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Only an idiot would give that man a stone.

541
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,150
-天才也会 -你怎么知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Or a genius. - How do you know...

542
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,700
他不会去找其他原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}he's not going for one of the other stones?

543
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,320
无限原石一共有六颗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}There are six stones out there.

544
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,660
灭霸上星期毁灭山达尔星时
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos already has the Power Stone...

545
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,450
从那里得到了力量原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}because he stole it last week when he decimated Xandar.

546
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,620
他毁了我的船
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He stole the Space Stone from me...

547
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,500
屠杀了我一半的子民 又从我手上夺走了空间原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people.

548
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,250
时间原石和心灵原石在地球上很安全
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.

549
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,500
由复仇者联盟守护着
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They're with the Avengers.

550
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,050
-复仇者联盟 -地球上最强大的英雄们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- The Avengers? - Earth's mightiest heroes.

551
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,300
像凯文·贝肯那样的吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Like Kevin Bacon?

552
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,590
他可能也是队里一员吧 我不知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He may be on the team. I don't know.

553
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,680
我很久没去地球了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I haven't been there in a while.

554
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,220
至于灵魂原石 没人见过这颗原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that.

555
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,060
也没人知道它在哪里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No one even knows where it is.

556
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,720
因此灭霸得不到这颗原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Therefore Thanos can't get it.

557
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,430
所以他会先去虚无知地
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Therefore he's going to Knowhere.

558
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:03,100
因为他要去找现实原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hence he'll be getting the Reality Stone.

559
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,270
不用谢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're welcome.

560
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,560
那我们现在就得去虚无知地
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Then we have to go to Knowhere now.

561
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,690
不对 我们要去的地方是尼德威阿尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wrong. Where we have to go is Nidavellir.

562
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,700
-这词是你编的吧 -所有词都是编的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- That's a made-up word. - All words are made up.

563
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,070
真有尼德威阿尔这个地方 没开玩笑吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

564
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,740
那地方是一个传奇
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That place is a legend.

565
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,330
他们制造出最强大 最可怕的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They make the most powerful, horrific weapons

566
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,500
让整个宇宙都饱受折磨的武器
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to ever torment the universe.

567
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,670
我倒是很想去一下这地方
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I would very much like to go there, please.

568
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,750
这只兔子说得对
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The rabbit is correct

569
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,830
很明显他是你们之中最聪明的了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and clearly the smartest among you.

570
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,880
兔子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Rabbit?

571
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,550
只有矮人伊特里能打造出我需要的武器
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Only Eitri the Dwarf can make me the weapon I need.

572
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,840
我想你就是队长吧 先生
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I assume you're the captain, sir.

573
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,170
好眼力
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're very perceptive.

574
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,380
你看着像是个道德高尚的好队长
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You seem like a noble leader.

575
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,220
你愿意和我一起去探访尼德威阿尔吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?

576
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,180
请让我请示一下我们的队长 等等 我就是队长
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Let me just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me!

577
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,100
-没问题 我去 -很好
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Yeah. I'll go. - Wonderful!

578
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,270
呃 我才是队长
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, except for that I'm the captain.

579
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,480
奎尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Quiet.

580
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,140
-那是我的背包 -去坐好
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- That's my backpack. - Go sit down.

581
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,770
听着 这是我的飞船
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Look, this is my ship.

582
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:47,570
我不会去
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And I'm not goin' to...

583
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,780
等等 我们在说什么武器来着
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wait, what kinda weapon are we talkin' about here?

584
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,860
能杀死灭霸的那种
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The Thanos-killing kind.

585
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,570
你不觉得那样的武器我们应该人手一把吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?

586
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,780
不觉得 你力气不够 驾驭不了那样的武器
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No. You simply lack the strength to wield them.

587
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,070
当你的精神不稳定时
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Your bodies would crumble

588
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,370
你的身体会不堪一击
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}as your minds collapsed into madness.

589
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,410
你这么一说我更想试试了 是不是很奇怪
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?

590
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,700
是有点奇怪
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

591
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,160
如果我们不去虚无知地
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If we don't go to Knowhere

592
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,790
让灭霸再得到一颗原石的话
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and Thanos retrieves another stone...

593
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,540
那他会强大得无法阻止
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}he'll be too powerful to stop.

594
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,790
-他已经是了 -我想到办法了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- He already is. - I got it figured out.

595
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,630
我们有两艘船
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We got two ships

596
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,260
和一大群蠢货
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and a large assortment of morons.

597
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,590
那么 我和格鲁特跟着海盗天使走
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So me and Groot will go with the pirate angel here.

598
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,800
剩下的蠢货去虚无知地
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And the morons will go to Knowhere

599
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,600
试着阻止灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to try to stop Thanos.

600
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,680
-同意吗 同意 -非常同意
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Cool? Cool. - So cool.

601
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,730
郑重声明
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}For the record...

602
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,270
我知道你之所以跟他走
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I know that you're going with him

603
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,440
是因为那里没有灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}because it's where Thanos isn't.

604
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,100
你知道的 你真的不该
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know, you really shouldn't

605
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,230
这样跟你的队长说话 奎尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}talk that way to your captain, Quill.

606
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,900
走吧 格鲁特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come on, Groot.

607
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,740
别玩游戏了 脑子都玩坏了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Put that game down. You'll rot your brain.

608
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:41,450
就此告别 祝你们好运 蠢货们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I bid you farewell and good luck, morons.

609
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,540
拜
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Bye.

610
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,840
幻视
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Vis?

611
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,890
原石又有反映了吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Is it the stone again?

612
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,600
它好像在跟我说些什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's as if it's speaking to me.

613
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,810
它说了什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What does it say?

614
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,270
我不 我不知道 但确实想要告诉我什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I don't... I don't know, but something.

615
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,650
嘿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey.

616
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,120
告诉我 你感受到了什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tell me what you feel.

617
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,710
我只感受到了你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I just feel you.

618
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,890
十点钟有班车去格拉斯哥
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So there's a 10:00 a.M. To Glasgow...

619
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:46,230
这样在你回去之前 我们能多待一会儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}which would give us more time together before you went back.

620
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,730
万一我错过那班车怎么办
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What if I miss that train?

621
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:48,850
十一点还有一班
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}There's an 11:00.

622
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,400
如果我错过了所有的班车呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What if I missed all the trains?

623
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,610
如果我这次去了就回不来呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What if this time I didn't go back?

624
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,190
但你已经答应史塔克了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But you gave Stark your word.

625
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,360
我宁愿承诺于你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'd rather give it to you.

626
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,570
你知道的 也有人在等着我回去的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Well, there are people who are expecting me too, you know.

627
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,990
我们都做出了承诺
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We both made promises.

628
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,740
但不是对彼此
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not to each other.

629
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,240
旺达
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wanda.

630
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,660
两年了 我们偷得这些许时光
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}For two years, we've stolen these moments...

631
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,830
试着证明我们俩之间有可能
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}trying to see if this could work and...

632
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,630
我不知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I don't know.

633
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,670
你知道的 我只是想为我自己说几句
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself.

634
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,630
我想
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I think...

635
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,840
-有可能的 -有可能的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- It works. - It works.

636
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,260
有可能的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It works.

637
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,840
留下吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stay.

638
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,510
别离开我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stay with me.

639
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:32,520
或者不留也行 可能是我太心急了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Or not. If I'm overstepping...

640
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,610
他们是什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What are they?

641
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,950
是原石要传达给我的警告
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What the stone was warning me about.

642
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,460
我得走了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I have to go.

643
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,960
不 幻视
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, Vision.

644
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,420
幻视 如果是真的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Vision, if that's true,

645
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,260
那么离开或许不是好主意
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}then maybe going isn't the best idea.

646
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,510
旺达 我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wanda, I...

647
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,550
幻视
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Vision!

648
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:37,340
那刀 封住了我的力量
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The blade, it stopped me from phasing.

649
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,300
-这有可能吗 -本来是不可能的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Is that even possible? - It isn't supposed to be.

650
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,880
我的系统开始失灵了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}My systems are failing.

651
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,640
我觉得我们当初真应该待在床上的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm beginning to think we should have stayed in bed.

652
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,270
幻视
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Vis!

653
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,690
交出原石 我就饶她一命
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Give up the stone, and she lives.

654
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:40,900
放开他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hands off.

655
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,080
来 快点
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come on. Come on.

656
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,040
加油 你得站起来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come on, you gotta get up.

657
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,420
你得站起来 快
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You gotta get up. Come on. Hey.

658
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,130
我们得赶紧走
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey. We have to go.

659
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,550
求你了 求你快走吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Please. Please leave.

660
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,390
是你让我留下来的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You asked me to stay.

661
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,720
-我哪也不去 -求你了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- I'm staying. - Please.

662
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,800
-起来 -我做不到
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Get up. - I can't.

663
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,680
我们不想赶尽杀绝 但不代表我们不会
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We don't wanna kill you, but we will.

664
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,800
你们绝不会再有可乘之机了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You'll never get the chance again.

665
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,700
你能站起来吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Can you stand?

666
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,580
谢了 队长
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thank you, Captain.

667
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,830
到飞机上再说
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Let's get you on the jet.

668
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:07,300
我以为我们说好了的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Now, I thought we had a deal.

669
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:11,180
不单独行动 及时汇报 不冒险
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stay close, check in, don't take any chances.

670
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,800
对不起
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sorry.

671
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,640
我们只想单独在一起
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We just wanted time.

672
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,600
去哪 队长
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where to, Cap?

673
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,850
回家
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Home.

674
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,650
我们会没事的 会没事的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We'll be safe. We'll be safe.

675
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,220
泽侯贝里族民们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Zehobereians.

676
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,140
妈妈 我的妈妈在哪
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Mother! Where's my mother?

677
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,720
顺我者昌 逆我者亡
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Choose a side or die.

678
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,220
妈妈
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Mother!

679
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,730
一边 是审判日般的灭亡
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}One side is a revelation...

680
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:04,730
而另一边则是鲜为人知的无尚荣耀
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the other an honor known only to a few.

681
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:07,730
怎么了 小家伙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What's wrong, little one?

682
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:11,070
我妈妈不见了 她在哪里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}My mother. Where is my mother?

683
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,070
你叫什么名字
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What's your name?

684
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:20,700
卡魔拉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gamora.

685
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,790
你可真是个小战士 卡魔拉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're quite the fighter, Gamora.

686
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:25,750
来吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come.

687
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,750
让我来帮你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Let me help you.

688
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,270
看
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Look.

689
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,310
很漂亮 对吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Pretty, isn't it?

690
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:51,030
完美的平衡 正是世间万物应有的样子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.

691
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:54,820
如果其中一方过重
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Too much to one side or the other...

692
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,700
给你 你来试试
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Here. You try.

693
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:08,580
你们就安心前往天国 去见造物主吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Now, go in peace to meet your maker.

694
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,840
别看
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh-uh.

695
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,300
专心一点
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Concentrate.

696
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:21,010
看 你已经学会了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}There. You've got it.

697
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,690
卡魔拉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gamora.

698
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,820
你说这些手榴弹是那种炸烂小丁丁型的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Do you know if these grenades

699
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,150
还是瓦斯型的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}are the blow-off-your-junk kind or the gas kind?

700
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,320
因为我在考虑
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Because I was thinking about

701
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,030
挂几个在我的腰带上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}hanging a couple on my belt right here.

702
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,160
但如果这是那种类型就不好了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But I don't want to if they're the...

703
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,370
我想求你帮个忙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I need to ask a favor.

704
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:43,790
当然 说吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, sure.

705
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,330
不管发生什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}One way or another,

706
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:48,750
我们最终肯定会跟灭霸交手
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the path that we're on leads to Thanos.

707
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:52,880
是啊 所以我才准备这些手榴弹
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Which is what the grenades are for.

708
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,170
抱歉跑题了 你要我帮什么忙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, I'm sorry. What's the favor?

709
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:58,630
如果进展不顺
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If things go wrong...

710
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,220
如果灭霸抓到了我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If Thanos gets me...

711
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:08,850
我要你对我保证
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I want you to promise me...

712
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:10,980
你会杀了我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you'll kill me.

713
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:12,770
什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What?

714
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,200
我知道一些他不知道的秘密
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I know something he doesn't.

715
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:23,080
如果被他发现
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And if he finds it out,

716
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,370
整个宇宙都会处于危险之中
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the entire universe could be at risk.

717
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,330
什么秘密
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What do you know?

718
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:28,370
如果我告诉你 你也会知道的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If I tell you, you'd know too.

719
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,340
但如果这件事这么重要
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If it's so important...

720
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,500
我不应该知道吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}shouldn't I?

721
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,670
除非你想自寻死路
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Only if you wanna die.

722
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,670
为什么非得假设有个人会牺牲呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?

723
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,010
你只要
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Just...

724
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,470
相信我 很有可能需要杀了我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Trust me. And possibly kill me.

725
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:48,060
呃 我很乐意
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I mean, I'd like to.

726
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,060
我真的愿意 但你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I really would. But you...

727
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,230
向我发誓
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Swear to me.

728
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,070
以你母亲的名义发誓
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Swear to me on your mother.

729
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,080
好吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay.

730
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,250
我发誓
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay.

731
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:29,560
-噢 -大哥
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Oh. - Dude.

732
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,270
你站在那儿多久了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How long have you been standing there?

733
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:32,270
一个小时
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}An hour.

734
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,110
一个小时
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}An hour?

735
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,110
你是在开玩笑吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Are you serious?

736
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:38,280
我最近掌握了一个技能
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I've mastered the ability

737
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,030
我只要站在这里一动不动
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}of standing so incredibly still...

738
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,870
肉眼就看不到我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}that I become invisible to the eye.

739
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,370
看吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Watch.

740
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:52,330
你不是在吃坚果吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're eating a zarg-nut.

741
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:53,870
但我的动作
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But my movement...

742
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,250
非常之慢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}was so slow...

743
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,130
你们根本感觉不到
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}that it's imperceptible.

744
00:46:59,130 --> 00:46:59,960
呃 并没有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Mmm, no.

745
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,590
我很确定我隐形了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sure I'm invisible.

746
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:03,930
嗨 德拉克斯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hi, Drax.

747
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:07,470
该死
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Damn it.

748
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:29,330
这个地方看起来好荒凉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This place looks deserted.

749
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:32,290
我正在获取第三象限的动态
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm reading movement in the third quadrant.

750
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,210
我也收到了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yep, I'm picking that up too.

751
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,130
我们就在这降落吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Let's put down right here.

752
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:50,350
原石不在我这儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I don't have it.

753
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,310
银河系的所有人都知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Everyone in the galaxy knows

754
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:55,980
你为了自己
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you'd sell your own brother...

755
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,610
哪怕是那一点点的蝇头小利
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}if you thought it would add even the slightest trinket...

756
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:59,520
都不惜出卖自己的亲兄弟
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to your pathetic collection.

757
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,870
我知道你有现实原石 蒂万
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan.

758
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,250
交给我你就不用受折磨
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.

759
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,130
我跟你说过
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I told you.

760
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,960
我已经卖掉了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I sold it.

761
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:26,010
我有什么理由对你说谎呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Why would I lie?

762
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:28,180
我认为说谎对你来说像呼吸一样稀松平常
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I imagine it's like breathing for you.

763
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:30,930
说谎就是找死
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Like suicide.

764
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:33,310
看来你明白我的意思
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You do understand.

765
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:36,440
就算是你 也不愿意白白交出如此珍贵的东西
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not even you would surrender something so precious.

766
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,230
我不知道它的来历
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I didn't know what it was.

767
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:41,230
那你比我想象中的还要愚蠢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Then you're more of a fool than I took you for.

768
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:42,360
就是他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's him.

769
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,980
我再给你最后一次机会 谎话精
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Last chance, charlatan.

770
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,450
原石在哪里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where's the stone?

771
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:48,990
今天
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Today...

772
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,070
德拉克斯 德拉克斯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Drax. Drax.

773
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:52,160
就是你为我的妻女血债血偿的日子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}...he pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.

774
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,200
德拉克斯 等等
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Drax, wait.

775
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,250
还不行 还不是时候
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not yet, not yet, not yet.

776
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,410
德拉克斯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Drax.

777
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,670
德拉克斯 德拉克斯 听我说
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Drax, Drax, Drax. Listen to me.

778
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:06,220
他还没有拿到原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He doesn't have the stone yet.

779
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,590
如果我们能拿到 我们就可以阻止他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If we get it, then we can stop him.

780
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:12,050
首要任务是拿到原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We have to get the stone first. Yeah.

781
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,260
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No.

782
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,640
不 为了奥维特 为了卡马利亚
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

783
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,100
沉睡吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Sleep.

784
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:31,160
好了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay.

785
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:35,240
卡魔拉 曼蒂斯 你们走右边
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

786
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,960
是你们的右边
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The other right.

787
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:03,980
为什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Why?

788
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:18,000
为什么是你 女儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Why you, daughter?

789
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:37,520
真够快的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That was quick.

790
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:48,280
妙极了 真是妙极了 妙极了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!

791
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:53,320
你是在为我难过吗 女儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Is that sadness I sense in you, daughter?

792
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:59,040
我知道 你还是在乎我的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}In my heart, I knew you still cared.

793
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,550
果然还是眼见为实啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But one never knows for sure.

794
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,560
现实总是令人失望
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Reality is often disappointing.

795
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:27,110
它曾是如此
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That is, it was.

796
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:30,440
但如今
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Now...

797
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:35,280
现实由我掌控了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}reality can be whatever I want.

798
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,410
你知道我会来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You knew I'd come.

799
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:40,740
我等着你来呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I counted on it.

800
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:43,710
我们还有些事情要谈 小家伙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}There's something we need to discuss, little one.

801
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,170
灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos!

802
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,680
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No!

803
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,230
放了她 奶昔大哥
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Let her go, Grimace.

804
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:06,230
彼特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Peter.

805
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:08,770
我让你走右边的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I told you to go right.

806
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,900
现在还要跟我争这个
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Now? Really?

807
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,780
放了她
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You let her go!

808
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,650
原来是小男朋友啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Ah, the boyfriend.

809
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:15,780
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No.

810
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,200
我更像是一个
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Like to think of myself

811
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,700
随叫随到 专杀泰坦星人的职业杀手
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}more as a Titan-killing, long-term booty call.

812
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,870
-放了她 -彼特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Let her go. - Peter.

813
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:26,620
不然我就打爆你那螺丝帽一样的下巴
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin right off your face.

814
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:28,710
你要杀的不是他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not him.

815
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,850
你答应过我的 你答应过的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You promised. You promised.

816
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:48,730
噢 女儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, daughter.

817
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:51,320
你对他的期望太高了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You expect too much from him.

818
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,490
是她要求你这样做的 是吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}She's asked, hasn't she?

819
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:01,450
开枪吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Do it.

820
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:06,500
哼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Mmm.

821
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,250
开枪
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Do it!

822
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,380
我让你走右边的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I told you to go right.

823
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:22,350
我爱你胜过一切
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I love you more than anything.

824
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:26,850
我也爱你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I love you too.

825
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,320
我喜欢这小子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I like him.

826
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,940
还没有幻视的消息吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Still no word from Vision?

827
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:18,360
卫星在爱丁堡的某个地方失去了他的信号
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.

828
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,570
他在一辆被盗的昆式战斗机上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}On a stolen Quinjet

829
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:21,660
和四个世界上最高通缉的罪犯一起
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}with four of the world's most wanted criminals.

830
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,370
他们之所以是罪犯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know they're only criminals because

831
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:24,910
都是因为你们 不是吗 长官
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?

832
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:26,040
我的天 罗德斯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}My God, Rhodes.

833
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,660
你比我还能说谎
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Your talent for horseshit rivals my own.

834
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,830
如果不是因为那些协定
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If it weren't for those Accords,

835
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:32,920
幻视现在就在这里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Vision would've been right here.

836
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,300
我可记得那协定上有你的亲笔签名呢 上校
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.

837
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:37,510
这倒没错
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's right.

838
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,720
我也很肯定我为此付出了代价
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And I'm pretty sure I paid for that.

839
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,010
你犹豫了吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You have second thoughts?

840
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:44,760
不再犹豫了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not anymore.

841
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,310
国务卿先生
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Mr. Secretary.

842
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:58,480
你们胆子可真大
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You got some nerve.

843
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:00,860
这是我对你们的评价
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'll give you that.

844
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,660
现在需要胆量的是你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You could use some of that right now.

845
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:06,580
世界现在水深火热
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The world's on fire.

846
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:10,290
你们以为之前的账就此一笔勾销了吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And you think all is forgiven?

847
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:12,080
我不是来寻求原谅的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm not looking for forgiveness.

848
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,380
我也早就不再征求允许了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And I'm way past asking permission.

849
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,750
地球刚刚失去了她最好的守护者
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Earth just lost her best defender.

850
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,920
所以我们是来战斗的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So we're here to fight.

851
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:23,550
如果你想挡我们的道
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And if you wanna stand in our way...

852
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:26,470
我们会把你也拿下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}we'll fight you too.

853
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,680
逮捕他们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Arrest them.

854
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,680
没问题
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All over it.

855
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,820
估计我得上军事法庭了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's a court-martial.

856
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,400
很高兴见到你 队长
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's great to see you, Cap.

857
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:46,370
我也是 罗迪
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You too, Rhodey.

858
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:47,370
嘿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey.

859
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,870
哇 你们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wow. You guys...

860
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,870
看上去真是一团糟
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}really look like crap.

861
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:55,670
这几年过得不怎么样吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Must've been a rough couple years.

862
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:58,790
是啊 又不是天天住五星级酒店
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.

863
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,920
我觉得你们看上去棒极了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, I think you look great.

864
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,470
呃
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh...

865
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:10,010
没错 我回来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, I'm back.

866
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:12,770
嗨 布鲁斯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hi, Bruce.

867
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,400
小娜
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Nat.

868
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,360
尴尬了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This is awkward.

869
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,530
他们一定会回来的是吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?

870
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:29,830
而且他们肯定能找到我们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And they can clearly find us.

871
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:32,410
我们得全员待命 克林特去哪了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?

872
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:33,870
签署协议的那件事以后
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}After the whole Accords situation,

873
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:35,620
他和斯科特都达成了协议 他们要为家庭考虑
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough

874
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,170
现在都被软禁在家里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}on their families. They're on house arrest.

875
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:38,710
-斯科特是谁 -蚁人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Who's Scott? - Ant-Man.

876
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:40,090
我们有了蜘蛛侠又来个蚁人吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?

877
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,050
好了 听着
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay, look.

878
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:45,130
灭霸拥有宇宙中最强大的军队
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos has the biggest army in the universe...

879
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:48,680
他不拿到幻视的原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and he is not gonna stop until he gets...

880
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:51,680
绝不会罢休
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Vision's stone.

881
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,020
那我们必须保护好它
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Then we have to protect it.

882
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,730
不 我们必须毁了它
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, we have to destroy it.

883
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,190
我头顶的这颗原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I've been giving a good deal of thought

884
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,520
我想了很久
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to this entity in my head.

885
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,520
关于它的性质
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}About its nature.

886
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,820
还有它的组成
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But also its composition.

887
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,860
我觉得如果它被暴露在
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I think if it were exposed

888
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,860
一个和它性质相同的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to a sufficiently powerful energy source...

889
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:11,740
无比巨大的能量源之下 也许
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}something very similar to its own signature, perhaps...

890
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:16,000
它的分子完整性将会被破坏
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}its molecular integrity could fail.

891
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,750
是啊 你也一样
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, and you with it.

892
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,460
我是不会同意的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We're not having this conversation.

893
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,550
毁掉这颗原石 是唯一能确保
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Eliminating the stone is the only way

894
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:24,960
灭霸得不到它的方式
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to be certain that Thanos can't get it.

895
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,130
这代价太高了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's too high a price.

896
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,060
只有你有能力付出这个代价
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Only you have the power to pay it.

897
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,600
灭霸正威胁着半个宇宙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos threatens half the universe.

898
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,190
不能让一条生命阻碍我们的行动
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.

899
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:44,730
但确实会
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But it should.

900
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:48,740
我们不拿性命做交换 幻视
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We don't trade lives, Vision.

901
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,870
队长 七十年前 你放弃自己的生命
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life...

902
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:52,830
救了数百万人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to save how many millions of people?

903
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:54,990
告诉我 这两者有什么区别
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tell me, why is this any different?

904
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:57,410
因为你可能还有选择
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Because you might have a choice.

905
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,000
你的大脑
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Your mind is made up

906
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,630
是由一些复杂的覆盖网络构成的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}of a complex construct of overlays.

907
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:06,260
贾维斯 奥创 托尼 我 还有原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Jarvis, Ultron, Tony, me, the stone.

908
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,090
所有这些结合在一起
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All of them mixed together,

909
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:10,010
在你体内取长补短
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}all of them learning from one another.

910
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:11,930
你是说幻视并不只是原石而已吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?

911
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:15,140
我是说如果我们取出原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm saying that if we take out the stone...

912
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,770
还会有很大一部分的幻视存在
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}there's still a whole lot of Vision left.

913
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:18,600
或许还是最精华的部分
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Perhaps the best parts.

914
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,850
我们可以做到吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Can we do that?

915
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,650
我不行 这儿也没有条件
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not me, not here.

916
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:24,150
那你最好快点找到
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Well, you better find someone

917
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:25,610
能做这件事的人和地点
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and somewhere fast.

918
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:26,980
罗斯不可能这么轻易地
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Ross isn't just gonna let you guys

919
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:28,150
放过你们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}have your old rooms back.

920
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,870
我知道一个地方
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I know somewhere.

921
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:48,840
国王护卫队
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The Kingsguard

922
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,220
和女子皇家亲卫队都在待命中
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.

923
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,220
边境部落呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And the Border Tribe?

924
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:54,140
他们留守边境
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Those that are left.

925
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,560
也给贾巴里部落传个话
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Send word to the Jabari as well.

926
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,680
姆巴库喜欢打仗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}M'Baku likes a good fight.

927
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:03,150
那他呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And what of this one?

928
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:05,690
这个人可能已经厌倦了战争
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This one may be tired of war.

929
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:08,730
但是白狼已经休整够了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But the White Wolf has rested long enough.

930
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:32,930
什么时候开战
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where's the fight?

931
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,180
马上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}On its way.

932
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:56,200
我为灭霸做事这么久
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}In all the time I've served Thanos...

933
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,080
从没让他失望过
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I have never failed him.

934
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:08,380
如果原石还镶在
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan...

935
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,090
你这个讨厌的人身上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}with the Time Stone still attached

936
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:12,380
而我却两手空空地回到泰坦星见他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to your vaguely irritating person...

937
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:15,050
那可就说不过去了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}there would be judgment.

938
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:25,140
把原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Give me...

939
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,020
给我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the stone.

940
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:43,950
哇 你还真是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wow, you're a seriously

941
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,160
一件忠心耿耿的披风啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?

942
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,830
呃 说到忠心耿耿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...

943
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:49,210
你怎么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What the...

944
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:50,920
-我知道您要说什么 -你不该来这里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- I know what you're gonna say. - You should not be here.

945
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,920
-我本来要回家的 -我不想听
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- I was gonna go home. - I don't wanna hear it.

946
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,380
但我家那么远 我在半路上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But it was such a long way down and I just thought

947
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:54,260
-想到了您 -现在也不得不听着了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- about you on the way... - And now I gotta hear it.

948
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,340
而且我还被卡在了飞船的一边
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}...and kinda stuck to the side of the ship.

949
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,930
顺便一说 这套战衣好像也感觉到了危险
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way.

950
01:00:57,930 --> 01:00:59,050
该死
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}God damn it.

951
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:02,010
所以 如果非要说的话 其实我在这里也怪你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So, if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.

952
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:03,430
-你说什么 -我收回
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- What did you just say? - I take that back.

953
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:04,980
现在我已经在太空里了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And now, I'm here in space.

954
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:07,650
是啊 就在我最不想让你来的地方
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, right where I didn't want you to be.

955
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:09,860
这不是康尼岛 不是出外勤
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip.

956
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:10,980
这儿可是有去无回
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This is a one-way ticket.

957
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,820
你明白了吗 别假装你已经想清楚了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You hear me? Don't pretend you thought this through.

958
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:13,940
我确实想清楚了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, I did think this through.

959
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,740
你怎么可能想清楚
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You could not have possibly thought this through.

960
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,280
如果整个社区都没了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man...

961
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,950
我如何当个友好的社区蜘蛛侠
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}if there's no neighborhood.

962
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,240
好吧 好像这么说也不对
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay, that didn't really make sense,

963
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,700
但你知道我想表达什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}but you know what I'm trying to say.

964
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:29,710
好吧 我们现在有个状况
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come on. We got a situation.

965
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:30,790
看见下面那个人了吗 他有麻烦了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}See him down there? He's in trouble.

966
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:31,840
你有什么计划吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What's your plan?

967
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:32,960
-说 -呃
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Go. - Um...

968
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:35,300
好吧 好吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay, okay... Uh...

969
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,720
你看过一部非常老的电影吗 叫《异形》
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?

970
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:45,140
很痛苦吧 是不是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Painful, aren't they?

971
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:48,810
这些针最初是在显微外科手术中使用的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They were originally designed for microsurgery.

972
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:50,900
而其中的任意一根
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And any one of them...

973
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:58,820
都能瞬间结束你朋友的生命
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}could end your friend's life in an instant.

974
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:00,450
实话实说 他其实不是我的朋友
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend.

975
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:03,160
救他的命其实只是出于职业素养而已
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Saving his life is more of a professional courtesy.

976
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:07,710
你还没救成呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You've saved nothing.

977
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:09,790
你的力量和我相比
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Your powers are inconsequential

978
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:11,290
根本不值一提
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}compared to mine.

979
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:13,000
是啊 但那孩子看的电影更多
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.

980
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:29,270
太棒了 等等 那些是什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yes! Wait. What are those?

981
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:46,740
嗨 咱们还没有正式见过面呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey, we haven't officially met.

982
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,040
好吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Cool.

983
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,540
我们要调转航向
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We gotta turn this ship around.

984
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:54,880
是啊 现在你倒是想逃了 真是一个好计划
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, now he wants to run. Great plan.

985
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,340
不 我想保护原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, I want to protect the stone.

986
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,760
我还想听你感谢我呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And I want you to thank me.

987
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,300
现在说吧 我听着呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

988
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:02,220
谢你什么 差点把我炸进太空吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}For what? Nearly blasting me into space?

989
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:04,550
是谁刚刚救了你这个大魔术师啊 是我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Who just saved your magical ass? Me.

990
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:05,390
我真的不知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I seriously don't know

991
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:06,560
你是怎么把你的大脑袋塞进那个头盔里的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}how you fit your head into that helmet.

992
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,390
承认吧 我叫你闪开的时候你就应该照做
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Admit it, you should've ducked out when I told you to.

993
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:11,140
我想要你老实待着 而你拒绝了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I tried to bench you. You refused.

994
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,230
我不像你生命中的其他人 我不听命于你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.

995
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:14,940
正因为你不听话
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And due to that fact,

996
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:16,360
我们现在在一个会飞的甜甜圈里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}we're now in a flying doughnut...

997
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,230
离地球几百万里远 还没有后援
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}billions of miles from Earth with no backup.

998
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:20,280
-我是后援 -不 你是偷跑上来的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- I'm backup. - No, you're a stowaway.

999
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,360
大人说话 小孩别插嘴
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The adults are talking.

1000
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:24,240
对不起 我搞不清楚你们的关系了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here.

1001
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,080
他是谁 你的保镖吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What is he, your ward?

1002
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,450
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No.

1003
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:29,500
-我是彼得 -斯特兰奇博士
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- I'm Peter, by the way. - Doctor Strange.

1004
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,250
要用艺名啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, you're using our made-up names. Um...

1005
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,380
那我是蜘蛛侠
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm Spider-Man, then.

1006
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:36,040
这架飞船正在自动矫正航线
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This ship is self-correcting its course.

1007
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,170
现在是自动驾驶模式
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thing's on autopilot.

1008
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:39,090
我们能控制它吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Can we control it?

1009
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:41,010
载我们回家
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Fly us home?

1010
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,140
-史塔克 -怎么了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Stark? - Yeah.

1011
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:46,470
你能带我们回去吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Can you get us home?

1012
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:47,890
我听到你的话了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, I heard you.

1013
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,480
我只是在想 我不太确定我们应该回去
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm thinking I'm not so sure we should.

1014
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:53,890
无论如何
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Under no circumstances

1015
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:56,440
我们都不能把时间原石送到灭霸的手中
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos.

1016
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,860
我觉得你还没有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I don't think you quite understand

1017
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:58,770
搞清楚现在的局势
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}what's at stake here.

1018
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:01,400
什么 不 是你不懂
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What? No. It's you who doesn't understand...

1019
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,320
自从他派军到纽约时起
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}that Thanos has been inside my head for six years.

1020
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,070
灭霸已经在我的脑海中盘踞六年了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Since he sent an army to New York

1021
01:04:06,070 --> 01:04:07,830
而现在他回来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and now he's back.

1022
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,910
而我不知道应该做什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And I don't know what to do.

1023
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:11,040
所以我不确定
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So I'm not so sure

1024
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,080
这场战役是在我们还是他的地盘上打更好
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his...

1025
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,920
但他们的所作所为 他们的能力 你都看见了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}but you saw what they did, what they can do.

1026
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,210
至少在他的地盘上 可以打他个措手不及
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}At least on his turf, he's not expecting it.

1027
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:22,130
所以我说 我们将战火引到他那儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So I say we take the fight to him.

1028
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:23,130
博士
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Doctor.

1029
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:26,470
你同意吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Do you concur?

1030
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:31,470
好吧 史塔克 我们去找他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All right, Stark. We go to him.

1031
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,940
但你必须要明白
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But you have to understand...

1032
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:36,520
如果我需要在救你 还有那个孩子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}if it comes to saving you

1033
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,230
和时间原石中做选择的话
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}or the kid or the Time Stone...

1034
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:42,990
我会毫不犹豫地放弃你们俩的生命
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I will not hesitate to let either of you die.

1035
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:47,160
我不能失去原石 整个宇宙的希望都在它身上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I can't, because the universe depends on it.

1036
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:50,080
很好 提前说清楚道德标准
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Nice. Good, moral compass.

1037
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:52,910
那就这样说定了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We're straight.

1038
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,410
好了 孩子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All right, kid.

1039
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:57,880
你正式是复仇者的一员了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're an Avenger now.

1040
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:36,580
我觉得你可能饿了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I thought you might be hungry.

1041
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,510
我一直恨那把椅子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I always hated that chair.

1042
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:53,260
我听说了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So I've been told.

1043
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:57,230
即便这样 我也希望你有一天能坐上它
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Even so, I'd hoped you'd sit in it one day.

1044
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,440
我恨这个房间
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I hated this room.

1045
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:01,730
这架飞船
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This ship.

1046
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,570
我恨我的人生
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I hated my life.

1047
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:10,280
你也跟我说过了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You told me that too.

1048
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:14,910
每一天
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Every day.

1049
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:19,540
我听了近二十年
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}For almost 20 years.

1050
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:24,500
你带走我时 我还只是个孩子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I was a child when you took me.

1051
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:26,670
我救了你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I saved you.

1052
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:31,090
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No.

1053
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:36,430
不是 我们曾经快乐地生活在我的母星上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No. We were happy on my home planet.

1054
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:38,180
每天在饥饿中入睡
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Going to bed hungry...

1055
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,100
以拾荒为生
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}scrounging for scraps.

1056
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:43,060
你的星球已经在崩溃的边缘了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Your planet was on the brink of collapse.

1057
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:45,480
是我拯救了那一切
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm the one who stopped that.

1058
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,490
你知道后来发生了什么吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Do you know what's happened since then?

1059
01:06:47,490 --> 01:06:49,700
新生儿们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The children born...

1060
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:53,320
在蓝天下过着富足的生活
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies.

1061
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,530
那里成了天堂
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's a paradise.

1062
01:06:57,290 --> 01:06:59,290
因为你杀掉了星球上一半的人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Because you murdered half the planet.

1063
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:02,330
那只是为了救赎而付出的小小代价而已
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A small price to pay for salvation.

1064
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:03,460
你疯了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're insane.

1065
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,590
小家伙 这是一道简单的算术题
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Little one, it's a simple calculus.

1066
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:09,050
宇宙是有限的 它的资源也是有限的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This universe is finite, its resources finite.

1067
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:13,390
如果对生命不加以约束 它最终将走向消亡
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist.

1068
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:14,600
它需要矫正
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It needs correction.

1069
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,100
你不能妄下定论
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You don't know that!

1070
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,390
我是唯一一个看清的人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm the only one who knows that.

1071
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:24,560
至少我是唯一愿意付出行动的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.

1072
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:27,230
曾经
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}For a time...

1073
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:34,120
与我并肩战斗的你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you had that same will...

1074
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:38,120
也有着共同的信仰
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}as you fought by my side.

1075
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:40,040
女儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Daughter.

1076
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,500
我不是你的女儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm not your daughter.

1077
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,670
我痛恨你教给我的一切东西
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Everything I hate about myself you taught me.

1078
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,090
正是这些
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And, in doing so,

1079
01:07:50,090 --> 01:07:52,300
让你成为银河中最勇敢无畏的女人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy.

1080
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:58,100
所以我当时才派你去寻找灵魂原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.

1081
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:04,270
抱歉我让你失望了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1082
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,070
我的确很失望
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am disappointed.

1083
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:10,440
但不是因为你没有找到
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But not because you didn't find it.

1084
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,700
而是因为你找到了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But because you did.

1085
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,080
却对我说谎了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And you lied.

1086
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:37,260
星云
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Nebula.

1087
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,850
不要这样
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Don't do this.

1088
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,310
不久以前
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Some time ago,

1089
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:50,190
你妹妹潜入这架飞船来刺杀我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.

1090
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:51,280
求求你 别这样
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Please don't do this.

1091
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,530
她差点就成功了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And very nearly succeeded.

1092
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,610
所以我把她带到这里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So I brought her here.

1093
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,450
来谈一谈
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}To talk.

1094
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:08,500
停下 住手
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stop. Stop it.

1095
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:17,260
我以我的性命起誓
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I swear to you on my life.

1096
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:19,510
我没有找到灵魂原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I never found the Soul Stone.

1097
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,390
读取记忆档案
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Accessing memory files.

1098
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:26,810
你知道他打算做什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know what he's about to do.

1099
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:29,610
现在他终于准备好了 他要去掠夺原石了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones.

1100
01:09:29,610 --> 01:09:30,820
-全部原石 -他不可能得到全部的原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- All of them. - He can never get them all.

1101
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:31,900
他会的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He will!

1102
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:34,190
他不会的 星云
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He can't, Nebula.

1103
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:36,610
因为我找到了通往灵魂原石的地图
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Because I found the map to the Soul Stone...

1104
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:39,450
然后我把它烧成了灰 我烧掉了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and I burned it to ash. I burned it.

1105
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:46,290
你的坚强
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're strong.

1106
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:49,330
是我教的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Me.

1107
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:53,460
你的慷慨
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're generous.

1108
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,760
也是我教的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Me.

1109
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,430
但我从未教过你说谎
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But I never taught you to lie.

1110
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:03,140
难怪你撒谎如此拙劣
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's why you're so bad at it.

1111
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:09,730
灵魂原石在哪里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where is the Soul Stone?

1112
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:28,250
沃米尔星
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Vormir!

1113
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:47,850
灵魂原石在沃米尔星
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The stone is on Vormir.

1114
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:53,650
带路
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Show me.

1115
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,900
我是格鲁特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am Groot.

1116
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:58,280
尿在杯子里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tinkle in the cup.

1117
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,700
我们不看 有什么好看的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We're not looking. What's there to see?

1118
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:01,950
害羞什么 谁没见过小树枝
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig before.

1119
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:03,320
我是格鲁特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am Groot.

1120
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:04,450
小树 把杯子里的东西倒进太空
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tree, pour what's in the cup

1121
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:06,290
再继续尿在里面
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}out into space and go in the cup again.

1122
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:07,370
你会说格鲁特语
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You speak Groot?

1123
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:09,540
嗯 我在阿斯加德选修过
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.

1124
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:10,710
我是格鲁特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am Groot.

1125
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:12,830
我们快到的时候你就知道了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You'll know when we're close.

1126
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,590
尼德威阿尔的熔炉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Nidavellir's forge harnesses

1127
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:16,750
能收集中子星喷发的能量
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the blazing power of a neutron star.

1128
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:21,630
我的锤子就是在那里铸造的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's the birthplace of my hammer.

1129
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,220
它的力量十分惊人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's truly awesome.

1130
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:33,350
好吧 是时候尽船长的职责了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay, time to be the captain.

1131
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,530
你弟弟死了 是吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So, dead brother, huh?

1132
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,780
那确实挺伤感的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, that could be annoying.

1133
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,700
嗯 他以前也死过
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Well, he's been dead before.

1134
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,040
但是我觉得这次可能是真的了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But, no, this time I think it really might be true.

1135
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,660
你还提到过你姐姐和爸爸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And you said your sister and your dad?

1136
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:53,580
都死了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Both dead.

1137
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,710
那至少还有个妈妈是吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But still got a mom, though?

1138
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,040
被一个黑暗精灵杀了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Killed by a dark elf.

1139
01:11:57,090 --> 01:11:58,380
最好的朋友呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A best friend?

1140
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,630
心脏被刺穿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stabbed through the heart.

1141
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:06,260
你确定你要参加这次特别的刺杀行动吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You sure you're up to this particular murder mission?

1142
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:09,970
当然
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Absolutely.

1143
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:13,730
怒火 复仇 愤怒 失落 悔恨
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Rage and vengeance, anger, loss, regret...

1144
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:15,440
都是我的动力
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}they're all tremendous motivators.

1145
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:16,560
它们能让我保持头脑清醒
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They really clear the mind.

1146
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:18,820
所以我准备好了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So I'm good to go.

1147
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:21,530
没错 但我们说的可是灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, but this Thanos we're talkin' about...

1148
01:12:21,530 --> 01:12:23,900
他是最难对付的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}he's the toughest there is.

1149
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:26,070
-那是他没有跟我打过 -他有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Well, he's never fought me. - Yeah, he has.

1150
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:28,410
他没有跟我打过两次
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He's never fought me twice.

1151
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,330
还有别忘了 我要拿到新锤子了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.

1152
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:32,540
那锤子最好厉害一点
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It better be some hammer.

1153
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:39,670
我已经1500岁了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

1154
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:41,840
我杀过两倍于这个数字的敌人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I've killed twice as many enemies as that.

1155
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,880
他们每一个都想置我于死地
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And every one of them would've rather killed me,

1156
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,590
却没一个成功
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}but none succeeded.

1157
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:48,680
是命运要我活着
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm only alive because fate wants me alive.

1158
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:51,640
灭霸只是这些混蛋中的一个
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos is just the latest in a long line of bastards...

1159
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,680
他也将尝到我复仇的怒火
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and he'll be the latest to feel my vengeance.

1160
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,600
这也是命运的安排
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Fate wills it so.

1161
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,940


1162
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,810
那万一你错了呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And what if you're wrong?

1163
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:03,860
如果我错了 那
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If I'm wrong, then...

1164
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:06,740
我还有什么可失去的呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}what more could I lose?

1165
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:21,960
我能失去的还有很多
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I could lose a lot.

1166
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,050
我在世上还有很多牵挂
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Me, personally, I could lose a lot.

1167
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:28,890
好吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay.

1168
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:34,140
如果命运真的想让你杀死那个王八蛋
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If fate does want you to kill that crapsack...

1169
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:36,060
你就不能只有一只眼睛
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.

1170
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:38,520
-这是什么 -这看起来像什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- What's this? - What's it look like?

1171
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:41,150
一个混球在康特阿克夏星打赌输给了我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Some jerk lost a bet with me on Contraxia.

1172
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:42,530
他把眼睛给你了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He gave you his eye?

1173
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:43,780
才不是 他给了我100个筹码
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, he gave me 100 credits.

1174
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:46,740
我当晚溜进他的房间偷走了他的眼睛
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I snuck into his room later that night and stole his eye.

1175
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:49,950
谢谢 可爱的兔兔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thank you, sweet rabbit.

1176
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:50,950


1177
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:55,000
嗯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Huh?

1178
01:13:56,830 --> 01:13:58,120
噢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh.

1179
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,920
要是我的话就先洗一下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I would've washed that.

1180
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,590
唯一能把它带出康特阿克夏星的方法就是把它塞到我的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...

1181
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,840
嘿 我们到了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey, we're here!

1182
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,100
我觉得这东西不管用
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I don't think this thing works.

1183
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:12,430
我的眼前一片漆黑
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Everything seems dark.

1184
01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:16,560
不是眼睛的问题
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It ain't the eye.

1185
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:31,160
有哪里不对劲
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Something's wrong.

1186
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:33,620
这颗星球熄灭了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The star's gone out.

1187
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:35,950
行星环也停住了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And the rings are frozen.

1188
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:58,730
希望这些矮人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I hope these dwarves are better

1189
01:14:58,730 --> 01:15:00,560
铸造武器的手艺比他们打扫的本领强
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}at forging than they are cleaning.

1190
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:07,230
或许他们搬家是因为意识到了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Maybe they realized that they live

1191
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:08,900
他们住在宇宙的一个垃圾堆里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}in a junk pile in the middle of space.

1192
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:11,910
这座熔炉几个世纪以来都没有熄灭过
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries.

1193
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,950
你说过灭霸有个无限手套 是吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?

1194
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:18,250
是的 怎么了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yes, why?

1195
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:20,460
它是长这样吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It look anything like that?

1196
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:25,750
我是格鲁特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am Groot.

1197
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:27,130
回分离舱上去
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Go back to the pod.

1198
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:32,180
伊特里 等等
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Eitri, wait!

1199
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:34,180
停下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stop!

1200
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,100
住手
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stop.

1201
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:37,890
索尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thor?

1202
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:42,980
这里发生了什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What happened here?

1203
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:46,150
你本应该保护我们的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You were supposed to protect us.

1204
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:48,980
阿斯加德本应该保护我们的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Asgard was supposed to protect us.

1205
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:51,150
阿斯加德被毁灭了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Asgard is destroyed.

1206
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:57,240
伊特里 那个手套 你们做了什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Eitri, the glove. What did you do?

1207
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:13,050
有三百个矮人住在这个行星环上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}300 dwarves lived on this ring.

1208
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:17,470
我以为只要我按他的要求做了 他们就会安全
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe.

1209
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:21,270
我铸造了他想要的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I made what he wanted.

1210
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:27,480
一个能够驾驭无限原石力量的装置
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones.

1211
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:34,610
然而 他还是杀了所有人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Then he killed everyone anyway.

1212
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:38,490
除了我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All except me.

1213
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:41,290
“你的生命属于你自己” 他说
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}"Your life is yours," He said.

1214
01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:47,670
“但你的双手属于我”
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}"But your hands are mine alone."

1215
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,670
伊特里 这已经不仅仅是你手的问题了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Eitri, this isn't about your hands.

1216
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,300
所有你所设计的武器
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Every weapon you've ever designed,

1217
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,970
每一个战斧 锤子 宝剑
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}every axe, hammer, sword...

1218
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:57,010
全都刻在你的脑子里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}it's all inside your head.

1219
01:16:57,010 --> 01:16:59,100
现在 我知道这一切看起来毫无希望
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Now, I know it feels like all hope is lost.

1220
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:01,100
相信我 我知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Trust me, I know.

1221
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:05,850
但是 你我一起 我们就能够杀掉灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.

1222
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:48,850
曼蒂斯 仔细听我说
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Mantis, listen very carefully.

1223
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:51,020
我要你去泰坦星见我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I need you to meet me on Titan.

1224
01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:58,910
嘿 怎么了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey, what's going on?

1225
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:00,200
我想我们到了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I think we're here.

1226
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:02,740
我觉得这艘船大概没有自动降落功能
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I don't think this rig has a self-park function.

1227
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:06,080
把你的手放进操纵环架里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Get your hand inside the steering gimbal.

1228
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,080
把这些关掉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Close those around it.

1229
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:10,000
-你明白了吗 -明白了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- You understand? - Yep, got it.

1230
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,290
这是一个大个子的操纵台 所以我们需要
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta

1231
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:13,050
-一起行动 -好的 准备好了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- move at the same time. - Okay, okay. Ready.

1232
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:18,880
我们可能需要转向
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We might wanna turn.

1233
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,090
转向 转向 转向
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Turn! Turn! Turn!

1234
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,630
你还好吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You all right?

1235
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:54,250
好险
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That was close.

1236
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,340
我欠你一次
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I owe you one.

1237
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:59,470
我提前说一句
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Let me just say, if aliens

1238
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:01,430
如果异形在我胸腔里产了卵
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something...

1239
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:02,470
然后我吃了你们其中一个 那就抱歉了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.

1240
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:05,180
在接下来的旅途中
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I do not want another single pop culture reference

1241
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:06,930
我都不想再听到你说任何流行文化的梗了 你明白了吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?

1242
01:19:06,930 --> 01:19:08,310
我想说的是 有什么东西过来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm trying to say that something is coming.

1243
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:16,900
灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos!

1244
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,840
天哪 求你别在我身体里产卵
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't put your eggs in me!

1245
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:43,720
去死吧 小丑
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stay down, clown.

1246
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:50,980
受死吧 死亡之毯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Die, blanket of death!

1247
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:59,860
所有人待在原地 冷静一下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Everybody stay where you are. Chill the eff out.

1248
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:03,030
我只问你一次
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm gonna ask you this one time.

1249
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:05,160
卡魔拉在哪里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where is Gamora?

1250
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,990
我问你一个更好的问题 卡魔拉是谁
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah. I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?

1251
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:10,960
我来问一个更好的问题 为什么要抓卡魔拉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'll do you one better. Why is Gamora?

1252
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,960
告诉我那女孩在哪里 不然我发誓
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tell me where the girl is or I swear to you

1253
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,210
我会把这个小怪物炸成薯条
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm gonna French fry this little freak.

1254
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:17,840
谁怕谁 你给我的人一枪 我就给他一炮 来啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Let's do it. You shoot my guy and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1255
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,420
动手 奎尔 我能受得住
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Do it, Quill! I can take it.

1256
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:22,550
-不 他受不住的 -她说得对 你受不住
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- No, he can't take it! - She's right. You can't.

1257
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:24,930
哦 是吗 你不打算告诉我她在哪里是吗 没关系
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine.

1258
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:26,050
我会干掉你们三个
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'll kill all three of you

1259
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:28,060
然后亲自去拷问灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself.

1260
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:29,100
就从你开始
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Starting with you.

1261
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:30,060
等等 等等 灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wait, what, Thanos?

1262
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,890
好了 我就问你一遍
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All right, let me ask you this one time.

1263
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:34,560
你效忠于何人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What master do you serve?

1264
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,060
我效忠于何人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What master do I serve?

1265
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:37,400
我该怎么说 效忠于"耶稣"吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What am I supposed to say, "Jesus"?

1266
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,280
你是地球人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're from Earth.

1267
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,190
我才不是 我密苏里人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm not from Earth, I'm from Missouri.

1268
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:42,150
密苏里就在地球上 蠢货
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.

1269
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:43,320
那你们为什么要找我们麻烦
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What are you hassling us for?

1270
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,110
所以你们不是和灭霸一伙的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So you're not with Thanos?

1271
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:48,030
和灭霸一伙？
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}With Thanos?

1272
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:50,830
才不是 我是来杀灭霸的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

1273
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:53,370
他绑走了我女朋友 等等 你们到底是谁
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He took my girl. Wait, who are you?

1274
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:55,210
-我们是复仇者联盟 哥们儿 -哦
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- We're the Avengers, man. - Oh.

1275
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:57,590
你们就是索尔跟我们说的那些人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're the ones Thor told us about.

1276
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:59,040
你认识索尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know Thor?

1277
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,000
对
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah.

1278
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,880
高个子 长得不帅 心理还有问题
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tall guy, not that good-looking, needed saving.

1279
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,430
他现在在哪里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where is he now?

1280
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,480
这就是计划吗 我们带着一块砖去拍他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This is the plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?

1281
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,860
这只是个模具
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's a mold.

1282
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,450
王之武器
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A king's weapon.

1283
01:21:25,450 --> 01:21:28,410
本是阿斯加德之最
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Meant to be the greatest in Asgard.

1284
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:31,450
理论上 它甚至可以召唤彩虹桥
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.

1285
01:21:31,450 --> 01:21:33,000
它有名字吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Did it have a name?

1286
01:21:34,210 --> 01:21:35,920
风暴之锤
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stormbreaker.

1287
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,000
有点中二
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's a bit much.

1288
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,130
所以我们要怎么把它造出来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So how do we make it?

1289
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:44,130
你要重新燃起熔炉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You'll have to restart the forge.

1290
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:47,300
唤醒一颗濒死星球的心脏
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Awaken the heart of a dying star.

1291
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:52,470
兔子 去启动分离舱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1292
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:58,310
这星球到底经历了什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The hell happened to this planet?

1293
01:21:58,310 --> 01:22:00,230
偏离了轴线八度
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's eight degrees off its axis.

1294
01:22:00,230 --> 01:22:02,400
引力到处都是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gravitational pull is all over the place.

1295
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:07,490
是啊 我们有一个优势 他会来找我们的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us.

1296
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:10,320
我们就利用这点 好了 我有个计划
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We'll use it. All right, I have a plan.

1297
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,660
或者至少是初步计划
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Or at least the beginnings of one.

1298
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,160
很简单 我们把他引过来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's pretty simple. We draw him in,

1299
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,500
合力擒住他 拿走我们需要的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}pin him down, get what we need.

1300
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,290
我们明显不能和这家伙周旋纠缠
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy.

1301
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:18,000
我们只需要拿到手套
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We just want the gauntlet.

1302
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,330
你是在打哈欠吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Are you yawning?

1303
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:22,630
在我解释计划的这个时候 哈
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh?

1304
01:22:22,630 --> 01:22:24,460
你有听到我说了什么吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Did you hear what I said?

1305
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:27,010
在你说“我们需要一个计划”之后 我就没再听了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I stopped listening after you said, "We need a plan."

1306
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:28,050
好吧 光头先生沉浸在自己的世界里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.

1307
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:31,180
“别搞砸事情”不是他们的作风
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}See, "Not winging it" Isn't really what they do.

1308
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:32,930
呃 那他们的实际作风是什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, what exactly is it that they do?

1309
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:34,520
拉风头 抢仇恨
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Kick names, take ass.

1310
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,930
是的 没错
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, that's right.

1311
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,320
算了 先都聚过来吧 拜托了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All right, just get over here, please.

1312
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,360
爵士先生 你能让你的人围过来吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?

1313
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,530
什么“爵士先生” 叫我星爵就行
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

1314
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,660
我们要联合起来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We gotta coalesce.

1315
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:54,490
因为如果我们全都迎面而上 是勇气可嘉的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude...

1316
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:57,040
大哥 别跟我们说什么勇气
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Dude, don't call us plucky.

1317
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,540
我们不懂那是什么意思
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We don't know what it means.

1318
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:01,330
好吧 我们都很乐观 没错 我喜欢你的计划
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All right, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan.

1319
01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:04,040
不过它很烂 所以让我来定计划
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Except it sucks, so let me do the plan...

1320
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,090
这样我们的计划没准会很棒
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and that way it might be really good.

1321
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:08,220
告诉他你是怎么通过尬舞拯救宇宙的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.

1322
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:10,430
-什么尬舞 -没什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- What dance-off? - It's nothing.

1323
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:11,590
就像《浑身是劲》电影里那样吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Like in Footloose, the movie?

1324
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:13,550
没错 就跟《浑身是劲》一样
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Exactly like Footloose.

1325
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:15,260
它还是史上最棒的电影吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Is it still the greatest movie in history?

1326
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:16,520
它从来就不是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It never was.

1327
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:17,600
别让他来劲 好吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Don't encourage this, all right?

1328
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,100
-好吧 -这位飞侠哥顿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Okay. - We're getting no help

1329
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,640
-显然帮不上我们什么 -飞侠哥顿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- from Flash Gordon here. - Flash Gordon?

1330
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,400
顺便一说 那可是称赞
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}By the way, that's a compliment.

1331
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,150
别忘了 我是半个人类
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Don't forget, I'm half human.

1332
01:23:24,150 --> 01:23:25,570
所以那一半的我是蠢的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So that 50% of me that's stupid...

1333
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:28,070
而你们就是百分百的蠢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}that's 100% you.

1334
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:29,360
你的数学真令我震惊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Your math is blowing my mind.

1335
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,570
打扰一下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Excuse me.

1336
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:35,120
但你们的朋友经常那样吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But does your friend often do that?

1337
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:38,700
斯特兰奇 你还好吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Strange, we all right?

1338
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:50,260
你回来了 你没事
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're back. You're all right.

1339
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:52,470
-嗨 -嘿 刚刚是怎么回事
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Hi. - Hey, what was that?

1340
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:57,100
我顺着时间前进 去浏览未来的可能
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I went forward in time to view alternate futures.

1341
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,600
去看即将来临的大战
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}To see all the possible outcomes

1342
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,480
所有可能发生的结局
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}of the coming conflict.

1343
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:02,690
你看到了多少种结局
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How many did you see?

1344
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:05,110
一千四百万六百零五种
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}14,000,605.

1345
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:08,150
我们赢了多少次
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How many did we win?

1346
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:14,120
一次
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}One.

1347
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:39,010
为了你妹妹小命
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The stone had better be up there.

1348
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,770
原石最好在那里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}For your sister's sake.

1349
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:08,500
欢迎 灭霸 阿拉尔斯之子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1350
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:14,090
卡魔拉 灭霸之女
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1351
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:15,340
你认识我们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know us?

1352
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:20,390
认识每一个来到这里的人就是我的诅咒
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It is my curse to know all who journey here.

1353
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:22,140
灵魂原石在哪里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where is the Soul Stone?

1354
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:25,140
你该知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You should know...

1355
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:28,270
它会让你付出可怕的代价
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}it extracts a terrible price.

1356
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,190
我准备好了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am prepared.

1357
01:25:33,570 --> 01:25:36,110
一开始 我们都这样以为
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We all think that at first.

1358
01:25:40,530 --> 01:25:42,790
但我们都错了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We are all wrong.

1359
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:56,880
你为什么对这个地方如此熟悉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How is it you know this place so well?

1360
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:01,720
一百年前 我也试图寻找无限原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones.

1361
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:04,600
甚至已经有一颗在我的手上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I even held one in my hand.

1362
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:08,770
但它驱逐了我 将我流放至此
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But it cast me out, banished me here.

1363
01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:12,820
指引他人搜寻我无法拥有的珍宝
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.

1364
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:24,540
你所寻找的就在你面前
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What you seek lies in front of you.

1365
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,580
你所畏惧的也是如此
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}As does what you fear.

1366
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:30,380
这是什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What's this?

1367
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:31,920
代价
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The price.

1368
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:37,630
在所有无限原石中 灵魂原石有着特殊的地位
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Soul holds a special place among the Infinity Stones.

1369
01:26:37,630 --> 01:26:41,720
可以说 它有一定的智慧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You might say it has a certain wisdom.

1370
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:45,220
告诉我 它需要什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tell me what it needs.

1371
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:48,770
为了确保拥有它的人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}To ensure that whoever possesses it...

1372
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:51,440
理解它的能量
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}understands its power...

1373
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:56,320
这颗原石需要献祭
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the stone demands a sacrifice.

1374
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,280
献祭什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Of what?

1375
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,320
为了获得灵魂原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}In order to take the stone,

1376
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,660
你必须失去你所爱的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you must lose that which you love.

1377
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:06,830
一个灵魂
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A soul...

1378
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:08,790
换取另一个灵魂
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}for a soul.

1379
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,810
我这一生 都梦想着有一天
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All my life, I dreamed of a day...

1380
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:29,310
有一个时刻
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}a moment...

1381
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,650
你会遭到报应
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}when you got what you deserved.

1382
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:37,230
但我总会失望
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And I was always so disappointed.

1383
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:42,280
但是现在
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But now...

1384
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:49,330
你杀戮 折磨他人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You kill and torture...

1385
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:53,290
还称之为仁慈
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and you call it mercy.

1386
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:59,420
宇宙给了你判决
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The universe has judged you.

1387
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:05,470
你想让它给你奖赏 而它对你说不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You asked it for a prize, and it told you no.

1388
01:28:06,890 --> 01:28:08,520
你失败了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You failed.

1389
01:28:09,810 --> 01:28:11,690
你想知道为什么吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And do you wanna know why?

1390
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:14,520
因为你什么都不爱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Because you love nothing.

1391
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:16,820
谁都不爱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No one.

1392
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:23,660
不对
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No.

1393
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:29,370
真的吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Really?

1394
01:28:30,370 --> 01:28:31,460
哭了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tears?

1395
01:28:32,290 --> 01:28:34,250
这眼泪不是为他自己而流
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They're not for him.

1396
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:49,640
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No.

1397
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,560
这不是爱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This isn't love.

1398
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:56,020
我曾忽视过自己的命运
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I ignored my destiny once.

1399
01:28:58,570 --> 01:29:00,730
我不能重蹈覆辙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I cannot do that again.

1400
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:04,610
即使是为了你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Even for you.

1401
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:31,100
我很抱歉 小家伙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sorry, little one.

1402
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:36,350
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No!

1403
01:31:13,830 --> 01:31:16,830
降低高度到2600 朝0-3-0坐标前进
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1404
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:18,160
我希望你没搞错
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I hope you're right about this.

1405
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:21,080
不然我们可就提前着陆了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to.

1406
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:38,230
当你说我们要向世界
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}When you said we were going to open Wakanda

1407
01:31:38,230 --> 01:31:39,640
开放瓦坎达的时候
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to the rest of the world...

1408
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:41,940
我可没想到是这样子的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}this is not what I imagined.

1409
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:44,020
你以为是什么样子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And what did you imagine?

1410
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:45,480
参加奥林匹克运动会
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The Olympics.

1411
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,070
或许再开个星巴克
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Maybe even a Starbucks.

1412
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:02,880
我们该行礼吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Should we bow?

1413
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,540
当然了 他可是国王
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, he's a king.

1414
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:06,550
似乎我总是在向你道谢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Seems like I'm always thanking you for something.

1415
01:32:07,710 --> 01:32:09,880
你在干什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What are you doing?

1416
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:12,010
我们这里不用行礼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, we don't do that here.

1417
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:14,550
所以 我们会面临多大规模的战斗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So how big of an assault should we expect?

1418
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:17,680
呃 陛下 我想你们要做好准备应对一场激烈的战斗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, sir, I think you should expect quite a big assault.

1419
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:18,720
我们有多少兵力
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How we looking?

1420
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:20,770
我们这边出战的有我的国王护卫队
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You will have my Kingsguard,

1421
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:24,730
边境部落 女子皇家亲卫队 还有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...

1422
01:32:24,730 --> 01:32:27,650
还有一位处于半稳定状态的百岁老人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And a semi-stable 100-year-old man.

1423
01:32:30,570 --> 01:32:31,820
你怎么样 巴基
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How you been, Buck?

1424
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:34,910
还行吧 毕竟世界末日都要来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, not bad, for the end of the world.

1425
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,090
哇
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Whoa.

1426
01:32:48,090 --> 01:32:50,710
原石是多形态结构的水晶
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The structure is polymorphic.

1427
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:53,930
没错 我们必须对每个神经元进行非序列性连接
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.

1428
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:55,890
你们为什么不对神经元突触
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Why didn't you just reprogram

1429
01:32:55,890 --> 01:32:57,970
进行重新编码 使其能协调地工作
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the synapses to work collectively?

1430
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:02,770
因为我们没想到这一点
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Because we didn't think of it.

1431
01:33:02,770 --> 01:33:04,150
我相信你们已经尽力了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sure you did your best.

1432
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:06,270
你能做到吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Can you do it?

1433
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:09,820
能 但这里有超过两万亿的神经元
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here.

1434
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:13,280
一点偏差就会导致一连串的回路故障
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures.

1435
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,530
我需要时间 哥哥
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It will take time, brother.

1436
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:17,200
多长时间
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How long?

1437
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:18,620
越长越好
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}As long as you can give me.

1438
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,290
有外来物正在侵入大气层
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Something's entered the atmosphere.

1439
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:44,600
队长 我们这里有情况
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.

1440
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:55,610
天呐 我爱死这个地方了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}God, I love this place.

1441
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:57,780
先别急着欢呼 伙计们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys.

1442
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:59,700
穹顶外有更多的攻击要来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We got more incoming outside the dome.

1443
01:34:18,890 --> 01:34:19,970
太迟了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's too late.

1444
01:34:21,010 --> 01:34:22,850
我们必须现在就毁掉原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We need to destroy the stone now.

1445
01:34:22,850 --> 01:34:24,680
幻视 乖乖躺回桌上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Vision, get your ass back on the table.

1446
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:26,100
我们会拖住他们的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We will hold them off.

1447
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:29,770
旺达 一旦原石离开了他的头
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wanda, as soon as that stone's out of his head...

1448
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:30,770
你就立刻毁了它
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you blow it to hell.

1449
01:34:31,110 --> 01:34:32,320
我会的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I will.

1450
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:35,150
疏散全城 全面戒备
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Evacuate the city. Engage all defenses.

1451
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:37,320
给这个男人一块盾牌
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And get this man a shield.

1452
01:34:47,870 --> 01:34:49,000
我觉得
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I don't think

1453
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,380
你不懂这里的科学系统如何运作
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you get the scientifics here.

1454
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:52,920
这些行星环庞大无比 想让它们动起来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving...

1455
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,300
你需要更大的东西
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you're gonna need something a lot bigger

1456
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:55,670
才能拉动它们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to yank 'em loose.

1457
01:34:55,670 --> 01:34:57,840
-交给我 -交给你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Leave that to me. - Leave it to you?

1458
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:01,010
哥们 你是在太空里 你手里只有一条绳子和一个
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a...

1459
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:10,350
发动引擎
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Fire the engines!

1460
01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:30,670
加大火力 兔子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}More power, rabbit!

1461
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:03,870
干得好 孩子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Well done, boy.

1462
01:36:05,490 --> 01:36:07,450
这才是尼德威阿尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's Nidavellir.

1463
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:29,020
该死
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Damn it.

1464
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:30,810
“该死” “该死”是什么意思
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}"Damn it"? What's "Damn it"?

1465
01:36:30,810 --> 01:36:32,190
机械装置出故障了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The mechanism is crippled.

1466
01:36:32,190 --> 01:36:33,810
-什么 -光圈闭合的话
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- What? - With the iris closed,

1467
01:36:33,810 --> 01:36:34,980
我就没办法加热金属
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I can't heat the metal.

1468
01:36:34,980 --> 01:36:36,770
加热需要多长时间
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How long will it take to heat it?

1469
01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:39,070
几分钟 或者更久 为什么这么问
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

1470
01:36:41,070 --> 01:36:42,240
我去撑开它
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm gonna hold it open.

1471
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,490
你这是在自杀
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's suicide.

1472
01:36:43,490 --> 01:36:45,990
不带那把斧子去迎战灭霸也是自杀
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So is facing Thanos without that axe.

1473
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:56,840
你感觉怎么样 布鲁斯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How we looking, Bruce?

1474
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,750
挺好 我觉得我开始适应了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

1475
01:37:02,010 --> 01:37:04,140
哇 太炫了 大家伙儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wow! This is amazing, man.

1476
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:06,140
感觉就像不用变身就成了浩克
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's like being the Hulk without actually...

1477
01:37:09,930 --> 01:37:12,100
我没事 我没事
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm okay. I'm okay.

1478
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:14,560
我发现有两个热信号
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I've got two heat signatures

1479
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:15,770
正在突破林木线
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}breaking through the tree line.

1480
01:37:44,130 --> 01:37:46,840
感谢你们能与我们并肩作战
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thank you for standing with us.

1481
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:10,580
你的另一个丑朋友呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where's your other friend?

1482
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:13,080
你们会为他偿命的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You will pay for his life with yours.

1483
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:17,080
灭霸将会拿到那颗原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos will have that stone.

1484
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:18,580
想都别想
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's not gonna happen.

1485
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:21,130
你们现在是在瓦坎达
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You are in Wakanda now.

1486
01:38:21,130 --> 01:38:24,510
灭霸只会得到灰烬和鲜血
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.

1487
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:29,890
我们的血多得是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We have blood to spare.

1488
01:38:41,150 --> 01:38:42,610
他们投降了吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They surrender?

1489
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,490
没有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not exactly.

1490
01:39:11,470 --> 01:39:12,970
什么鬼东西
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What the hell?

1491
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:17,520
看来我们惹毛她了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Looks like we pissed her off.

1492
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:29,910
他们是在自杀
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They're killing themselves.

1493
01:40:06,110 --> 01:40:07,650
你看到那些怪物的牙了吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You see the teeth on those things?

1494
01:40:07,650 --> 01:40:08,690
好了 退后 山姆
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All right, back up, Sam.

1495
01:40:08,690 --> 01:40:09,900
你会烤焦你的翅膀的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're gonna get your wings singed.

1496
01:40:22,330 --> 01:40:23,710
队长 如果这些怪物绕过防护线
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Cap, if these things circle the perimeter

1497
01:40:23,710 --> 01:40:24,880
从我们后面攻进来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and get in behind us...

1498
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,210
那可就直接扑上幻视了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}there's nothing between them and Vision.

1499
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:29,220
那么我们最好把他们牵制在我们跟前
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Then we better keep 'em in front of us.

1500
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:30,470
我们该怎么做
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How do we do that?

1501
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:34,470
我们打开屏障
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We open the barrier.

1502
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:41,230
听我的指令 打开西北部第十七号屏障
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen.

1503
01:40:41,230 --> 01:40:43,230
请确认指令 陛下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Requesting confirmation, My King.

1504
01:40:43,230 --> 01:40:45,060
您刚刚是说打开屏障吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You said open the barrier?

1505
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:46,440
听我的指令
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}On my signal.

1506
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:48,360
这会是瓦坎达的末日
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This will be the end of Wakanda.

1507
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:53,160
那这也将是史上最辉煌的落幕
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Then it will be the noblest ending in history.

1508
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:07,590
瓦坎达万岁
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wakanda forever!

1509
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:21,060
就现在
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Now!

1510
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:52,800
还要多久 苏睿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How much longer, Shuri?

1511
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,550
我才刚刚开始 哥哥
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I've barely begun, brother.

1512
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:56,430
你最好加快速度
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You might want to pick up the pace.

1513
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:05,480
天父啊 请赐予我力量
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Allfathers, give me strength.

1514
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:07,480
你明白吗 孩子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You understand, boy?

1515
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:10,480
你将会承受一颗星球的全部力量
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're about to take the full force of a star.

1516
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,490
你会死的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It'll kill you.

1517
01:42:13,490 --> 01:42:15,650
真死了再说
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Only if I die.

1518
01:42:16,110 --> 01:42:17,490
没错
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yes.

1519
01:42:17,490 --> 01:42:20,330
这就是“死”的意思
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's what killing you means.

1520
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:50,230
坚持 坚持住 索尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

1521
01:43:40,610 --> 01:43:42,580
索尔 说句话 拜托
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thor! Say something. Come on.

1522
01:43:43,530 --> 01:43:44,540
索尔 你还好吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thor, you okay?

1523
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:51,630
我觉得他快死了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I think he's dying.

1524
01:43:51,630 --> 01:43:53,590
他需要这把斧头
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He needs the axe!

1525
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,420
斧柄在哪里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where's the handle?

1526
01:43:59,470 --> 01:44:01,760
树人 快帮我找找斧柄
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tree, help me find the handle!

1527
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:12,830
它们的数量太多了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}There's too many of 'em!

1528
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:42,740
你们要大祸临头了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You guys are so screwed now!

1529
01:45:45,990 --> 01:45:48,030
给我把灭霸叫来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Bring me Thanos!

1530
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:22,360
啊 没错
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, yeah.

1531
01:46:25,490 --> 01:46:27,490
灭霸人如其名
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're much more of a Thanos.

1532
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:31,910
看来乌木喉已经死了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I take it the Maw is dead.

1533
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:36,710
今天伤亡惨重
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This day extracts a heavy toll.

1534
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:40,960
不过 他还是完成了他的任务
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Still, he accomplished his mission.

1535
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:42,590
你会后悔的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You may regret that.

1536
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:44,800
他让你和至尊法师
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He brought you face-to-face

1537
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,340
正面对决
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}with the Master of the Mystic Arts.

1538
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:51,850
你认为他把你带到了哪儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And where do you think he brought you?

1539
01:46:52,930 --> 01:46:55,680
让我猜猜 你的家乡吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Let me guess. Your home?

1540
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:01,400
曾经是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It was.

1541
01:47:04,030 --> 01:47:05,570
过去它是那么的美
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And it was beautiful.

1542
01:47:08,070 --> 01:47:10,740
泰坦像许多其他的星球那样
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Titan was like most planets.

1543
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:13,790
人口太多 资源却不够
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Too many mouths, not enough to go around.

1544
01:47:13,790 --> 01:47:17,000
当我们面临灭绝的时候 我提出了一个解决办法
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.

1545
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,920
大屠杀
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Genocide.

1546
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:24,000
随机 公正 无论贫富贵贱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike.

1547
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:28,180
他们说我是疯子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They called me a madman.

1548
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:30,590
但我所预言的最终却成真了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And what I predicted came to pass.

1549
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:35,350
那恭喜你了 你可真是个预言家
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Congratulations, you're a prophet.

1550
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:37,100
我是个幸存者
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm a survivor.

1551
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:39,600
一个想杀死亿万人的幸存者
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Who wants to murder trillions.

1552
01:47:39,650 --> 01:47:43,820
集齐六块原石 我只需要轻松地打个响指
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers.

1553
01:47:43,820 --> 01:47:48,610
他们就不复存在了 这是我的仁慈
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They would all cease to exist. I call that mercy.

1554
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:52,070
然后呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And then what?

1555
01:47:53,530 --> 01:47:55,790
我才能最终得到安歇
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'd finally rest...

1556
01:47:55,790 --> 01:48:00,000
看着太阳在一个对我充满感激的宇宙里升起
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.

1557
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,500
只有意志最坚强的人才能做出如此艰难的选择
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The hardest choices require the strongest wills.

1558
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:09,090
你马上就会知道我们的意志也跟你的一样强
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I think you'll find our will equal to yours.

1559
01:48:10,630 --> 01:48:11,640
我们的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Our?

1560
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:19,140
小菜一碟 奎尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Piece of cake, Quill.

1561
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:21,560
是啊 如果你只是想惹毛他的话
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off.

1562
01:48:59,730 --> 01:49:01,060
嘣
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Boom!

1563
01:49:01,060 --> 01:49:03,850
不要让他合上拳头
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Don't let him close his fist.

1564
01:49:08,030 --> 01:49:09,030
看我的魔法
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Magic.

1565
01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:10,690
更多魔法
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}More magic.

1566
01:49:11,570 --> 01:49:12,570
魔法加一个飞踢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Magic with a kick.

1567
01:49:13,070 --> 01:49:14,070
魔法加一个
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Magic with a...

1568
01:49:15,530 --> 01:49:16,780
臭虫子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Insect!

1569
01:49:54,110 --> 01:49:55,570
原来是你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Well, well.

1570
01:49:55,570 --> 01:49:56,740
你早该杀了我的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You should've killed me.

1571
01:49:56,740 --> 01:49:58,580
那可就浪费了你身上的零件了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It would've been a waste of parts!

1572
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,170
卡魔拉在哪
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where's Gamora?

1573
01:50:46,370 --> 01:50:47,750
控制住他了吗 不要放松
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Is he under? Don't let up.

1574
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:50,380
快一点 他太强壮了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Be quick. He is very strong.

1575
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:52,760
帕克 快来这儿帮忙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Parker, help! Get over here.

1576
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:55,010
她坚持不了多久 快动手
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

1577
01:51:00,390 --> 01:51:01,720
我们得掰开他的手指才能拿下来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We gotta open his fingers to get it off.

1578
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:02,890
我还以为你很难对付呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I thought you'd be hard to catch.

1579
01:51:02,890 --> 01:51:04,060
以防大家不知道 这是我的计划
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}For the record, this was my plan.

1580
01:51:05,310 --> 01:51:07,100
现在没那么嚣张了吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're not so strong now, huh?

1581
01:51:07,690 --> 01:51:09,360
卡魔拉在哪
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where is Gamora?

1582
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:11,650
是我的卡魔拉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}My Gamora.

1583
01:51:11,650 --> 01:51:13,940
你放屁
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, bullshit!

1584
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:15,150
她在哪
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where is she?

1585
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:17,660
他现在极度痛苦
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He is in anguish.

1586
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:20,320
很好
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Good.

1587
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:23,200
他 他在哀悼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He... He mourns.

1588
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:26,910
这个怪物有什么好哀悼的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What does this monster have to mourn?

1589
01:51:27,670 --> 01:51:28,750
卡魔拉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gamora.

1590
01:51:32,670 --> 01:51:34,000
什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What?

1591
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,090
他带她去了沃米尔星
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He took her to Vormir.

1592
01:51:36,090 --> 01:51:38,050
然后他带着灵魂原石回来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He came back with the Soul Stone.

1593
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:40,300
她却没回来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But she didn't.

1594
01:51:42,220 --> 01:51:46,270
奎尔 你现在得冷静下来 你明白吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now. You understand?

1595
01:51:46,270 --> 01:51:49,850
别别别 别动手 我们马上就要摘下来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Don't, don't. Don't engage. We almost got this off!

1596
01:51:51,020 --> 01:51:52,020
告诉我她在撒谎
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tell me she's lying.

1597
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:57,240
混蛋 告诉我你没杀她
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Asshole, tell me you didn't do it!

1598
01:51:58,820 --> 01:52:02,160
我必须那么做
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I had to.

1599
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:04,370
不 你没有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, you didn't.

1600
01:52:04,370 --> 01:52:06,200
不 你没有

-不 你没有杀她 -奎尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- No, you didn't! - Quill!

不 天呐
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, God.

1606

1609
01:53:31,410 --> 01:53:34,130
-你的枪多少钱 -不卖
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- How much for the gun? - Not for sale.

1610
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:36,040
好吧 那手臂多少钱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay. How much for the arm?

1611
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:40,010
行吧 我会自己搞到手的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, I'll get that arm.

1612
01:53:48,850 --> 01:53:50,140
新发型吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}New haircut?

1613
01:53:50,140 --> 01:53:51,390
你留的那胡子是学我的吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Noticed you've copied my beard.

1614
01:53:53,890 --> 01:53:55,900
顺便说下 这是我朋友 小树
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}By the way, this is a friend of mine, Tree.

1615
01:53:56,810 --> 01:53:58,770
我是格鲁特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am Groot.

1616
01:53:59,570 --> 01:54:01,490
我是史蒂夫·罗杰斯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am Steve Rogers.

1617
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:23,340
撤退 撤退 快
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Fall back! Fall back, now!

1618
01:54:32,850 --> 01:54:35,100
山姆 瞄准左翼开火
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.

1619
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:36,190
正在这么做
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm doing it.

1620
01:55:00,130 --> 01:55:01,840
她怎么不早点下来帮忙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Why was she up there all this time?

1621
01:55:02,590 --> 01:55:05,510
引她出来了 去抢原石吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}She's on the field. Take it.

1622
01:55:37,210 --> 01:55:39,380
伙伴们 幻视那边有危险了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Guys, we got a Vision situation here.

1623
01:55:42,090 --> 01:55:44,210
快去幻视那边
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Somebody get to Vision!

1624
01:55:44,210 --> 01:55:46,050
-我去帮他 -我马上到
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- I got him! - On my way.

1625
01:55:51,350 --> 01:55:54,350
他会孤独地死去 你也是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He'll die alone. As will you.

1626
01:55:54,350 --> 01:55:55,600
她可没有落单
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}She's not alone.

1627
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:23,670
住手 你们休想
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, no, you don't.

1628
01:56:23,670 --> 01:56:25,380
这次可不会像在纽约时一样 伙计
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This isn't gonna be like New York, pal.

1629
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:27,970
这套装甲曾经可是把浩克都揍扁过
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This suit's already kicked the crap outta the Hulk.

1630
01:56:27,970 --> 01:56:29,010
什么 不 不要
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What? No! No!

1631
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:35,310
伙计们 幻视现在需要支援
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Guys! Vision needs backup, now!

1632
01:56:37,310 --> 01:56:39,060
浩克 浩克
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hulk? Hulk,

1633
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:41,150
我知道你喜欢在最后关头出场
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I know you like making your entrance at the last second.

1634
01:56:41,150 --> 01:56:43,650
现在就是了 哥们 现在就是最后关头
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second.

1635
01:56:48,190 --> 01:56:49,650
浩克 浩克
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hulk! Hulk!

1636
01:56:50,530 --> 01:56:51,530
浩克
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hulk!

1637
01:56:52,660 --> 01:56:55,160
我不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No!

1638
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:58,080
去你的 你这个绿色大饭桶
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, screw you, you big, green asshole!

1639
01:56:58,080 --> 01:56:59,250
我自己上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'll do it myself!

1640
01:57:00,160 --> 01:57:02,040
来呀
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come on! Yeah!

1641
01:57:14,350 --> 01:57:16,060
拜拜咯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}See ya!

1642
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:30,110
浩克 我们得好好谈谈了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.

1643
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:43,000
我还以为你有多厉害呢 机器人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I thought you were formidable, machine.

1644
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:46,380
但你却要死了 像所有凡人一样
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But you're dying, like any man.

1645
01:57:55,050 --> 01:57:56,260
快离开这里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Get outta here!

1646
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:00,640
快走
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Go!

1647
01:58:19,410 --> 01:58:21,160
真恶心
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That was really gross.

1648
01:58:48,270 --> 01:58:49,360
我不是叫你走了吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I thought I told you to go.

1649
01:58:50,820 --> 01:58:52,780
我们从不以命换命 这是队长你说的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We don't trade lives, Captain.

1650
01:59:04,210 --> 01:59:06,460
我接住你了 我接住你了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I got you. I got you.

1651
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:08,460
不好意思我记不住大家的名字
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names.

1652
01:59:53,670 --> 01:59:55,340
你的花样还真多 巫师
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're full of tricks, wizard.

1653
01:59:57,340 --> 02:00:00,260
但你却一次也没用过你最强大的武器
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yet you never once used your greatest weapon.

1654
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:04,680
假的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A fake.

1655
02:00:12,570 --> 02:00:16,280
你要是再拿月球砸我 我就要发狂了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna lose it.

1656
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:17,530
史塔克
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stark.

1657
02:00:17,530 --> 02:00:18,610
你认识我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know me?

1658
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:20,820
当然认识
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I do.

1659
02:00:20,870 --> 02:00:24,160
你可不是唯一一个被知识诅咒的人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.

1660
02:00:24,870 --> 02:00:26,370
我唯一的诅咒就是你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}My only curse is you.

1661
02:00:28,830 --> 02:00:29,830
来吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come on!

1662
02:00:57,780 --> 02:00:59,740
忙活那么久就为了让我出点血
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All that for a drop of blood.

1663
02:01:43,780 --> 02:01:45,620
你赢得了我的尊敬 史塔克
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You have my respect, Stark.

1664
02:01:47,370 --> 02:01:50,540
等我成功后 一半的人类还会活着
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive.

1665
02:01:55,960 --> 02:01:58,210
我希望他们会记得你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I hope they remember you.

1666
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:08,970
住手
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stop.

1667
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:16,400
放他一条生路
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Spare his life...

1668
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:19,820
我就把原石交给你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and I will give you the stone.

1669
02:02:23,490 --> 02:02:24,700
别耍花招
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No tricks.

1670
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:30,540
不要
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Don't.

1671
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:23,670
还剩一颗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}One to go.

1672
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:34,890
他去哪儿了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where is he?

1673
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:45,400
我们输了吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Did we just lose?

1674
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:51,080
你为什么要那么做
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Why would you do that?

1675
02:03:54,540 --> 02:03:56,750
我们已经没戏唱了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We're in the endgame now.

1676
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:24,110
你没事吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Are you okay?

1677
02:04:26,030 --> 02:04:27,860
怎么了 怎么回事
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What? What is it?

1678
02:04:29,910 --> 02:04:31,030
他来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He's here.

1679
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:45,090
所有人注意 我的位置 有敌人来袭
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Everyone, on my position. We have incoming.

1680
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:49,840
什么鬼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What the hell?

1681
02:05:15,490 --> 02:05:16,490
队长
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Cap.

1682
02:05:17,080 --> 02:05:18,660
就是他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's him.

1683
02:05:20,660 --> 02:05:23,130
全体集中注意 保持警惕
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1684
02:05:47,730 --> 02:05:48,730
旺达
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wanda.

1685
02:05:49,820 --> 02:05:51,200
是时候了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's time.

1686
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:52,530
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No.

1687
02:05:52,530 --> 02:05:54,820
他们阻止不了他 旺达 但我们可以
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can.

1688
02:05:54,820 --> 02:05:56,490
看着我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Look at me.

1689
02:05:56,490 --> 02:05:57,700
你有能力摧毁原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You have the power to destroy the stone.

1690
02:05:57,700 --> 02:05:58,790
不行
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Don't.

1691
02:05:58,790 --> 02:05:59,870
你必须得这么做 旺达 求你了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You must do it. Wanda, please.

1692
02:06:01,870 --> 02:06:04,540
我们已经没有时间了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We are out of time.

1693
02:06:05,170 --> 02:06:06,630
我做不到
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I can't.

1694
02:06:06,630 --> 02:06:07,960
不 你可以的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yes, you can.

1695
02:06:08,670 --> 02:06:09,880
你能做到
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You can.

1696
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:13,720
如果他得到了原石 宇宙中一半的人都会死
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.

1697
02:06:16,010 --> 02:06:17,640
这不公平
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's not fair.

1698
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:20,470
这不该由你来做 但只能如此
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It shouldn't be you, but it is.

1699
02:06:22,230 --> 02:06:23,810
没关系的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's all right.

1700
02:06:25,150 --> 02:06:26,900
你不会伤害到我的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You could never hurt me.

1701
02:06:35,950 --> 02:06:37,780
我感受到你了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I just feel you.

1702
02:08:00,910 --> 02:08:01,990
没事的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's all right.

1703
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:13,210
没关系的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's all right.

1704
02:08:17,680 --> 02:08:18,760
我爱你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I love you.

1705
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,120
我明白你的感受 我的孩子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I understand, my child.

1706
02:08:51,750 --> 02:08:53,250
比任何人都明白
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Better than anyone.

1707
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,920
你永远也不会懂
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You could never.

1708
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:04,810
我今天所失去的远比你想象的还要多
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Today, I lost more than you can know.

1709
02:09:06,430 --> 02:09:09,140
但我现在没有时间去哀悼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But now is no time to mourn.

1710
02:09:11,350 --> 02:09:15,360
现在没有时间
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Now is no time at all.

1711
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:39,800
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No!

1712
02:10:37,770 --> 02:10:39,150
我告诉过你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I told you...

1713
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:42,320
你会偿命的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you'd die for that.

1714
02:10:56,790 --> 02:10:58,420
你应该
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You should have...

1715
02:11:01,130 --> 02:11:02,470
你应该
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You should...

1716
02:11:05,090 --> 02:11:08,300
你应该朝着我的头砍
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You should have gone for the head.

1717
02:11:10,220 --> 02:11:11,220
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No!

1718
02:11:44,550 --> 02:11:45,930
