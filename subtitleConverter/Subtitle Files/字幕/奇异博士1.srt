我需要专家 尼克诊断脑死

35
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,750
我觉得不太对劲
Something about that doesn't feel right to me.

36
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,780

我不需要你同意 已经宣布脑死了
I don't need you to. We've already called brain death.

还有救 得帮他切除枕下颅骨
Prematurely.

43
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,586

我不会让你帮死人开刀
Not gonna let you operate on a dead man.

- 子弹？ - 一颗完美的子弹

47
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,940
它经过硬化处理 铅锑合金可使子弹硬化
It's been hardened. You harden a bullet by alloying lead with antimony.

48
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,650
它是有毒金属 已直接溶入脊髓液

病人还没死 但有生命危险
The patient's not dead, but he is dying. Still want to harvest his organs?

还想摘他的器官吗？

53
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,250
- 我协助你 - 不用
-I'll assist you. -No.

54
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,150

You can't do it freehand.

59
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,020

How about 10 minutes ago

62
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,860

00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,420
脑神经完整无损
Cranial nerves intact.

64
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,730
魏医师 盖住你的手表
Doctor west, cover your watch.

65
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,120
你没必要在大家面前羞辱他
You know, you didn't have to humiliate him in front of everyone.

66
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,710
我也没必要救他的病人
I didn't have to save his patient, either.

67
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,450
但我有时就是手痒
But I sometimes just can't help myself.

68
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,900

00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,160
是你来找我的
You came to me.

70
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,670
对 我需要第二意见
Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.

71
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,790
你已经有了第二意见
You had a second opinion. What you needed was a competent one.

72
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,310
你需要的是高手

73
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,640
那你更该来当我的神经外科顾问
Well, all the more reason why you should be my neurosurgeon on call.

74
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,130
你可以救更多的人
You could make such a difference.

75
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,800
我不能在你的屠宰场工作
I can't work in your butcher shop.

76
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,180

77
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,440
刺激中枢神经系统的神经生成

在急诊室只能救被枪击的醉汉
In er, you get to save one drunk idiot with a gun.

80
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,390
你说得对
Yeah, you're right.

81
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,930
我们在急诊室只是救人
In er, we're only saving lives.

82
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,560
没有名望 也没人来采访
There's no fame, there's no CNN interviews.

83
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,510
看来我只好将就用尼克了
I guess I'll just have to stick with nic.

84
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,650
等一下
Wait a minute. You're not... You guys aren't...

85
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,000
你没有…你们该不会…

86
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,310
什么？
What?

87
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,150
炮友？抱歉 我以为我够含蓄了
Sleeping together? Sorry, I thought that was implicit in my disgust.

88
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,780
一点也不含蓄
Explicit, actually.

89
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,110
我才不来办公室恋情那一套
No, I have a very strict rule against dating colleagues.

90
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,190
是吗？
-Oh, really? -I call it the "strange policy."

91
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,420
这叫史传奇原则

92
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,990
赞 我的名字成了专有名词
Good, I'm glad something's named after me.

93
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,420
我发明了椎板切除术
I invented a laminectomy procedure.

94
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,390
却没人想叫它史传奇手术
And yet, somehow

95
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,367
no one seems to want to call it the "strange technique."

96
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,910
那是我们一起发明的
We invented that technique.

97
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,500
总之 你的原则让我受宠若惊
Regardless, I'm very flattered by your policy.

98

今晚我要在神经外科学会晚宴演讲

不 是你很开心
No! You had fun.

105
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,190
那与我们无关 重点在你身上
They weren't about us, they were about you.

106
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,350
重点不只在我
Not only about me.

史蒂芬 任何事的重点都在你身上
Stephen. Everything is about you.

108
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,940

Yeah, you want me to screw up my perfect record?

121
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,140
想得美
Definitely not.

122
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,540

他们出动直升机去救你

让我看到你有用力

156
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,330
这样没用
This is useless.

157
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,580
才怪 你做得到
It's not useless, man. You can do this.

158
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,090
那回答我 大学毕业生
All right, answer me this, bachelor's degree.

159
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,830
你知道谁神经受损这么严重
Have you ever known anyone with nerve damage this severe

160
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,510
做了复健
to do this...

161
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,840
然后完全康复？
And actually recover?

162
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,470
有一个男的

163

在工厂发生意外 背部受伤

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,560
一周来三次
He came in three times a week. Then one day he stopped coming.

167
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,920
有一天就不来了

168
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,940
我以为他死了
I thought he was dead.

169
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,110
几年后 他在街上跟我擦身而过
A few years later, he walked past me on the street.

170
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,750
- 用走的？ - 对 用走的

171
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,650
鬼扯 拿他病历给我看
Bullshit. Show me his file.

172
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,450
找病历要一点时间
It'll take me a while to pull the files from the archive.

173
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,950
不过为了让你这臭屁王心服口服
But if it proves your arrogant ass wrong...

174
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,700
值得
Worth it.

175
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,640
我拜读你所有的研究
I looked at all your research...

176
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,930
看过你寄的论文
I read all the papers you've sent.

177
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,810
那不可能成功的
It's not gonna work.

178
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,530
我想你不明白…
I don't think you realize...

179
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,060
受损有多严重 是这样的…
How severe the damages are.

180
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,380
最好的办法都失败了
-Here's the thing... -The best have tried and failed.

181
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,150
我了解 听我说
I understand. Here's the thing.

182
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,360
你要我做的事不可能成功 史蒂芬
What you want from me is impossible, Stephen.

183
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,730
别这样
Come on.

184
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,570
我也得考虑自己的名声
I've got my own reputation to consider.

185
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,450
- 艾提安 等等 - 我爱莫能助
-Etienne, wait. No. -I can't help you.

186
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,050
不 等一下
No, no, wait!

187
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,990
嘿
Hey!

188
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,960
他不答应
He won't do it.

189
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,930
他根本是蒙古大夫
He's a hack.

190
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,590
东京有一种新手术
There is a new procedure in Tokyo.

191
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,180
他们培养捐赠者的干细胞
They culture donor stem cells...

192
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,020
然后用3D列印细胞生长支架
And then harvesting them and then 3D printing a scaffold.

193
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,320
如果我能凑到钱…
If I could get a loan together...

194
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,350
史蒂芬
Stephen.

195
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,060
借20万就好
A small loan, just $200,000.

196
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,290
你一直都很会赚钱 花钱也不手软
You've always spent money as fast as you could make it...

197
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,360
但现在你根本没有钱继续这样花了
But now you're spending money you don't even have.

198
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,150
或许该考虑就此打住了
Maybe it's time to consider stopping.

199
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,610
怎么可以就此打住
No, now is exactly the time not to stop...

200
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,450
你没看到我根本没有好转吗
Because, you see, I'm not getting any better!

201
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,450
这已经无关医疗
But this isn't medicine anymore.

202
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,290
你失心疯了
This is mania.

203
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,040
有些事就是无力回天
Some things just can't be fixed.

204
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,660
- 不能工作… - 日子还是要过
-Life without my work... -Is still life.

205
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,910
这不是世界末日
This isn't the end.

206
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,840
人生有意义的事还很多
There are other things that can give your life meaning.

207
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,720
什么？你吗？
Like what? Like you?

208
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,470
请你道歉
This is the part where you apologize.

209
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,430
请你离开
This is the part where you leave.

210
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,980
好 我不忍心看你这样下去
Fine, I can't watch you do this to yourself anymore.

211
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,580
让你太难受了？
Too difficult for you, is it?

212
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,650
对 没错
Yes, it is.

213
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,980
看你这样折磨自己我心都碎了
It breaks my heart to see you this way.

214
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,230
- 不 别可怜我 - 我不是可怜你
-No, don't pity me. -I'm not pitying you.

215
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,710
是吗？那你带起司和酒来
Oh, yeah? Then what are you doing here...

216
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,040
一副老朋友要野餐的样子是干嘛？
Bringing cheese and wine like we're old friends going for a picnic?

217
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,320
我们不是朋友 克莉丝汀
We are not friends, Christine.

218
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,740
以前也算不上情侣
We were barely lovers.

219
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,660
你就是喜欢悲伤的故事 对吧？
But you just love a sob story, don't you?

220
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,120
我在你眼中是那么回事吗？
Is that what I am to you now?

221
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,870
可怜的史蒂芬史传奇 令人同情
"Poor Stephen strange, charity case."

222
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
他终于需要我了
"He finally needs me."

223
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,880
又一个需要你拯救的人渣
Another dreg of humanity for you to work on.

224
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,330
把他治好 让他回到社会上

225
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,920
心脏还能跳就好

226
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,340
你超有爱心 对不对？
You care so much, don't you?

227
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,840
再见 史蒂芬
Goodbye, Stephen.

00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,760
- 我不认识你 - 我是史蒂芬史传奇
-I don't know you. -I'm Stephen strange.

244
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,930
神经外科医师 以前啦

245
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,630
其实我认识你
Actually, you know what, man, i do know you.

246
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,520
我去过你门诊 你不肯帮我看
I came to your office once. You refused to see me.

247
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,100
你的助理不让我见你
I never got past your assistant.

248
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,270
当时你无法治疗
You were untreatable.

249
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,770
反正对你没好处 是吧？
No glory for you in that, right?

250
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,020
你竟然奇蹟式地完全恢复
You came back from a place there's no way back from.

251
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,690
我也想回到以前的自己
I'm trying to find my own way back.

252
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,710
潘柏恩 打不打？
Pangborn, are you in or you out?

253
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,300
好
All right.

254
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,590
我本来已经放弃我的身体了
I'd given up on my body.

255
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,050
我想既然只剩下脑袋
I thought my mind's the only thing i have left...

256
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,010
我至少应该设法提升它的能力
I should at least try to elevate that.

257
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,630
所以我和心灵导师
So, I sat with gurus...

258
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,430
以及神圣之女一起钻研
And sacred women.

259
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,470
有陌生人带我到山上见圣者
Strangers carried me to mountaintops to see holy men.

260
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
最后…
And finally...

261
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,480
我找到了我的导师
I found my teacher.

262
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,150
我的心智获得提升
And my mind was elevated...

263

性灵更加深化
And my spirit deepened.

264
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,440
不知不觉中…
And somehow...

265
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,610
你的身体也痊愈了
Your body healed.

266
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,820
是
Yes.

267
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,450
那里有更深奥的秘密可以学习
There were deeper secrets to learn there...

268
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,430
但我没有力气吸收它们
But I didn't have the strength to receive them.

269
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,250
我选择带着自己复原的奇蹟回家
I chose to settle for my miracle and I came back home.

270
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,720
你要找的地方叫卡玛泰姬
The place you're looking for is called kamar-taj.

271
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,130
但是付出的代价很高
But the cost there is high.

272
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,130
多少钱？
How much?

273
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,890
我讲的不是钱
I'm not talking about money.

274
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,350
祝你好运
Good luck.

275
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,640

Your watch.

290
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,150

Sure we got the right place?

296
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,530
那边比较像卡玛泰姬
That one looks a little more kamar-tajey.

297
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,080
我曾经跟你一样
I once stood in your place.

298
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,670
目中无人
And I, too, was disrespectful.

299
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,040
方便给你一点建议吗？
So, might I offer you some advice?

300
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,420
放下你所有的自以为是

00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,400
他的本名呢？

306
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,110
对
Right.

307
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,740
放下我所有的自以为是 抱歉
Forget everything I think I know. Sorry.

308
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,290
谢谢你…
Thank you for...

309
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,630
真特别
Okay, that's a thing.

310
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,920
谢谢你…
Thank you for...

311
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,130
你好
Hello.

312
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,470
谢谢
Thank you.

313
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,430
谢谢
And thank you.

314
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,560
谢谢你…
Thank you...

315
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,440
古一 愿意见我
Ancient one, for seeing me.

316
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
别客气
You're very welcome.

317
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,320
古一
The ancient one.

318
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,320
谢谢莫度大师 谢谢哈密尔大师
Thank you, master mordo. Thank you, master hamir.

319
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,070
史传奇先生
Mr. strange.

320
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,320
其实我是医生
Doctor, actually.

321
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,950
不 再也不是了
No, not anymore, surely.

322
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,210
那不正是你来的原因吗？
Isn't that why you're here?

323
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,790
你经历了多次手术
You've undergone many procedures.

324
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,210
七次 对不对？ 对
Seven, right?

325
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:42,542
Yeah.

326
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,960
好茶
It's good tea.

327
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,290
是
Yes.

328
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,300
你是不是治好一个叫潘柏恩的
Did you heal a man named pangborn?

329
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,510
一个瘫痪的男子？
A paralyzed man?

330
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,680
可以这么说
In a way.

331
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,760
你让他又可以走路
You helped him to walk again.

332
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,970
是
Yes.

333
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,690
你如何治愈C7跟C8脊椎的伤？
How did you correct a complete c7-c8 spinal cord injury?

334
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,650
我没有治好他
I didn't correct it.

335
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,110
他不能走路
He couldn't walk.

336
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,610
我让他相信他能走
I convinced him that he could.

337
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,700
你是说那是身心症？
You're not suggesting it was psychosomatic?

338
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,740
当你重新接上受损的神经
When you reattach a severed nerve...

339
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,280
让它复原的是你还是身体？
Is it you who heals it back together or the body?

340
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
是细胞
It's the cells.

341
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,030
细胞只是接受指示
The cells are only programmed...

342
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,230
以非常特殊的方式再度聚合
To put themselves back together in very specific ways.

343
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
对
Right.

344
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,830
如果我告诉你 你的身体能被说服
What if I told you that your own body could be convinced...

345
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,160
以各种方式自行修复呢？
To put itself back together in all sorts of ways?

346
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,340
你说的是细胞再生
You're talking about cellular regeneration.

347
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,670
那是非常先进的医学技术
That's bleeding edge medical tech.

348
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,680
那是你在这里工作的原因吗？
Is that why you're working here?

349
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,050
不受卫生组织管理？
Without a governing medical board?

350
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,100
你的疗法到底有多先进？
Just how experimental is your treatment?

351
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,180
相当了不起
Quite.

352
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,980
所以你研发出一种方法
So, you've figured out a way...

353
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,350
让神经细胞重新编排 然后自愈？
To reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

354
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,900
不 史传奇先生
No, Mr. strange.

355
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,400
我知道如何重置心灵
I know how to reorient the spirit...

356
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,190
来更有效地疗愈身体
To better heal the body.

357
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,700
- 用心灵来治疗身体？ - 没错
-The spirit to heal the body? -That's right.

358
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,830
好吧
No. All right.

359
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,990
那要怎么进行？
How do we do that?

360
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,670
从哪里开始？
Where do we start?

361
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,180
- 不喜欢这张图吗？ - 不是
-Don't like that map? -Oh, no.

362
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,430
它很棒 只是我以前…
It's really good. It's just, I've seen it before...

363
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,800
在礼品店看过
In gift shops.

364
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,930
那这张呢？
And what about this one?

365
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,560
- 针灸 太好了 - 是吗？
-Acupuncture, great. -Yeah?

366
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,690
这张呢？
What about that one?

367
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,560
给我看磁振造影扫描 我不敢相信
Showing me an mri scan. I do not believe this.

368
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,240
画这些图的人
Each of those maps was drawn up by someone...

369
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,020
都只能看到部分 见树不见林
Who could see in part, but not the whole.

370
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,590
我花光积蓄 买单程机票过来
I spent my last dollar getting here, one-way ticket...

371
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,830
你却大谈用意志力治疗？
And you're talking to me about healing through belief?

372
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,420
你是个坐井观天的人
You're a man looking at the world through a keyhole.

373
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,430
穷尽一生想扩展眼界
You've spent your whole life trying to widen that keyhole...

374
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,080
开拓视野 增广见闻
To see more, to know more.

375
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,260
现在你听到眼界真能被扩大
Now, on hearing that it can be widened...

376
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,260
只是用超乎想像的方法
In ways you can't imagine...

377
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,920
你又拒绝那种可能性
You reject the possibility.

378
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,560
不 那是因为我不相信…
No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales...

379
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,260
脉轮或能量之类的神话
About chakras or energy...

380
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,010
也不相信信仰的力量
Or the power of belief.

381
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,180
根本没有灵魂这种东西
There is no such thing as spirit!

382
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,810
人类是由物质所构成的 没有别的
We are made of matter...

383
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,150
你只不过是冰冷宇宙中
And nothing more.

384
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:10,322
You're just another tiny, momentary speck

385
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,560
另一粒无足轻重的微尘
within an indifferent universe.

386
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,270
你太小看自己了
You think too little of yourself.

387
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,660
你以为你看透我了吗？并没有
You think you see through me, do you? Well, you don't.

388
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,610
可是我却看透了你
But I see through you!

389
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,720
你刚刚对我做了什么？
What did you just do to me?

390
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,970
我把你的灵体推出肉体
I pushed your astral form out of your physical form.

391
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,690
茶里加了什么？
What's in that tea?

392
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,480
魔菇？迷幻药？
Psilocybin? LSD?

393
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,260
只是一般的茶
It's just tea...

394
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,390
加了点蜂蜜
With a little honey.

395
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,190
刚刚发生什么事？
What just happened?

396
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,690
刚刚你短暂进入了星灵界
For a moment, you entered the astral dimension.

397
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,770
什么？
The what?

398
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,900
一个灵魂脱离肉体的地方
A place where the soul exists apart from the body.

399
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,900
你为何这样对我？
Why are you doing this to me?

400
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,490
让你知道自己有多么无知
To show you just how much you don't know.

401
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,620
睁开眼睛
Open your eye.

402
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,950
靠！
Oh, shit!

403
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,500
天啊 不…
Oh, god! Oh, god, no!

404
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,040
不…
No, no, no!

405
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,210
发生什么事？
What's happening?

406
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,470
这不是真的
This isn't real!

407
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,020
他的心跳快到可能有危险
His heart rate is getting dangerously high.

408
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,360
我觉得他看起来还好
He looks all right to me.

409
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,700
你自以为明白世界的运行之道
You think you know how the world works?

410
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,080
自以为你所知的物质宇宙就是一切
You think that this material universe is all there is?

411
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,500
何谓真实？
What is real?

412
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,590
超越感官之外还有什么秘密？
What mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses?

413
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,100
在存在的根源
At the root of existence...

414
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,350
性灵与物质交会
Mind and matter meet.

415
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,390
思想形塑现实
Thoughts shape reality.

416
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,990
宇宙之外还有无限个宇宙
This universe is only one of an infinite number.

417
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,740
没有尽头的无限世界
Worlds without end.

418
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,950
有的仁慈 孕育生命
Some benevolent and life giving.

419
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,590
有的充满恶意与饥渴
Others filled with malice and hunger.

420
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,460
在那些黑暗之处
Dark places...

421
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:48,430
比时间更古老的力量虎视眈眈
Where powers older than time lie ravenous...

422
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,350
蛰伏等待
And waiting.

423
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:07,200
在这多重宇宙里 你是谁 史传奇先生？
Who are you in this vast multiverse, Mr. strange?

424
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,380
这些你在礼品店里看过了吗？
Have you seen that before in a gift shop?

425
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,600
教我
Teach me.

426
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,360
不
No.

427
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,200
不
No.

428
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
不
No!

429
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,490
不…
No, no, no!

430
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,750
不
No!

431
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,120
开门 求求你
Open the door! Please!

432
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,670
谢谢各位大师
Thank you, masters.

433
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,140
你觉得我不该赶他走？
You think I was wrong to cast him out?

434
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,590
五小时后 他还会在门口
5 hours later, he's still on your doorstep.

435
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,390
他很顽强
There's a strength to him.

436
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:16,180
固执、自大、野心
Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition. I've seen it all before.

437
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,940
我全都见过

438
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,150
他让你想起卡西流斯？
He reminds you of kaecilius?

439
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,070
我不能带领另一个天赋异禀的学生
I cannot lead another gifted student to power...

440
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,400
获得力量却坠入邪恶深渊
Only to lose him to the darkness.

441
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,860
我并没有掉进去
You didn't lose me.

442
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,530
我想获得击退敌人的能力
I wanted the power to defeat my enemies.

443
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:36,240
你赋予我战胜心魔的力量
You gave me the power to defeat my demons.

444
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:39,290
生活在自然法则里的力量
And to live within the natural law.

445
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,590
心魔始终不曾远离我们 莫度
We never lose our demons, mordo.

446
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,710
我们只是学会与它们共处
We only learn to live above them.

447
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:50,170
遗失的书页还在卡西流斯手上
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

448
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,630
一旦他破解了内容 就有可能…
If he deciphers them, he could bring ruin...

449
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,140
将毁灭降临世界
Upon us all.

450
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,980
未来恐怕有一场腥风血雨
There may be dark days ahead.

451
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,850
或许卡玛泰姬用得上史传奇这种人
Perhaps kamar-taj could use a man like strange.

452
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,780
不要拒我于门外
Don't shut me out.

453
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,660
我无处可去
I haven't got anywhere else to go.

454
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,580
谢谢
Thank you.

455
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,970
沐浴
Bathe.

456
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,300
休息
Rest.

457
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,630
可以的话…
Meditate...

458
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,640
冥想
If you can.

459
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,850
古一会派人来叫你
The ancient one will send for you.

460
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:44,990
香巴拉

461
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,540
香巴拉
What's this? My mantra?

462
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,100
香巴拉

463
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,150
香巴拉

464
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,940
这是什么？我的梵咒吗？

466
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,490
我们不是野蛮人好吗？
We're not savages.

● 时间会告诉你\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h 我有多么爱你\h\h\h\h\h --\h\h\h 克丽丝汀

469
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,330
● 时间会告诉你\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h 我有多么爱你\h\h\h\h\h --\h\h\h 克丽丝汀

470
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,450
● 时间会告诉你\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h 我有多么爱你\h\h\h\h\h --\h\h\h 克丽丝汀

471
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,980
神秘之术的语言
The language of the mystic arts...

472
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,650
与文明一样古老
Is as old as civilization.

473
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,190
古代的魔法师
The sorcerers of antiquity...

474
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,160
将这种语言称为咒语
Called the use of this language "spells."

475
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,380
如果这名词不够时髦
But if that word offends your modern sensibilities...

476
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,910
你可以称之为程式
You can call it a "program."

477
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:45,090
塑造现实的原始码
The source code that shapes reality.

478
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,040
我们驾驭…
We harness energy...

479
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:52,670
来自多重宇宙中其他次元的能量
Drawn from other dimensions of the multiverse...

480
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,760
施展咒语

创造神奇魔法
To make magic.

484
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:22,080
就算我手指比得出来
But even if my fingers could do that...

485
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,830
也只像在做外丹功而已
My hands would just be waving in the air.

486
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,080
我要如何达到你的境界？
How do I get from here to there?

487
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,720
你如何接上受损神经
How did you get to reattach severed nerves...

488
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,390
将脊椎一节一节装回去？
And put a human spine back together bone by bone?

489
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,970
多年的学习钻研与练习
Study and practice, years of it.

490
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,560
嗨

你是？ 王
And you are?

王
Wong.

495
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:57,453
Wong.

496
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,150
就一个字 王？
Just wong?

497
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,990
像爱黛儿那样？
Like Adele?

498
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,570
或者亚里斯多德
Or Aristotle.

499
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,330
史瑞克

全都看完了？
You finished all of these?

507
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
对
Yup.

508
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,310
跟我来
Come with me.

509
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,530
好
All right.

510
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,480
这一区仅供大师使用
This section is for masters only...

511
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:38,030
但我有权决定其他人可否使用
But at my discretion, others may use it.

512
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,620
你应该从《箴言入门》开始
You should start with Maxim's primer.

513
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,030
你懂梵文吗？
How's your sanskrit?

514
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,120
我很会用谷歌翻译
I'm fluent in Google translate.

515
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,000
吠陀 早期的梵文
Vedic, classical sanskrit.

516
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
那些是什么？
What are those?

517
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,760
古一的私人藏书
The ancient one's private collection.

518
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,140
不准看吗？
So, they're forbidden?

519
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,810
卡玛泰姬的知识都不是禁忌
No knowledge in kamar-taj is forbidden.

520
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,770
除了某些特例
Only certain practices.

521
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,600
那些书太高深
Those books are far too advanced

522
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,780
唯有至尊魔法师才能领略
for anyone other than the sorcerer supreme.

523
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,830
这本书有几页不见了

524
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,290
那是《卡里欧斯卓之书》
That's the book of cagliostro.

525
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,120
关于时间的研究

526
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:34,080
有一种仪式被过去的一位大师偷走

527
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,880
狂热者 卡西流斯
The zealot, kaecilius.

528
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,920
他先把图书馆员吊起来
Just after he strung up the former librarian...

529
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,510
然后砍了他的头
And relieved him of his head.

530
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,050
现在我负责守护这些书
I am now the guardian of these books.

531
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,850
万一里面有一本又被偷走
So if a volume from this collection should be stolen again...

532
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,360
我一定会知道
I'd know it...

533
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:57,730
你还没出大门就会丢掉小命
And you'd be dead before you ever left the compound.

534
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,530
如果只是逾期未还呢？
What if it's just overdue?

535
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,900
有逾期罚款吗？会残废？
Any late fees I should know about? Maiming, perhaps?

536
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,540
以前人家都觉得我很幽默
People used to think that I was funny.

537
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:13,920
他们是你的下属吗？
Did they work for you?

538
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,210
好吧 很开心跟你聊天
All right. It's been lovely talking to you.

539
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,130
谢谢你借我这些书
Thank you for the books...

540
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,430
讲这么恐怖的故事
And for the horrifying story...

541
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,350
还有威胁我的性命
And for the threat upon my life.

542
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:57,410
我们将获得歼灭背叛者的力量
We will now receive the power to destroy the one who betrayed us.

543
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,090
背叛这个世界的人
The one who betrays the world.

544
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,370
我们召唤你 魔王

545
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,790
听到召唤

546
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:08,370
就请到我们的身边来

547
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,870
让我们看到你们的真面目

548
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,870
我们在召唤

549
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:48,730
再来

550
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,230
收

551
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:52,570
放

552
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:53,870
接

553
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,070
集中

554
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:58,070
触发

555
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,970
先到这儿

556
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,280
灵环的活用是秘术的关键
Mastery of the sling ring is essential to the mystic arts.

557
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,940
它们能让我们在多重宇宙中穿梭
They allow us to travel throughout the multiverse.

558
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,490
你们只需要专注
All you need to do is focus.

559
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,540
视觉化
Visualize.

560
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,960
在脑海中看见目的地
See the destination in your mind.

561
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,130
眼光超越眼前的世界
Look beyond the world in front of you.

562
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,130
想像每个细节
Imagine every detail.

563
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,390
画面越清晰 入口就越快…
The clearer the picture, the quicker and easier...

564
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,850
越容易出现
The gateway will come.

565
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,600
停
And stop.

566
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,310
我想与史传奇先生单独谈谈
I would like a moment alone with Mr. strange.

567
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,110
没问题
Of course.

568
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,520
我的手
My hands.

569
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,780
重点不在你的手
It's not about your hands.

570
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,990
怎么不是？
How is this not about my hands?

571
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,650
哈密尔大师
Master hamir.

572
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,460
谢谢你 哈密尔大师
Thank you, master hamir.

573
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,600
你无法让河流听命于你
You cannot beat a river into submission.

574
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,640
而必须臣服于它的水流
You have to surrender to its current...

575
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,050
借用它的力量
And use its power as your own.

576
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,390
靠伏首称臣来控制它？
I control it by surrendering control? That doesn't make any sense.

577
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,890
根本没道理

578
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,440
万物并非皆有道理 也非必有道理
Not everything does. Not everything has to.

579
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,690
你的才智让你成就傲人
Your intellect has taken you far in life...

580
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,320
但仅止于此
But it will take you no further.

581
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,810
伏首称臣吧 史蒂芬
Surrender, Stephen.

582
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,020
放下你的自我
Silence your ego...

583
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,190
力量就会油然而生
And your power will rise.

584
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,250
跟我来
Come with me.

585
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,460
等一下
Wait.

586
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,500
- 这是… - 圣母峰
-Is this... -Everest.

587
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,180
好美
Beautiful.

588
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,760
对 美呆了
Yeah, right, beautiful.

589
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,340
冷毙了 但很美
Freezing but beautiful.

590
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,860
在这种温度下
At this temperature...

591
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,010
一个人只能撑30分钟
A person can last for 30 minutes...

592
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,680
然后永久失去身体机能
Before suffering permanent loss of function.

593
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:57,930
好极了
Great.

594
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:00,480
不过两分钟就可能休克
But you'll likely go into shock within the first two.

595
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,890
什么？ 伏首称臣吧 史蒂芬
What?

596
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,110
不！
Surrender, Stephen.

597
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:05,364
No!

598
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,100
菜鸟的表现如何？
How's our new recruit?

599
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,240
等着瞧
We shall see.

600
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,750
马上就会看到
Any second now.

601
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,130
最好别再来一遍
No, not again.

602
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,460
或许我该…
Maybe I should...

603
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,710
史蒂芬
Stephen.

604
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:46,950
王
Wong.

605
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,060
你要什么 史传奇？
What do you want, strange?

606
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,500
灵魂出窍的书
Books on astral projection.

607
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,590
你还没准备好
You're not ready for that.

608
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,010
放马过来 碧昂丝
Try me, Beyoncé.

609
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,470
少来 你一定听过她
Oh, come on. You've heard of her.

610
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:59,930
她是流行天后耶
She's a huge star, right?

611
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,890
你这辈子笑过吗？
Do you ever laugh?

612
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,770
快点 拿书给我
Come on, just give me the book.

613
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:08,900
不行
No.

614
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,000
你曾经在这里
Once, in this room, you begged me to let you learn.

615
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:40,430
求我让你学习

616
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,430
现在我却听说你质疑每项课程
Now, I'm told you question every lesson...

617
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:45,100
宁可自学
Preferring to teach yourself.

618
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:47,160
你曾经在这里叫我睁开眼睛
Once, in this room, you told me to open my eye.

619
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,100
现在却又叫我盲目接受…
Now, I'm being told to blindly accept rules...

620
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:50,600
毫无道理的规定
That make no sense.

621
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:53,730
像是不准在图书馆里召唤入口？
Like the rule against conjuring a gateway in the library?

622
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,360
王打我小报告？
Wong told on me?

623
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,030
你的法术能力进步神速
You're advancing quickly with your sorcery skills.

624
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,780
需要安全的地方练习施咒
You need a safe space to practice your spells.

625
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,260
你正在镜次元里
You are now inside the mirror dimension...

626
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:24,090
它始终存在却无法察觉
Ever present but undetected.

627
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,300
现实世界不受这里所影响
The real world isn't affected by what happens here.

628
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:31,440
我们运用镜次元训练、监督
We use the mirror dimension to train, surveil...

629
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,570
有时将威胁困住
And sometimes to contain threats.

630
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,880
没有灵环被困在这里就惨了
You don't wanna be stuck in here without your sling ring.

631
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,700
慢着 抱歉 你刚说威胁？
Hold on. Sorry. What do you mean, "threats?"

632
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:53,460
学习无限的多重宇宙 也包括学习无限的危险
Learning of an infinite multiverse includes learning of infinite dangers.

633
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:56,760
要是我把你不知道的事都告诉你
If I told you everything else that you don't already know...

634
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,380
你会吓到逃走
You'd run from here in terror.

635
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,850
她到底有多老？
So just how ancient is she?

636
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,560
没有人知道至尊魔法师的年龄
No one knows the age of the sorcerer supreme.

637
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,520
只知道她是凯尔特人 从不谈她的过去
Only that she's Celtic and never talks about her past.

638
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,530
你追随她 连你都不知道？
You follow her, even though you don't know?

639
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,650
我知道她稳如泰山
I know she's steadfast...

640
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:20,280
却也难以预料
But unpredictable.

641
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,740
无情却又仁慈
Merciless, yet kind.

642
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,370
她造就了今天的我
She made me what I am.

643
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,370
相信你的导师
Trust your teacher...

644
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,250
不要迷失方向
And don't lose your way.

645
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:31,530
像卡西流斯那样？
Like kaecilius?

646
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:32,950
没错
That's right.

647
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,210
你认识他
You knew him.

648
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,250
他来找我们时
When he first came to us...

649
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,550
他失去了所有心爱的人
He'd lost everyone he ever loved.

650
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,550
他悲痛欲绝 想在秘术中寻找答案
He was a grieving, broken man

651
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:47,719
searching for answers in the mystic arts.

652
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:51,560
他是优秀的学生 却骄傲固执
A brilliant student, but he was proud, headstrong.

653
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,720
质疑古一 拒绝她的指导
He questioned the ancient one, rejected her teaching.

654
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,160
他离开了卡玛泰姬
He left kamar-taj.

655
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:05,780
门徒像绵羊般跟随他
His disciples followed him like sheep. Seduced by false doctrine.

656
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,830
受到错误教义的引诱

657
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,330
他偷走禁忌仪式 对吧？
And he stole the forbidden ritual, right?

658
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,410
对
Yes.

659
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:12,750
那仪式是做什么的？
What did it do?

660
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,420
不能再问了
No more questions.

661
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:19,010
那是什么？
What's that?

662
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,330
你又在问了
That's a question.

663
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,930
这是一个法器
This is a relic.

664
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:25,930
有的魔法太过强大
Some magic is too powerful to sustain...

665
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:27,290
所以我们将它灌输到物体中
So we imbue objects with it...

666
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,560
让法器代我们去承受
Allowing them to take the strain we cannot.

667
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,600
这是…
This is the staff...

668
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,400
生命法庭的权杖
Of the living tribunal.

669
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,310
有许多法器
There are many relics.

670
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,280
瓦图姆魔杖
The wand of watoomb.

671
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,900
伏特尔的拱靴
The vaulting boots of valtorr.

672
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:46,900
念起来真像顺口溜
Really just roll off the tongue, don't they?

673
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,660
我何时会有自己的法器？ 等你准备好的时候
When do I get my relic?

674
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:51,120
我想我准备好了
When you're ready.

675
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,960
那得由法器来决定
I think I'm ready.

676
00:47:51,455 --> 00:47:53,965
You're ready when the relic decides you're ready.

677
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:55,870
现在…
For now...

678
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:57,870
召唤一项武器
Conjure a weapon.

679
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,620
好
All right.

680
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,140
尽力反击
Fight!

681
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,770
像生死交关那样拼命
Fight like your life depended on it.

682
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,350
因为有一天…
Because one day...

683
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,860
可能救你一命
It may.

684
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:43,000
克莉丝汀

685
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:51,580
克莉丝汀 我再写一封电子邮件给你

686
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:31,210
王？
Wong?

687
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:44,890
好
Okay.

688
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,110
首先 打开阿迦莫托之眼
"First, open the eye of agamotto."

689
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:10,510
好
All right.

690
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,160
天啊
Oh, my.

691
00:50:49,842 --> 00:50:50,972
What if...

692
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:14,070
多玛暮
"Dormammu."

693
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:16,990
黑暗次元
"The dark dimension."

694
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,410
永生？
Eternal life?

695
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:26,870
住手
What the...

696
00:51:26,128 --> 00:51:26,998
Stop!

697
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:33,170
破坏时间连续性是被严格禁止的
Tampering with continuum probabilities is forbidden.

698
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,800
我只是照书上的指示
I was just doing exactly what it said in the book.

699
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:37,210
书上说
What did the book say about the dangers of performing that ritual?

700
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,860
执行这仪式会有什么危险？

701
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,530
不知道 我还没看到那里
I don't know. I hadn't gotten to that part yet.

702
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:43,560
操控时间可能造成时间错位
Temporal manipulations can create branches in time.

703
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,970
导致次元入口失序
Unstable dimensional openings.

704
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,360
空间矛盾 时间不断循环
Spatial paradoxes! Time loops!

705
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,490
你想要永远重复
You wanna get stuck reliving the same moment

706
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:51,860
同一个时刻
over and over forever...

707
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,280
还是根本没存在过？
Or never having existed at all?

708
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:56,940
他们应该在咒语前面加上警语
Really should put the warnings before the spell.

709
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,990
好奇心会要人命的
Your curiosity could have gotten you killed.

710
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,410
你不是在操控时空连续性
You weren't manipulating the space-time continuum...

711
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:02,490
而是在破坏它
You were breaking it.

712
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:05,880
我们不能窜改自然法则
We do not tamper with natural law. We defend it.

713
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:06,950
而是要保护它

714
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,500
你到底怎么弄的？
How did you even do that?

715
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,040
你怎么看得懂它所需的长串咒语？
Where did you learn the litany of spells required to even understand it?

716
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:14,350
我过目不忘
I've got a photographic memory.

717
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,420
所以才能同时拿到 医师资格和博士学位
That's how I got my m.D. And ph.D. At the same time.

718
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,880
你刚刚所做的…
What you just did...

719
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,300
不只需要超强记忆力
Takes more than a good memory.

720
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:22,310
你天生就是秘术高手
You were born for the mystic arts.

721
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,560
但我的手还在抖
And yet my hands still shake.

722
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,930
只是暂时的
For now, yes.

723
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,230
不会这样一直下去吗？
Not forever?

724
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:28,520
我们又不是算命仙
We're not prophets.

725
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,600
你何时要跟我说我们的身分？
When are you gonna start telling me what we are?

726
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:37,490
复仇者联盟那样的英雄
While heroes like the avengers

727
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:39,860
保护世界对抗有形体的物质危险
protect the world from physical dangers...

728
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:43,410
我们魔法师则保护世界 对抗形而上的神秘威胁
We sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats.

729
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:46,960
古一是这一代的
The ancient one is the latest in a long line of sorcerers supreme...

730
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,200
至尊魔法师

731
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:52,090
他们最早可追溯到 数千年前的秘术之父
Going back thousands of years to the father of the mystic arts...

732
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,370
伟大的阿迦莫托
The mighty agamotto.

733
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:58,510
他创造了你擅自借用的这个眼睛
Same sorcerer who created the eye you so recklessly borrowed.

734
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,510
阿迦莫托在能量之地 建立三座至圣所
Agamotto built three sanctums in places of power...

735
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:05,690
那些地方如今都是大城市
Where great cities now stand.

736
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,930
那道门通往香港至圣所
That door leads to the Hong Kong sanctum.

737
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,560
那道门通往纽约至圣所
That door to the New York sanctum.

738
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:12,510
那道通往伦敦至圣所
That one to the London sanctum.

739
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,650
这些至圣所…
Together...

740
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,360
共同在我们世界周围形成防护盾
The sanctums generate a protective shield around our world.

741
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:20,530
至圣所保护世界
The sanctums protect the world...

742
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:21,950
我们魔法师…
And we sorcerers...

743
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:23,860
保护至圣所
Protect the sanctums.

744
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:25,990
为了防范什么？
From what?

745
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,780
来自其他次元的威胁
Other dimensional beings that threaten our universe.

746
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,620
像是多玛暮
Like dormammu.

747
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,500
你怎么知道这名字？
Where did you learn that name?

748
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:37,380
我在《卡里欧斯卓之书》看到的 怎么了？
I just read it in the book of cagliostro. Why?

749
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:45,140
多玛暮住在黑暗次元
Dormammu dwells in the dark dimension.

750
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,300
超越时间
Beyond time.

751
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,140
他是宇宙征服者
He is the cosmic conqueror...

752
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,150
世界破坏者
The destroyer of worlds.

753
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,990
具有无穷力量
A being of infinite power and endless hunger...

754
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,480
不断想入侵每个宇宙
On a quest to invade every universe...

755
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,280
将所有世界纳入他的黑暗次元
And bring all worlds into his dark dimension.

756
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:05,160
他最渴望的就是地球
And he hungers for earth most of all.

757
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,500
卡西流斯偷走的那几页
The pages that kaecilius stole.

758
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:11,090
那仪式能联系多玛暮
A ritual to contact dormammu

759
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,680
从黑暗次元汲取力量
and draw power from the dark dimension.

760
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,840
好吧
Okay...

761
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,510
我退出
I'm out.

762
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:24,670
我来是为了治疗我的手
I came here to heal my hands.

763
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:28,720
不是打什么神秘战争
Not to fight in some mystical war.

764
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,020
伦敦
London.

765
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:37,850
卡西流斯
Kaecilius!

766
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,150
不！
No!

767
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,250
王？莫度？
Wong? Mordo?

768
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,440
177A 布里克街

769
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,250
有人在吗？
Hello?

770
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:09,610
有人在吗？
Hello?

771
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,950
丹尼尔 原来是你当上这座至圣所的大师
Daniel, I see they made you master of this sanctum.

772
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:55,160
知道那代表什么意思吗？
You know what that means?

773
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,330
你将为了保护它而死
That you'll die protecting it.

774
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,560
住手
Stop!

775
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,240
你在卡玛泰姬待多久了…先生？
How long have you been at kamar-taj, mister...

776
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,650
医生
Doctor.

777
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:32,110
达克特先生？
Mister doctor?

778
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:34,200
史传奇
It's strange.

779
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,200
现在是流行取怪名吗？
Maybe. Who am I to judge?

780
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,310
你根本不会用吧？
You don't know how to use that, do you?

781
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:51,920
什么？
What?

782
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,300
停
Stop it.

783
01:01:58,420 --> 01:01:59,420
我叫你停下来
I said stop it.

784
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:01,070
这停不下来的 达克特先生
You cannot stop this, mister doctor.

785
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,600
我根本不知道“这”是什么
I don't even know what "this" is.

786
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,800
它是末日
It's the end...

787
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:06,810
也是开始
And the beginning.

788
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:09,720
无数次元逐渐减少 最后变成一个
The many becoming the few becoming the one.

789
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:12,950
你要再胡言乱语
If you're not gonna start making sense...

790
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:14,790
我就把这东西放回去
I'm just gonna have to put this thing back on.

791
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:15,860
告诉我 达克特先生
Tell me, mister doctor...

792
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,320
我是史蒂芬史传奇医生
My name is doctor Stephen strange.

793
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,150
- 你是医生？ - 对
-You are a doctor? -Yeah.

794
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,320
科学家
A scientist.

795
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,490
你了解自然法则
You understand the laws of nature.

796
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:27,950
万物皆会老化 皆会死去
All things age. All things die.

797
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:29,580
我们的太阳终将烧尽
In the end, our sun burns out.

798
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:31,910
我们的宇宙会变冷而毁灭
Our universe grows cold and perishes.

799
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,790
但是黑暗次元…
But the dark dimension...

800
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,630
它是个超越时间的地方
It's a place beyond time.

801
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:38,430
够了 我把这玩意放回去
That's it. I'm putting this thing back on.

802
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,020
这世界不见得要灭亡 医生
This world doesn't have to die, doctor.

803
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:42,730
这世界能找到适当的位置 跟其他许多世界
This world can take its rightful place alongside so many others...

804
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,130
构成独一宇宙
As part of the one.

805
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,680
伟大而美丽的独一宇宙
The great and beautiful one.

806
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:49,190
我们能够长生不老
We can all live forever.

807
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:50,680
是吗？
Really?

808
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:55,940
你从那个美丽乌托邦能得到什么？
What do you have to gain out of this new age dimensional utopia?

809
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:58,100
跟你一样
The same as you.

810
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:01,020
跟大家一样 生命 永生
The same as everyone. Life. Eternal life.

811
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:03,530
人们只想到善恶
People think in terms of good and evil...

812
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,540
其实时间才是我们真正的敌人
When really time is the true enemy of us all.

813
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:07,330
时间扼杀一切
Time kills everything.

814
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:09,160
那你杀的那些人呢？
What about the people you killed?

815
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:10,540
微不足道
Tiny.

816
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,080
冰冷宇宙中无足轻重的一粒微尘
Momentary specks within an indifferent universe.

817
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,080
对 你懂
Yes. You see.

818
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:19,920
你明白我们的所作所为
You see what we're doing.

819
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,290
这世界不该如此
The world is not what it ought to be.

820
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:24,880
人类渴望永恒
Humanity longs for the eternal...

821
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,680
渴望一个超越时间的世界 因为时间奴役了我们
For a world beyond time, because time is what enslaves us.

822
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,010
时间是一种羞辱
Time is an insult.

823
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:31,720
死亡是一种羞辱
Death is an insult.

824
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:34,390
医生
Doctor...

825
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:37,860
我们并不希望统治世界
We don't seek to rule this world.

826
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:39,190
我们希望拯救它
We seek to save it...

827
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:42,770
将它交给多玛暮 他是演化的终极目标
To hand it over to dormammu, who is the intent of all evolution...

828
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:45,620
所有生命存在的原因
The why of all existence.

829
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:49,530
至尊魔法师才会保护生命
The sorcerer supreme defends existence.

830
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,330
你为何来到卡玛泰姬 医生？
What was it that brought you to kamar-taj, doctor?

831
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,830
受到启蒙吗？
Was it enlightenment?

832
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:56,840
为了得到力量？
Power?

833
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:01,090
你是来被治愈的 跟我们都一样
You came to be healed, as did we all.

834
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,420
卡玛泰姬是个收破烂的地方
Kamar-taj is a place that collects broken things.

835
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,510
我们都期望能够痊愈
We all come with the promise of being healed...

836
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:10,430
古一却尽给我们一些魔术伎俩
And instead the ancient one gives us parlor tricks.

837
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,270
真正的法术她深藏不露
The real magic she keeps for herself.

838
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,690
你想过她怎么活这么久吗？
You ever wonder how she managed to live this long?

839
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:25,280
我在卡里欧斯卓之书看到那些仪式
I saw the rituals in the book of cagliostro.

840
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:27,780
所以你知道
So, you know.

841
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:29,700
那仪式能给我力量
The ritual gives me the power to overthrow the ancient one...

842
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:31,120
推翻古一

843
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,950
摧毁她的至圣所
And tear her sanctums down.

844
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:35,710
引入黑暗次元
To let the dark dimension in.

845
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:37,790
因为古一隐藏独占的法术
Because what the ancient one hoards, dormammu gives freely.

846
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,500
多玛暮却大方分享

847
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:41,830
永生
Life everlasting.

848
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,970
他不是世界的摧毁者
He's not the destroyer of worlds, doctor.

849
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,970
而是救世者
He's the savior of worlds.

850
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,260
不 怎么可能
No. I mean, come on.

851
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:51,180
看看你的脸
Look at your face.

852
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:53,730
多玛暮让你成为杀人凶手
Dormammu made you a murderer.

853
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,020
他的王国能有多美好？
Just how good can his kingdom be?

854
01:04:57,970 --> 01:04:59,520
你觉得很好笑吗？
You think that's funny?

855
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:01,650
不是
No, not that.

856
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:04,230
好笑的是你的灵环不见了
What's funny is that you've lost your sling ring.

857
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:13,680
先生 需要帮忙吗？
Sir, can I help you?

858
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,970
帕默医师 她在哪？
Doctor Palmer, where is she?

859
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:16,690
- 先生 我们需要… - 她在哪？
-Sir. We need to get... -Where is she?

860
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,220
护理站
The nurse's station.

861
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:19,400
克莉丝汀
Christine!

862
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:22,620
史蒂芬？
Stephen?

863
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:23,730
我的天啊
Oh, my god.

864
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:26,400
马上带我进手术室 你进来就好
Get me in an operating theater now. Just you.

865
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,600
快 我没时间了
Now! I haven't any time.

866
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:29,320
发生什么事？
What happened?

867
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,370
我被刺伤 心包填塞
I was stabbed. Cardiac tamponade.

868
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,900
你身上穿的是什么？
What are you wearing?

869
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:42,580
胸腔没有状况
Chest cavity is clear.

870
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:45,370
不 心包囊出血
No, the blood is in the pericardial sac.

871
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:49,510
不…
No, no, no.

872
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:50,590
史蒂芬？
Stephen?

873
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:53,390
天啊
Come on, come on.

874
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:57,470
心跳率过低

875
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:21,330
高一点
Just a little higher.

876
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,940
用针拜托小心点
Please be careful with the needle.

877
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:26,870
史蒂芬
Stephen?

878
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:30,630
我看到了什么？
What am I seeing?

879
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,670
我的灵体
My astral body.

880
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:34,960
你死了吗？
Are you dead?

881
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,850
不 但我快死了
No, Christine. But I am dying.

882
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:40,930
对
Right.

883
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:43,390
好吧
Yeah. All right.

884
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:45,140
好
Okay.

885
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,400
哇
Oh, wow.

886
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,870
我没见过这种伤口
I've never seen a wound like this.

887
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,820
你被什么刺伤？
What were you stabbed with?

888
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,580
不知道
I don't know.

889
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,100
我必须消失了
I'm gonna have to vanish now.

890
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:23,560
什么？
What?

891
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,180
让我活下去 好吗？
Keep me alive, will you?

892
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,310
好
Okay.

893
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:55,840
惨了
Oh, shit.

894
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,370
充电至200焦耳

895
01:09:33,382 --> 01:09:34,552
Come on, come on.

896
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:40,840
史蒂芬 加油
Stephen, come on.

897
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:44,970
再来一次
Hit me again.

898
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,640
不要这样吓人
Stop doing that!

899
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:48,600
加强电流 再来一次
Up the voltage and hit me again.

900
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:49,730
不 你的心脏在跳了
No, your heart's beating!

901
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:51,140
动手就是了
Just do it!

902
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:53,770
天啊
Oh, my god.

903
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:55,600
选择电流强度：（焦耳）

904
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:00,320
充电至360焦耳

905
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:00,900
请勿碰触病患 按下电击按钮

906
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:24,720
天啊…
Oh, god! Oh, god!

907
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:25,970
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

908
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:27,140
嗯
Yeah.

909
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:28,340
好
Okay.

910
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:36,820
过了这么久
After all this time...

911
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,780
你突然出现在这里
You just show up here...

912
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:42,410
飞出自己的身体
Flying out of your body.

913
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:44,290
我知道
Yeah, I know.

914
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,990
对了 我也很想你
I missed you, too, by the way.

915
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:47,960
哈哈
Ha ha.

916
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:50,660
我写电邮给你 你都没回
I wrote you emails, but you never responded.

917
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:51,990
我干嘛回？
Why would I?

918
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:55,210
克莉丝汀 我真的非常抱歉
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

919
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:58,130
你说的都对
For all of it. You were right.

920
01:10:58,330 --> 01:11:01,930
我是个大猪头 对你真的很坏
I was a complete asshole. I treated you so horribly.

921
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,430
你值得被好好珍惜
And you deserved so much more.

922
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:06,050
住口 你惊吓过度了
Stop. You're clearly in shock.

923
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:10,310
到底发生什么事？
What the hell is happening?

924
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:11,770
你到哪去了？
Where have you been?

925
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,770
西医对我束手无策
After western medicine failed me...

926
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:18,900
我往东方去 最后到了加德满都
I headed east, and I ended up in kathmandu.

927
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:20,190
加德满都？
Kathmandu?

928
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:21,530
对
Yeah.

929
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,700
像巴布席格那首歌？
Like the Bob seger song?

930
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,780
1975年 《美丽失败者》 A面
1975, beautiful loser, side a. Yeah.

931
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:29,660
我到了一个叫卡玛泰姬的地方
I went to a place called kamar-taj...

932
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:33,500
跟一个叫古一的人交谈
And I talked to someone called "the ancient one."

933
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,620
所以你加入邪教
So you joined a cult.

934
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,300
没有 不算是
No, I didn't. No, not exactly. No.

935
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:41,220
他们教我开发我不知道的力量
They did teach me to tap into powers that I never even knew existed.

936
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:42,630
听起来就像邪教
Yeah. That sounds like a cult.

937
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,050
那不是邪教
It's not a cult.

938
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,770
邪教信徒都这么说
That's what a cultist would say.

939
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,800
不
Oh, no.

940
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:49,850
等等 史蒂芬 你想干嘛？
Wait. Stephen, wait. What do you think you're doing?

941
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:51,720
邪教聚会快迟到了
I'm late for a cult meeting.

942
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,610
这实在太扯了
This is insane.

943
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,770
是啊
Yeah.

944
01:11:57,850 --> 01:11:59,850
你要去哪？
Where are you going?

945
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:01,820
你能跟我说实话吗？
Can you tell me the truth?

946
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:06,200
有个信奉某种古老形体的强大法师
A powerful sorcerer who gave himself over to an ancient entity...

947
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,990
他能改变物理法则 千方百计要杀我
Can bend the very laws of physics, tried very hard to kill me.

948
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:10,920
但我把他拴在格林威治村
But I left him chained up in greenwich village...

949
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:13,510
回到那里最快的办法 就是穿过我在清洁工具间
And the quickest way back there is through a dimensional gateway...

950
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:14,680
打开的异次元入口
That I opened up in the mop closet.

951
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,580
好吧 别告诉我
Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.

952
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:28,720
我真的该走了
Really do have to go.

953
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:30,890
喔
Yeah.

954
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,760
史传奇
Strange!

955
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:21,520
你没事
You're okay.

956
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:23,860
相较之下 我算没事
A relative term. But yeah, I'm okay.

957
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,400
魔浮斗篷
The cloak of levitation.

958
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,910
它找上了你
It came to you.

959
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:31,110
这可不容易
No minor feat.

960
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:33,490
它喜怒无常
It's a fickle thing.

961
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,660
他逃走了 卡西流斯？
He's escaped.

962
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:36,950
对
Kaecilius?

963
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:39,750
他能任意摺叠空间和物体
Yeah.

964
01:13:37,876 --> 01:13:40,166
He can fold space and matter at will.

965
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:43,370
他能摺叠镜次元之外的物体
He folds matter outside the mirror dimension...

966
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:44,630
在现实世界里？
In the real world?

967
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:45,830
是
Yeah.

968
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,800
还有几个？ 两个
How many more?

969
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:50,890
我把其中一个困在沙漠里
Two.

970
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:51,142
I stranded one in the desert.

971
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,060
另一个呢？
And the other?

972
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:53,600
他的身体在走廊
His body's in the hall.

973
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:55,470
杜朗大师在门厅
Master drumm is in the foyer.

974
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,350
他被带回卡玛泰姬了
He's been taken back to kamar-taj.

975
01:13:57,430 --> 01:13:59,070
伦敦至圣所沦陷了
The London sanctum has fallen.

976
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,350
现在只剩纽约和香港
Only New York and Hong Kong remain now...

977
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,600
保护我们不沦落到黑暗次元
To shield us from the dark dimension.

978
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:07,240
你让纽约至圣所躲过攻击
You defended the New York sanctum from attack.

979
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,230
如今它的大师出缺 需要再找一个
With its master gone, it needs another.

980
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,900
史传奇大师
Master strange.

981
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:14,780
不
No.

982
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:17,990
我是史传奇医师
It is doctor strange.

983
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:20,790
不是史传奇大师 不是史传奇先生
Not master strange. Not mister strange.

984
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,040
史传奇医师
Doctor strange.

985
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:26,920
我当上医生时曾发誓不伤害人
When I became a doctor, i swore an oath to do no harm.

986
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,340
我却杀了一个人
And I have just killed a man!

987
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:30,260
下不为例
I'm not doing that again.

988
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,810
我当医生是为了救人 不是杀人
I became a doctor to save lives, not take them.

989
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:36,220
你当医生只为了救一个人
You became a doctor to save one life above all others.

990
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,300
你自己
Your own.

991
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:40,560
你还是看穿我了 是吧？
Still seeing through me, are you?

992
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:44,390
我看到的东西没变 你过度膨胀的自我
I see what I've always seen: Your over-inflated ego.

993
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:48,110
你想回到那个以为 你能掌控一切的幻象
You want to go back to the delusion that you can control anything...

994
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:49,610
甚至死亡
Even death...

995
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:51,410
但谁都无法掌控死亡
Which no one can control.

996
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:54,240
连伟大的史传奇医师都没办法
Not even the great doctor Stephen strange.

997
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,580
连多玛暮也不能吗？
Not even dormammu?

998
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,080
他说我们能永生不死
He offers immortality.

999
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,240
多玛暮的生命来自我们怕死
It's our fear of death that gives dormammu life.

1000
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:03,630
他靠那种能量而壮大
He feeds off it.

1001
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:06,050
就像你靠他才壮大？
Like you feed off him?

1002
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,970
你跟我谈掌控死亡？
You talk to me about controlling death?

1003
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,130
我知道你的秘诀
I know how you do it.

1004
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:12,010
我看过卡里欧斯卓之书上 遗失的仪式内容
I've seen the missing rituals from the book of cagliostro.

1005
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:15,920
接下来说话当心点 医生
Measure your next words very carefully, doctor.

1006
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:17,890
因为你不爽听？
Because you might not like them?

1007
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:21,020
因为你根本不懂自己说出口的话
Because you may not know of what you speak.

1008
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:22,760
他在说什么？
What is he talking about?

1009
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:26,230
我在说她这么长寿 永生不老的原因
I'm talking about her long life, the source of her immortality.

1010
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:31,270
她靠汲取黑暗次元的力量存活
She draws power from the dark dimension to stay alive.

1011
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:34,360
并不是
That's not true.

1012
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:36,740
我解析了那些仪式
I've seen the rituals. Worked them out.

1013
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:39,030
我知道你如何办到
I know how you do it.

1014
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:42,160
他们一旦重新整合
Once they regroup...

1015
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:43,910
狂热者就会回来
The zealots will be back.

1016
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,460
你需要外力协助
You'll need reinforcements.

1017
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,430
她不是你所想的那样
She's not who you think she is.

1018
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:57,470
你没有立场这么说
You don't have the right to say that.

1019
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,310
你不知道她肩负着多大责任
You've no idea the responsibility that rests upon her shoulders.

1020
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:02,310
对 我也不想知道
No, and I don't want to know.

1021
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:03,770
你这懦夫
You're a coward.

1022
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:05,190
因为我不是杀人凶手？
Because I'm not a killer?

1023
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:06,950
这些狂热者会杀光我们
These zealots will snuff us all out...

1024
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,610
你不能集中力量先歼灭他们吗？
And you can't muster the strength to snuff them first?

1025
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:11,290
你以为我刚刚做了什么？
What do you think I just did?

1026
01:16:11,310 --> 01:16:12,530
你救了自己一命
You saved your own life!

1027
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:16,450
然后又抱怨个不停
And then whined about it like a wounded dog.

1028
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:18,130
难道你杀人像喝水一样简单？
You would have done it so easily?

1029
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:20,830
你不知道我做过什么
You've no idea the things I've done.

1030
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:24,870
没有错
And the answer is yes.

1031
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:26,670
我杀人不眨眼
Without hesitation.

1032
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:28,030
即使还有其他办法？
Even if there's another way?

1033
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,000
没有其他办法
There is no other way.

1034
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,460
你缺乏想像力
You lack imagination.

1035
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:32,630
不 史蒂芬
No, Stephen.

1036
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:36,340
是你没种
You lack a spine.

1037
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:42,680
他们回来了
They're back.

1038
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:50,780
我们得把他们解决掉
We have to end this.

1039
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:52,070
动手
Now!

1040
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,410
史传奇
Strange!

1041
01:16:58,650 --> 01:17:00,240
下来对抗他们
Get down here and fight!

1042
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:01,660
不！
No!

1043
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,370
镜次元
The mirror dimension.

1044
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:10,370
你在这里无法影响现实世界
You can't affect the real world in here.

1045
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:12,170
现在该笑的是谁？
Who's laughing now?

1046
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:13,500
混蛋
Asshole.

1047
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,420
是我
I am.

1048
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:31,740
我拿到他的灵环了
I've got his sling ring. They can't escape, right?

1049
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:32,770
他们逃不掉了吧？

1050
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:35,280
快跑！
Run!

1051
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,140
他们与黑暗次元的关联
Their connection to the dark dimension

1052
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,090
使他们在镜次元中更强大
makes them more powerful in the mirror dimension.

1053
01:17:56,170 --> 01:17:58,560
他们无法影响现实世界 却还是能杀死我们
They can't affect the real world, but they can still kill us.

1054
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:01,430
这样并不明智 反而是自杀
This wasn't cleverness. It was suicide!

1055
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:20,200
众妙之门

1056
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:20,240
太爆笑了
That is hilarious.

1057
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:08,200
这完全是个错误
This was a mistake.

1058
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:41,790
果然没错
It's true.

1059
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:46,090
她确实从黑暗次元汲取法力
She does draw power from the dark dimension.

1060
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:50,640
卡西流斯
Kaecilius.

1061
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:56,270
我来找你时身心俱疲
I came to you broken...

1062
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,270
彷徨无助
Lost, in need.

1063
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,270
我把你当成导师 你却满口谎言
Trusted you to be my teacher, and you fed me lies.

1064
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:04,240
我是想保护你
I tried to protect you.

1065
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,730
不让我知道真相吗？ 不让你伤害自己
From the truth?

1066
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:09,110
现在我有了新导师
From yourself.

1067
01:21:07,159 --> 01:21:09,449
I have a new teacher now.

1068
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,620
多玛暮骗你
Dormammu deceives you.

1069
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:13,910
你不知道他的真面目
You have no idea what he truly is.

1070
01:21:14,110 --> 01:21:17,960
他的永生不是天堂 而是苦难
His eternal life is not paradise, but torment.

1071
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,340
骗人
Liar.

1072
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:16,180
克莉丝汀
Christine!

1073
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:18,600
开什么玩笑？
Are you kidding me?

1074
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:20,760
天啊
Oh, my god.

1075
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:25,530
不是心房颤动 她心肌顿抑
It's not fibrillation. She has a stunned myocardium.

1076
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:26,800
- 神经引起的？ - 对
-Neurogenic? -Yes.

1077
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:33,030
谁去拿棉花棒
Someone get the swabs.

1078
01:22:35,530 --> 01:22:36,530
尼克
Nic?

1079
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:41,630
我们得降低她的脑压
We need to relieve the pressure on her brain.

1080
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,380
她心跳率继续下降
She's still dropping.

1081
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:47,500
她快不行了
-We're losing her! -We need to increase her oxygen!

1082
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:48,840
增加她的氧气

1083
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,040
我需要急救车
-I need a crash cart! -Her pupils have dilated!

1084
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:51,410
她瞳孔放大

1085
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:52,880
没反射反应
No reflexes. We're not reading any brain activity.

1086
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,440
看不到脑部活动

1087
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,530
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

1088
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,230
别这样 你快死了
Come on, you're dying!

1089
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:21,410
你得立刻回到你的肉体 没时间了
You have to return to your body now. You don't have time.

1090
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:23,210
时间是相对的
Time is relative.

1091
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:25,580
你还不懂
Your body hasn't even hit the floor yet.

1092
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,300
我花了这么多年
I've spent so many years...

1093
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:31,090
窥探未来
Peering through time...

1094
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,750
看着眼前这一刻
Looking at this exact moment.

1095
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,460
但却看不透它
But I can't see past it.

1096
01:23:36,130 --> 01:23:39,680
我避开了无数可怕的未来
I've prevented countless, terrible futures.

1097
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,350
每个未来之后总是有另一个
And after each one, there's always another.

1098
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:44,810
它们全都导向这里
And they all lead here...

1099
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:45,890
却不再往前
But never further.

1100
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:48,110
你认为你的死期到了
You think this is where you die.

1101
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:51,400
想知道我在你的未来看到什么吗？
You wonder what I see in your future?

1102
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:52,610
不想
No.

1103
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:55,990
想
Yes.

1104
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:57,620
我始终没看到你的未来
I never saw your future.

1105
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:00,250
只看到它的可能性
Only its possibilities.

1106
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:03,040
你具有强大的行善能力
You have such a capacity for goodness.

1107
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,120
你一向出类拔萃
You always excelled...

1108
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,710
但不是因为你渴望成功
But not because you craved success...

1109
01:24:07,790 --> 01:24:10,260
而是你害怕失败
But because of your fear of failure.

1110
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:12,080
所以我才成为一个杰出的医生
That's what made me a great doctor.

1111
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:14,890
那正是阻止你更伟大的障碍
It's precisely what kept you from greatness.

1112
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,050
傲慢与恐惧
Arrogance and fear still keep you...

1113
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:19,510
依然让你无法学会
From learning the simplest and most significant lesson of all.

1114
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:21,640
最简单最重要的教训

1115
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:22,720
那是？
Which is?

1116
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:27,190
重点不在你身上
It's not about you.

1117
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:32,280
当你第一次来找我
When you first came to me...

1118
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:35,530
你问我如何治愈强纳森潘柏恩
You asked me how I was able to heal Jonathan pangborn.

1119
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:37,820
我没有
I didn't.

1120
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:43,990
他将次元能量直接注入自己身体
He channels dimensional energy directly into his own body.

1121
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,910
他利用法力让自己走路？
He uses magic to walk?

1122
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:47,170
一直如此
Constantly.

1123
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:49,590
他有选择
He had a choice...

1124
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:52,340
重返自己的生活
To return to his own life...

1125
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:55,210
或是追求比自己更大的目标
Or to serve something greater than himself.

1126
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:57,970
所以我的手可以恢复正常？
So I could have my hands back again?

1127
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:59,470
重拾过去的生活？
My old life?

1128
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:01,380
可以
You could.

1129
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:05,270
那么世界只会变得更悲惨
And the world would be all the lesser for it.

1130
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:10,150
我厌恶从黑暗次元汲取能量
I've hated drawing power from the dark dimension.

1131
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:11,400
但你很清楚
But as you well know...

1132
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,850
有时必须打破陈规
Sometimes one must break the rules...

1133
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:15,740
才能成就更远大的目标
In order to serve the greater good.

1134
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:17,900
莫度可不会这么想
Mordo won't see it that way.

1135
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:20,610
莫度的灵魂严谨而僵化
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable...

1136
01:25:20,690 --> 01:25:22,910
因为年轻时经历太多风雨
Forged by the fires of his youth.

1137
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,910
他需要你的弹性
He needs your flexibility...

1138
01:25:24,990 --> 01:25:27,040
一如你需要他的定力
Just as you need his strength.

1139
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:31,840
你们联手才有可能阻止多玛暮
Only together do you stand a chance of stopping dormammu.

1140
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,550
我还没准备好
I'm not ready.

1141
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:37,050
从来没有人准备好
No one ever is.

1142
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:40,890
我们无法选择时机
We don't get to choose our time.

1143
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:47,230
死亡赋予生命意义
Death is what gives life meaning.

1144
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:50,940
让人知道日子有限
To know your days are numbered.

1145
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:53,060
人生苦短
Your time is short.

1146
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:57,320
你以为过了这么久 我应该准备好了
You'd think after all this time, I'd be ready.

1147
01:25:58,270 --> 01:25:59,990
但看看我
But look at me.

1148
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:03,070
将一个时刻不断延长
Stretching one moment out into a thousand...

1149
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:05,660
就为了赏雪
Just so that I can watch the snow.

1150
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,830
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

1151
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:55,750
我不懂到底是怎么一回事
I don't understand what's happening.

1152
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:57,010
我知道
I know.

1153
01:26:57,790 --> 01:27:00,670
但我现在必须离开
But I have to go away now.

1154
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:08,470
你说失去双手不是世界末日
You said that losing my hands didn't have to be the end.

1155
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:10,230
反而可能是开始
That it could be a beginning.

1156
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:11,480
是啊
Yeah.

1157
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:15,690
因为还有其他方式可以救人
Because there are other ways to save lives.

1158
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:20,310
更困难的方式
A harder way.

1159
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,820
更奇怪的方式
A weirder way.

1160
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:28,530
帕默医师请到急诊室…
Doctor Palmer to the er, please. Doctor Palmer to the er.

1161
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:34,670
我不要你走
I don't want you to go.

1162
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:23,920
别闹了
Stop!

1163
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:32,640
香港

1164
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:55,830
好好挑选武器
Choose your weapon wisely.

1165
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,340
谁都别想进入这间至圣所
No one steps foot in this sanctum.

1166
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:04,630
谁都不准
No one.

1167
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:21,780
卡西流斯
Kaecilius.

1168
01:29:22,270 --> 01:29:24,440
你站在历史错误的一边 王
You're on the wrong side of history, wong.

1169
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,660
她死了
She's dead.

1170
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:39,960
你说得对
You were right.

1171
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,210
她跟我想的不一样
She wasn't who I thought she was.

1172
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:46,130
她很复杂
She was complicated.

1173
01:29:50,710 --> 01:29:52,140
复杂？
Complicated?

1174
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:57,770
黑暗次元变化无常
The dark dimension is volatile.

1175
01:29:57,970 --> 01:29:59,140
危险
Dangerous.

1176
01:29:59,930 --> 01:30:01,180
要是它制伏了她呢？
What if it overtook her?

1177
01:30:03,230 --> 01:30:05,450
她教我们那是禁忌
She taught us it was forbidden...

1178
01:30:06,350 --> 01:30:10,230
自己却汲取它的能量 多活了几百年
While she drew on its power to steal centuries of life.

1179
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,160
她只是在做她认为正确的事
She did what she thought was right.

1180
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,950
不是不报 时候未到
The bill comes due.

1181
01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:16,290
你还不明白吗？
Don't you see?

1182
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:21,250
她的过错导致狂热者效忠多玛暮
Her transgressions led the zealots to dormammu.

1183
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:24,800
卡西流斯就是她的错
Kaecilius was her fault!

1184
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:26,710
如今我们…
And here we are...

1185
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:29,040
却得面对她欺骗世人的后果
In the consequence of her deception.

1186
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:33,760
一个陷入混乱的世界
A world on fire.

1187
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:36,310
莫度 伦敦至圣所已沦陷
Mordo, the London sanctum has fallen.

1188
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:38,260
纽约两度遭受攻击
The New York one has been attacked twice.

1189
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:39,940
你知道他们接下来的目标
You know where they're going next.

1190
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:41,480
香港
Hong Kong.

1191
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,880
你说过要拚命去对抗
You told me once to fight like my life depended on it...

1192
01:30:43,930 --> 01:30:44,970
因为有一天可能非生即死
Because one day, it might.

1193
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:46,690
那就是今天
Well, today is that day.

1194
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:49,900
我无法独力击败他们
I cannot defeat them alone.

1195
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:08,710
至圣所已经沦陷了
The sanctum's already fallen.

1196
01:31:16,590 --> 01:31:18,510
黑暗次元
The dark dimension.

1197
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:21,770
多玛暮来了
Dormammu is coming.

1198
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:25,400
太迟了
It's too late.

1199
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:27,190
什么都无法阻止他
Nothing can stop him.

1200
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:30,820
不见得
Not necessarily.

1201
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:36,240
不
No.

1202
01:32:17,610 --> 01:32:18,910
走吧
The spell's working.

1203
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:22,660
我们还有第二次机会
We've got a second chance.

1204
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:03,270
不
No!

1205
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:14,900
王
Wong.

1206
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:24,950
破坏自然法则 我了
Breaking the laws of nature. I know.

1207
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,620
现在不能停
Well, don't stop now.

1208
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:31,720
至圣所复原后
When the sanctum's restored, they'll attack it again.

1209
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:32,920
他们会再攻击
We've got to defend it.

1210
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,170
我们必须守护它

1211
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:35,670
快点
Come on!

1212
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:04,940
起来 史传奇
Get up, strange.

1213
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:06,450
起来反抗
Get up and fight.

1214
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:08,320
我们能打完这场仗
We can finish this.

1215
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:11,630
你们反抗不了必然的结果
You can't fight the inevitable.

1216
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:16,790
是不是很美？
Isn't it beautiful?

1217
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:20,710
一个超越时间的世界
A world beyond time.

1218
01:35:23,210 --> 01:35:24,640
超越死亡
Beyond death.

1219
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,300
超越时间 史传奇
Beyond time...

1220
01:35:30,939 --> 01:35:31,559
Strange.

1221
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:05,510
他走了
He's gone.

1222
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:10,180
就连史传奇都弃你而去 屈服在他的力量之下
Even strange has left you and surrendered to his power.

1223
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:45,390
多玛暮 我是来找你商量的
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1224
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:47,880
你是来送死的
You've come to die.

1225
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:52,310
你的世界现在是我的世界
Your world is now my world...

1226
01:36:52,590 --> 01:36:55,060
就像其他的世界一样
Like all worlds.

1227
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:28,340
多玛暮 我是来找你商量的
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1228
01:37:28,670 --> 01:37:31,350
你是来送死的
You've come to die.

1229
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:34,430
你的世界现在是我的…
Your world is now my...

1230
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,100
这是怎么搞的？
What is this?

1231
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,110
幻觉？
Illusion?

1232
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:40,610
不 这是真的
No. This is real.

1233
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:42,190
很好
Good.

1234
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:55,490
多玛暮 我是来找你商量的
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1235
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:58,990
你…怎么回事？
You've... what is happening?

1236
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:02,380
就像你把你次元的法力 给了卡西流斯
Just as you gave kaecilius powers from your dimension...

1237
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:04,960
我也从我的次元带来一点法力
I brought a little power from mine.

1238
01:38:05,330 --> 01:38:07,460
这是时间
This is time.

1239
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:11,090
无限循环的时间
Endless looped time.

1240
01:38:11,630 --> 01:38:13,550
你敢！
You dare!

1241
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:19,650
多玛暮 我是来找你商量的
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1242
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:22,930
你不能永远来这套
You cannot do this forever.

1243
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:24,650
其实我可以
Actually, I can.

1244
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:27,280
现在情况就是如此
This is how things are now.

1245
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,480
你和我困在这一刻里
You and me, trapped in this moment...

1246
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:31,660
无止尽
Endlessly.

1247
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:35,490
那么你会不断死亡
Then you will spend eternity dying.

1248
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:39,790
对 但地球上的人都能活命
Yes. But everyone on earth will live.

1249
01:38:39,950 --> 01:38:41,540
但你会受苦
But you will suffer.

1250
01:38:41,740 --> 01:38:43,670
痛苦是我的老朋友
Pain's an old friend.

1251
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:47,670
多玛暮
Dormammu...

1252
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,010
我是来找你商量的
I've come to bargain.

1253
01:38:49,170 --> 01:38:50,170
赶快停止
End this!

1254
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:53,050
多玛暮… 多玛暮
Dormammu... dormammu...

1255
01:38:52,558 --> 01:38:53,308
Dormammu...

1256

我是来找你商量的
I've come to bargain.

是不是很美？
Isn't it beautiful?

1280
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:22,100
超越死亡
Beyond death.

1281
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:35,280
你做了什么？
What have you done?

1282
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:36,990
我跟他打了个商量
I made a bargain.

1283

你不会喜欢的
You're not gonna like it.

1287
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:16,740
你真该偷走整本书才对
Yeah, you know, you really should have stolen

1288
01:41:14,408 --> 01:41:16,868
the whole book because the warnings...

1289
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:19,070
因为警语在咒语后面
The warnings come after the spells.

1290
01:41:28,740 --> 01:41:30,170
真搞笑
That's funny.

1291

01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:05,540
我们成功了

同时也违反了…

1295
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:09,700
自然法则
The natural law.

1296
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:13,210
看看你四周 结束了
Look around you. It's over.

1297
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:16,180
你还以为不会有后果吗？
You still think there will be no consequences, strange?

1298
01:42:17,630 --> 01:42:19,300
不必付出代价？
No price to pay?

1299
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:22,880
我们破坏了规则 跟她一样
We broke our rules, just like her.

1300
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:27,350
不是不报 时候未到
The bill comes due.

1301
01:42:28,050 --> 01:42:29,150
绝无例外
Always!

1302
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:31,560
迟早都要还
A reckoning.

1303
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:37,490
我不愿再走这条路
I will follow this path no longer.

1304
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:12,860
好
Yeah, okay.

1305

明智的抉择
Wise choice.

1306
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:26,370
你会戴上阿迦莫多之眼
You'll wear the eye of agamotto...

1307
01:43:26,450 --> 01:43:28,700
当你能完全掌握它的力量

1308
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:29,950
在那之前
Until then...

1309
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:33,700
最好不要戴着无限宝石逛大街

1310

A what?

1311
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:38,300
就算你有秘术的天赋
You might have a gift for the mystic arts,

1312
01:43:38,370 --> 01:43:40,220
但要学的还多着呢
but you still have much to learn.

1313
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:45,340
古一的死讯将传遍多重宇宙
Word of the ancient one's death will spread through the multiverse.

1314
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:47,970
没有至尊魔法师能扞卫地球
Earth has no sorcerer supreme to defend it.

1315
01:43:48,470 --> 01:43:49,470

We must be ready.
