322
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,410
17年来都没人能拿到那面旗子
Nobody's got that flag in 17 years!

323
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,850
好了  恢复列队  快点  归队
Now fall back into line! Come on, fall in!

324
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,290
快点  排好队
Let's go! Get back into formation!

325
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,680
罗杰斯
Rogers!

326
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,460
我说归队
I said fall in!

327
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,230
谢了  长官
Thank you, sir.

328
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,210
快点  姑娘们
Faster, ladies! Come on.

329
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,830
我奶奶都比你们有精神  愿她安息
My grandmother has more life in her, God rest her soul.

330
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:55,780
动起来
Move it!

331
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,000
你不是真想选罗杰斯吧
You're not really thinking about picking Rogers, are you?

332
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,940
不止是想
I'm more than just thinking about it.

333
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,120
他是不二之选
He is the clear choice.

334
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,610
你把个90磅的哮喘病猫
When you brought a 90-pound asthmatic

335
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,540
带进我的基地时
onto my army base,

336
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,000
我没反对  我想管他呢
I let it slide. I thought, "What the hell."

337
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,950
也许你是把他当做小白鼠
Maybe he'd be useful to you, like a gerbil.

338
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,650
-我没想过你会选他  -起来
- I never thought you'd pick him. - Up.

339
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,860
这孩子的胳膊
You stick a needle in that kid's arm,

340
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,890
一根针就能扎穿
it's gonna go right through him.

341
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,200
快点  姑娘们
Come on, girls.

342
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,420
看看他
Look at that.

343
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,870
我看着他都快哭了
He's making me cry.

344
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,690
我需要的素质不是体能上的
I am looking for qualities beyond the physical.

345
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,080
你知道我们为这项目付出多少心血吗
Do you know how long it took to set up this project?

346
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,360
我还不得不对那个
All the groveling I had to do

347
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,830
什么参议员的委员会低声下气
in front of Senator What's-His-Name's committees?

348
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,950
是的  我清楚你付出了多少努力
Brandt. Yes, I know. I am well aware of your efforts.

349
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,150
那就给我点回报
Then throw me a bone.

350
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,400
霍奇通过了所有测试
Hodge passed every test we gave him.

351
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,740
他强壮  动作又快
He's big, he's fast.

352
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,220
他遵守命令  是个士兵
He obeys orders. He's a soldier.

353
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,240
他是个恶霸
He is a bully.

354
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,810
靠善良可打不了胜仗  博士
You don't win wars with niceness, Doctor.

355
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,930
打胜仗  靠的是胆量
You win wars with guts.

356
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,150
有手榴弹
Grenade!

357
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:54,880
快跑
Get away!

358
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,710
别过来
Get back!

359
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,760
是假手榴弹
It was a dummy grenade.

360
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,430
警报解除  归队
All clear. Back in formation.

361
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,450
这是测试吗
Is this a test?

362
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,320
他还是太瘦弱了
He's still skinny.

363
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,190
-我能进来吗  -当然
- May I? - Yeah.

364
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,840
睡不着吗
Can't sleep?

365
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,380
可能是紧张吧
I got the jitters, I guess.

366
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,110
我也是
Me, too.

367
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,680
我能问个问题吗
Can I ask you a question?

368
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,910
就一个吗
Just one?

369
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,570
为什么选我
Why me?

370
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,530
这的确是唯一重要的问题
I suppose that is the only question that matters.

371
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,470
这个产自奥格斯堡[德国城市]
This is from Augsburg.

372
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,920
我的故乡
My city.

373
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,620
很多人都忘了
So many people forget that

374
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,530
纳粹第一个侵略的就是自己的国家
the first country the Nazis invaded was their own.

375
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,450
一战结束后
You know, after the last war,

376
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,830
我的同胞们生活得非常艰苦
my people struggled.

377
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,590
他们感到无能为力
They felt weak. They felt

378
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,430
渺小  然后希特勒出现了
small. And then Hitler comes along

379
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:14,550
阅兵  集会  党旗  大肆宣扬煽动
with the marching and the big show and the flags.

380
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,320
他听说了我
And he hears of me.

381
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,880
还有我的工作  他找到了我
My work. And he finds me.

382
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,000
他说  你
And he says, "You."

383
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,510
你要让我们变强
He says, "You will make us strong."

384
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,880
我并不感兴趣
Well, I am not interested.

385
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,460
于是他派来了他的研究部门
So he sends the head of Hydra,

386
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,520
九头蛇的主管
his research division.

387
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,580
那是位天才科学家  叫约翰・施密特
A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt.

388
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,130
施密特已经是核心成员了
Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle.

389
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,850
他野心勃勃
And he is ambitious.

390
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,270
他和希特勒一样痴迷于
He and Hitler share a passion for

391
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,300
超能力和日耳曼神话
occult power and Teutonic myth.

392
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,960
希特勒用他的幻想煽动他的追随者
Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers.

393
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,210
而对施密特来说那不是幻想
But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy.

394
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,170
对他来说  那是真的
For him, it is real.

395
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,400
他相信
He has become convinced

396
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,120
这世上隐藏着一股强大的力量
that there is a great power hidden in the earth,

397
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,420
是众神留下的
left here by the gods,

398
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,320
有待一个更优越的人去发现
waiting to be seized by a superior man.

399
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,610
所以当他得知我血清配方的能耐
So when he hears about my formula and what it can do,

400
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,900
他无法抗拒
he cannot resist.

401
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,830
施密特决心成为那个优越者
Schmidt must become that superior man.

402
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,370
他变强了吗
Did it make him stronger?

403
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,320
是的
Yes.

404
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:26,390
不过也有副作用
But there were other effects.

405
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,920
血清当时尚未调整好
The serum was not ready.

406
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,210
但更重要的是
But more important,

407
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,820
使用的人
the man.

408
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,780
血清能增强人的各个方面  所以
The serum amplifies everything that is inside, so

409
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,200
好的变得更好
good becomes great.

410
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,590
坏的则变得更坏
Bad becomes worse.

411
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,010
所以我选择了你
This is why you were chosen.

412
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:55,790
因为力量与生俱来的强者
Because a strong man who has known power all his life

413
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,630
可能会失去对力量的敬畏
may lose respect for that power,

414
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,220
但弱者
but a weak man

415
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,520
才懂得力量的价值
knows the value of strength.

416
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,040
并且有
And knows

417
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,900
同情心
compassion.

418
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,720
谢谢...吧
Thanks. I think.

419
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,500
拿来
Give this.

420
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,570
不管明天发生什么  答应我一件事
Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing.

421
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,850
永远保持真我
That you will stay who you are.

422
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,400
不是一个好兵
Not a perfect soldier,

423
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,000
而是
but

424
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,210
一个好人
a good man.

425
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,890
敬小个子们
To the little guys.

426
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,400
慢着  我这是干什么
No, no. Wait, wait. What I am doing?

427
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,060
不行  你明天要做手术
No, you have procedure tomorrow.

428
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,110
不能喝酒
No fluids.

429
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,450
好吧  那我们之后再喝
All right. We'll drink it after.

430
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,690
不  我明天又不用做手术
No, I don't have procedure tomorrow.

431
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,210
我不用等  我现在就喝
Drink it after? I drink it now.

432
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,720
你有什么特别需要吗
Is there something in particular you need?

433
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,480
我听说你找到他了
I understand you found him.

434
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,690
你自己看吧
See for yourself.

435
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,130
你不赞成吗
You disapprove.

436
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,150
我只是不明白你为什么要在意他
I just don't see why you need concern yourself.

437
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,460
他不可能成功
I can't imagine he will succeed.

438
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,020
再次成功
Again.

439
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,840
血清是同盟国最后的防线
His serum is the Allies' only defense

440
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,590
能抗衡我们如今掌握的力量
against this power we now possess.

441
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,940
若是我们将其摧毁  就能确保胜利
If we take it away from them, then our victory is assured.

442
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,020
那要我下令吗
Shall I give the order?

443
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,930
我已经下令了
It has been given.

444
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,450
很好
Good.

445
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,020
佐拉博士
Dr. Zola!

446
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,910
你觉得怎样
What do you think?

447
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,340
真是杰作
A masterpiece.

448
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,650
这个街区我很熟悉
I know this neighborhood.

449
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,200
我在那条巷子里被打过
I got beat up in that alley.

450
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,880
还有那个停车场
And that parking lot.

451
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,120
还有那个餐厅后面
And behind that diner.

452
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,070
你是不赞同逃跑吗
Did you have something against running away?

453
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,300
你要是跑了一次  就会一直跑下去
You start running, they'll never let you stop.

454
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,660
而你要是站起来反击
You stand up, you push back.

455
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,980
总有一天会有机会的吧
They can't say no forever, right?

456
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,850
这我略有体会
I know a little of what that's like,

457
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,910
总是被拒绝的感觉
to have every door shut in your face.

458
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,530
我不能理解你为什么要参军
I guess I just don't know why you'd want to join the Army

459
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,310
你是位漂亮的姑娘
if you were a beautiful dame.

460
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,070
我是说漂亮的女人
Or a beautiful... A woman.

461
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,760
是特工  不是姑娘
An agent. Not a dame.

462
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,040
你是很漂亮  但是
You are beautiful, but...

463
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,510
你完全不知道该怎么跟女人搭讪  是吧
You have no idea how to talk to a woman, do you?

464
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,350
这大概是我和女人的最长一次对话了
I think this is the longest conversation I've had with one.

465
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,320
她们不怎么愿意
Women aren't exactly lining up

466
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,420
和一个比她们矮一头的男人跳舞
to dance with a guy they might step on.

467
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,560
你肯定跳过舞吧
You must have danced.

468
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,190
我一直不敢邀女人跳舞
Well, asking a woman to dance always seemed so terrifying.

469
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,490
而这几年来
And the past few years, it just

470
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,070
这事似乎也没那么重要了
didn't seem to matter that much.

471
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,210
我就想不如等等
I figured I'd wait.

472
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,820
等什么
For what?

473
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,720
合适的舞伴
The right partner.

474
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,400
这边走
This way.

475
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,300
我们来这儿干什么
What are we doing here?

476
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,110
跟我来
Follow me.

477
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,460
{\an8}布鲁克林古董店

478
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:14,740
今早的天气很棒吧
Wonderful weather this morning, isn't it?

479
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,110
是啊  但我总带着伞
Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.

480
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,480
早上好
Good morning.

481
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,000
拜托  别拍
Please, not now.

482
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,860
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

483
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,010
很好
Good.

484
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,650
脱掉衬衣和领带  摘掉帽子
Take off your shirt, your tie, and your hat.

485
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,990
布兰德参议员  很高兴你能来
Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.

486
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,610
我到底来这儿干什么来了
Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?

487
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,440
我们需要使用城市电网
We needed access to the city's power grid.

488
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,770
当然  如果你肯把我申请的发电机批下来
Of course, if you'd given me the generators I requisitioned...

489
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:46,340
很多人都在申请经费  上校
A lot of people are asking for funds, Colonel.

490
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,620
这位是克雷...
This is Clem...

491
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,420
弗莱德・克雷姆森  国务院的
Fred Clemson, State Department.

492
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,820
如果你们的项目获得成功
If this project of yours comes through,

493
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,730
我们希望它不仅仅成为轰动新闻
we'd like to see it used for something other than headlines.

494
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,730
老天爷
Jesus.

495
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,090
给那孩子吃点东西吧
Somebody get that kid a sandwich.

496
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,570
舒服吗
Comfortable?

497
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,880
有点大
It's a little big.

498
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,840
那酒有没有给我留
You save me any of that schnapps?

499
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,480
没留多少
Not as much as I should have.

500
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,970
不好意思  下次吧
Sorry. Next time.

501
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,400
斯塔克先生
Mr. Stark,

502
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,460
电力水平如何
how are your levels?

503
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,870
-100%  -很好
- Levels at 100%. - Good.

504
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,320
我们可能会用掉布鲁克林一半电力
We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn,

505
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,610
但我们准备好了
but we are ready

506
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,730
不能更好了
as we'll ever be.

507
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,180
卡特特工
Agent Carter?

508
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,610
你去控制室里会不会更好点
Don't you think you would be more comfortable in the booth?

509
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,520
-好的  抱歉  -好
- Yes, of course. Sorry. - Good.

510
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,810
能听到吗  这开了吗
Do you hear me? Is this on?

511
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,280
女士们  先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

512
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:02,190
今天我们不是进一步走向灭绝
today we take not another step towards annihilation,

513
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:05,980
而是在和平之路上迈出了第一步
but the first step on the path to peace.

514
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,540
首先是一系列微创注射
We begin with a series of microinjections

515
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,690
将血清注入肌肉群
into the subject's major muscle groups.

516
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:18,280
血清注入后会立刻引发细胞改变
The serum infusion will cause immediate cellular change.

517
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,590
之后会刺激生长
And then, to stimulate growth,

518
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:24,160
接着实验对象会接受
the subject will be saturated

519
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,640
生命射线辐射
with Vita-Rays.

520
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,510
感觉还行
That wasn't so bad.

521
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,520
那只是盘尼西林
That was penicillin.

522
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,070
注射血清
Serum infusion

523
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,480
倒计时五秒

开始吧  斯塔克先生
Now, Mr. Stark.

史蒂文
Steven?

530
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,480
能听到我说话吗
Can you hear me?

531
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,580
现在想去厕所是不是有点晚了
It's probably too late to go to the bathroom, right?

532
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,800
继续
We will proceed.

533
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,120
10%
That's 10%.

534
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,170
20%
Twenty percent.

535
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,290
30%
Thirty.

536
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,530
40%
That's 40%.

537
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,130
生命体征正常
Vital signs are normal.

538
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,380
50%
That's 50%.

539

70%
Seventy.

541
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,210
史蒂文
Steven!

542
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:14,640
史蒂文
Steven!

543
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,440
-快关掉  -史蒂文
- Shut it down! - Steven!

544
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,520
快关掉
Shut it down!

545
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,370
关闭反应堆  斯塔克先生
Kill the reactor, Mr. Stark!

546
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,070
关掉  关闭反应堆
Turn it off! Kill it! Kill the reactor!

547
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,060
不
No!

548
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,620
别关
Don't!

549
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,480
我扛得住
I can do this!

550
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,960
80%  90%
Eighty. Ninety.

551
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,240
100%了
That's 100%.

552
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,170
斯塔克先生
Mr. Stark?

553
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,090
史蒂文
Steven.

554
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,050
这小子还真成功了
The son of a bitch did it.

555
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,440
-我做到了  -是的
- I did it. - Yeah, yeah.

556
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,570
我们成功了
I think we did it.

557
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,940
你真的成功了
You actually did it.

558
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,910
感觉怎样
How do you feel?

559
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,150
长高了
Taller.

560
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,880
看起来是高了
You look taller.

561
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,430
现在喜欢布鲁克林了吗  参议员
How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?

562
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,720
这下柏林的那帮家伙要紧张了
I can think of some folks in Berlin who are about to get very nervous.

563
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,540
祝贺你  博士
Congratulations, Doctor.

564
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,920
谢谢  先生

565
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:09,840
拦住他
Stop him!

566
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,130
-他们来了  闪开  -快
- They're coming, move it! - Go.

567
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,060
怎么回事  哥们  你没事吧
What are you doing? Buddy, are you all right?

568
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,000
这人中枪了
Hey, this guy's been shot!

569
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,200
我都瞄准他了
I had him!

570
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,580
抱歉

571
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,170
抱歉
I'm sorry!

572

00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,020
住手
Stop it!

574
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,220
别伤害他
Don't hurt him!

575
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,150
别过来
Get back!

576
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,560
放开我
Let me go!

577
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,450
等等  不要

别伤害他
Don't hurt him!

579
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,370
等等  不要
Wait, don't! Don't!

580
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,320
不要
No! Don't!

581
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,180
去抓他  我会游泳
Go get him! I can swim!

582
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,670
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

583
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,090
先头兵
The first of many.

584
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,460
砍掉一颗头
Cut off one head,

585
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,100
会再长出两个
two more shall take its place.

586
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,520
九头蛇万岁
Hail Hydra.

587
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:10,000
元首可不习惯被无视  施密特先生
The Führer is not accustomed to being ignored, Herr Schmidt.

588
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,800
你承诺为他提供武器  他才资助你的研究
He funds your research because you promised him weapons.

589
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,820
你得听从他的命令
You serve at his pleasure.

590
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,800
因为你负伤  他才将这个研究所奖励给你
He gave you this facility as a reward for your injuries.

591
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:20,410
奖励  实话实说吧  这是流放
Reward? Call it what it is. Exile.

592
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,320
我不再符合他心目中雅利安人的完美形象
I no longer reflect his image of Aryan perfection.

593
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,380
你觉得这只是外表的问题吗
You think this is about appearances?

594
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,460
你的九头蛇部门未能
Your Hydra division has failed

595
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,240
在超过一年的时间里拿出哪怕一杆来复枪
to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year.

596
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,540
而且我们从当地情报部门获知
And we had learned through local intelligence

597
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,930
你们还向挪威发起了全面入侵
you had mounted a full-scale incursion into Norway.

598
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,930
元首认为  他怎么说的来着
The Führer feels... How does he put it?

599
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,830
不能再继续放纵红骷髅了
"The Red Skull has been indulged long enough!"

600
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,380
先生们
Gentlemen,

601
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,660
你们是来看我们的研究成果的
you have come to see the results of our work.

602
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,320
我给你们展示一下
Let me show you.

603
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,790
希特勒说要让德意志帝国千秋万代
Hitler speaks of a 1,000-year Reich,

604
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:09,710
事实上却拿不出军队一个月的给养
but he cannot feed his armies for a month.

605
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:13,270
他的部队在欧洲战场上流血牺牲
His troops spill their blood across every field in Europe,

606
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:17,780
可他的目标却还是遥遥无期
but still he is no closer to achieving his goals.

607
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,480
这么说你仍想用魔法来打赢战争
And I suppose you still aim to win this war through magic?

608
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:25,880
是科学  但我理解你的困惑
Science. But I understand your confusion.

609
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,010
强大的力量向来令愚昧之人感到迷茫
Great power has always baffled primitive men.

610
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:31,100
九头蛇正在建立军火库
Hydra is assembling an arsenal

611
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,290
能将我的敌人一网打尽
to destroy my enemies in one stroke,

612
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:36,560
不管他们是谁  拥有多少兵力
wherever they are, regardless of how many forces they possess,

613
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,310
只需几个小时就能铲灭
all in a matter of hours.

614
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:39,520
你的敌人吗
Your enemies?

615
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,280
我的武器具有足够强的破坏力
My weapons contain enough destructive power

616
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,480
能摧毁世界上所有敌国的首都
to decimate every hostile capital on Earth.

617
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:49,030
简单说  先生们
Quite simply, gentlemen,

618
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,610
我已获得了诸神的力量
I have harnessed the power of the gods.

619
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,790
谢谢  施密特
Thank you, Schmidt.

620
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:57,210
谢什么
For what?

621
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:00,530
让我们明白你有多疯狂
For making it clear how obviously mad you are.

622
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:02,130
柏林也在地图上
Berlin is on this map!

623
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,770
当然了
So it is.

624
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:08,940
你要为你的傲慢付出代价
You will be punished for your insolence!

625
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,960
你要被带到元首面前...
You will be brought before the Führer himself!

626
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:23,100
施密特
Schmidt...

627
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,860
抱歉了  博士
My apologies, Doctor,

628
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,180
但我们都知道
but we both knew

629
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:34,900
在希特勒的阴影下  九头蛇无法壮大
Hydra could grow no further in Hitler's shadow.

630
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,600
九头蛇万岁
Hail Hydra.

631
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,550
九头蛇万岁
Hail Hydra!

632
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:45,690
九头蛇万岁
Hail Hydra!

633
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:58,830
抽够了吗
Think you got enough?

634
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:02,720
重新制造血清的方法
Any hope of reproducing the program

635
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,810
就在你的基因序列里

655
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:50,440
九头蛇其实是个邪教组织
Hydra is practically a cult.

656
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:52,640
他们把施密特奉为神  认为他无所不能

671
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,090
不是我对上校有意见
With all due respect to the Colonel,

672
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,270
我觉得我们没看到重点
I think we may be missing the point.

673
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,360

I finally got everything I wanted

789
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:09,460
却是穿着紧身衣
and I'm wearing tights.

790
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,060
他们好像刚打了一场恶仗
They look like they've been through hell.

791
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,540
这些士兵最惨
These men more than most.

792
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:27,920
施密特向阿扎诺派出了一支部队
Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano.

793
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:30,440
两百名士兵前去迎战
Two hundred men went up against him,

794
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,750
回来的不到五十个
and less than 50 returned.

795
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,190
你的观众里就有剩下的107步兵团的人
Your audience contained what was left of the 107th.

796
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:39,300
其他人的不是被杀就是被俘
The rest were killed or captured.

797
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,500
107步兵团
The 107th?

798
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,270
怎么了
What?

799
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,430
快走
Come on.

800
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:45,400
菲利普斯上校
Colonel Phillips.

801
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,680
这不是胸前闪耀美国星  运筹帷幄的人吗
Well, if it isn't the Star-Spangled Man With A Plan.

802
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,930
你今天运筹什么了
What's your plan today?

803
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:50,390
我要阿扎诺战役的伤亡名单
I need the casualty list from Azzano.

804
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:51,990
你没资格命令我  小子
You don't get to give me orders, son.

805
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,090
我只想知道有没有
I just need one name,

806
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:55,390
107步兵团的詹姆斯・巴恩斯中士
Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.

807
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,250
我待会儿再找你算账
You and I are gonna have a conversation later that you won't enjoy.

808
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:00,030
拜托告诉我他还活着  长官  BAR
Please tell me if he's alive, sir. B-A-R...

809
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:01,190
我知道怎么拼
I can spell.

810
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,780
我今天签了很多哀悼信
I have signed more of these condolence letters today

811
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,440
有多少我都记不清了
than I would care to count.

812
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,010
但是  这个名字我有印象
But the name does sound familiar.

813
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:16,100
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

814
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,590
那其他人呢
What about the others?

815
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:22,990
你们准备去营救吗
Are you planning a rescue mission?

816
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:24,660
必须以大局为重
Yes, it's called "Winning the war."

817
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:26,970
但既然你知道他们在哪  为什么...
But if you know where they are, why not at least...

818
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:29,130
他们在敌阵后方30英里
They're 30 miles behind the lines

819
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:32,020
得穿过全欧洲戒备最森严的地区
through some of the most heavily fortified territory in Europe.

820
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:33,360
去营救只会损失更多人
We'd lose more men than we'd save.

821
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,090
我不指望你能理解这些
But I don't expect you to understand that

822
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:36,910
因为你只是个演节目的
because you're a chorus girl.

823
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:40,540
我想我能理解
I think I understand just fine.

824
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:42,200
那去其他地方理解吧
Well, then understand it somewhere else.

825
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,430
如果我没看错海报的话
If I read the posters correctly,

826
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:45,450
你得在30分钟内赶到其他地方
you got someplace to be in 30 minutes.

827
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,560
是  长官
Yes, sir.

828
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,290
没错
I do.

829
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,270
如果你有什么想说
If you have something to say,

830
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:01,840
现在最好别说
right now is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.

831
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,660
你想怎么办  走去奥地利吗
What do you plan to do, walk to Austria?

832
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:09,820
如果必须如此的话
If that's what it takes.

833
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,480
你听到上校说的了  你朋友可能已经死了
You heard the Colonel. Your friend is most likely dead.

834
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,150
但不能确定
You don't know that.

835
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:15,430
即便如此  他在制定计划  如果他...
Even so, he's devising a strategy. If he detects...

836
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,940
等他计划好了  可能就晚了
By the time he's done that, it could be too late.

837
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:19,470
史蒂夫
Steve!

838
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,850
你说你觉得我本该能做更多事
You told me you thought I was meant for more than this.

839
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,970
你是真心的吗
Did you mean that?

840
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:32,720
当然
Every word.

841
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:36,020
那就让我去
Then you got to let me go.

842
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:40,440
我还能做更多
I can do more than that.

843
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,270
上台了  姑娘们  5分钟
On stage, girls. Five minutes!

844
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:47,160
我的头盔呢
Where's my helmet?

845
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,830
有人看到罗杰斯了吗
Anyone seen Rogers?

846
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:54,820
九头蛇军营在克劳斯堡
The Hydra camp is in Krausberg,

847
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,570
在这两座山脉之间
tucked between these two mountain ranges.

848
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:57,800
是一个工厂
It's a factory of some kind.

849
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,190
我们应该能把你送到门口
We should be able to drop you right on the doorstep.

850
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,820
尽可能地接近目标
Just get me as close as you can.

851
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,890
你们着陆后会面临大麻烦的
You two are gonna be in a lot of trouble when you land.

852
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,400
-你不也是  -我要去的地方
- And you won't? - Where I'm going,

853
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,370
可以直接对冲我吼的人开枪
if anybody yells at me, i can just shoot them.

854
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:09,550
他们也会开枪打你的
They will undoubtedly shoot back.

855
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:11,360
那就希望这玩意有点用吧
Well, let's hope it's good for something.

856
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,540
卡特特工
Agent Carter?

857
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:13,520
如果我们不是赶时间
If we're not in too much of a hurry,

858
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,180
真该去趟卢塞恩一起吃芝士火锅宵夜
I thought we could stop off in Lucerne for a late-night fondue.

859
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:25,540
斯塔克是我见过最好的平民飞行员
Stark is the best civilian pilot I've ever seen.

860
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,480
只有他敢飞进这里  有他在是我们走运
He's mad enough to brave this airspace. We're lucky to have him.

861
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:31,920
那么你们俩  真要去
So, are you two... do you...

862
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:35,250
芝士火锅吗
...fondue?

863
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:38,640
这是应答器  准备好就启动
This is your transponder. Activate it when you're ready

864
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:40,750
我们会根据信号找到你
and the signal will lead us straight to you.

865
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,700
你确定这管用吗
Are you sure this thing works?

866
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,020
它受测试的次数比你还多  伙计
It's been tested more than you, pal.

867
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,980
回来  我们要把你送到门口
Get back here! We're taking you all the way in!

868
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:56,940
我一跳下去
As soon as I'm clear,

869
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,150
你们赶紧掉头离开这鬼地方
you turn this thing around and get the hell out of here!

870
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:01,430
你不能命令我
You can't give me orders!

871
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:02,870
我当然可以
The hell I can't!

872
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:04,020
我是队长[上尉]
I'm a Captain!

873
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,640
正如你所见
As you can see,

874
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,670
瓦尔基里正在按计划建造
production of the Valkyrie is progressing on schedule,

875
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:28,950
即使是这种大小的零件
even with components of this size.

876
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:32,220
将进度提高60%
Increase the output by 60%

877
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:35,990
其他研究所也一样
and see to it our other facilities do the same.

878
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:41,320
但这些囚犯  他们恐怕没这力气
But these prisoners, I'm not sure they have the strength.

879
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,270
那就用尽他们的力气  博士
Then use up what strength they have left, Doctor.

880
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:47,450
工人永远都不会缺
There are always more workers.

881
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:50,790
现在别烦我
Not now!

882
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:07,840
告诉你  德国佬
You know, Fritz,

883
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,670
总有一天  老子也会有根棍子
one of these days, I'm gonna have a stick of my own.

884
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:45,550
两位
Fellas.

885
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:48,960
你是谁
Who are you supposed to be?

886
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,960
美国队长
I'm Captain America.

887
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,130
你说啥
I beg your pardon?

888
01:00:58,410 --> 01:00:59,850
怎么着  所有人都带走吗
What, are we taking everybody?

889
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:02,230
我来自夫勒斯诺  老大
I'm from Fresno, Ace.

890
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:03,370
还有其他人吗
Is there anybody else?

891
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:05,260
我在找詹姆斯・巴恩斯中士
I'm looking for a Sergeant James Barnes.

892
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,690
工厂里有个隔离病房
There's an isolation ward in the factory,

893
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:08,090
被带去的人都没回来
but no one's ever come back from it.

894
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:09,160
好吧
All right.

895
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,940
林木线在西北方  离大门80码
The tree line is northwest, 80 yards past the gate.

896
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:13,570
你们冲出去  给他们点颜色瞧瞧
Get out fast and give 'em hell.

897
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:15,850
我找到其他人后去空地跟你们会合
I'll meet you guys in the clearing with anybody else I find.

898
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:18,110
等等  你知道你在做什么吗
Wait. You know what you're doing?

899
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:21,280
当然  我揍了阿道夫・希特勒两百多次了
Yeah. I've knocked out Adolf Hitler over 200 times.

900
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:47,550
你知道怎么用吗
You know how to use that thing?

901
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,540
好吧
Okay.

902
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:56,520
怎么回事
What is happening?

903
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,890
这可不是别克
Not exactly a Buick.

904
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,670
-这是点火器  -啥
- That one. "Zündung." - Zündung?

905
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:12,340
快启动  杜根
Get this thing going, Dugan!

906
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:13,790
我不知道你还会说德语
I didn't know you spoke German.

907
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:15,020
在霍华德大学上了三学期

908
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:17,060
后来改学了法语  法国妞更俏

909
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,610
又没叫你报简历
Didn't ask for the resume.

910
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,850
-左边  -上去
- On your left! - Up top!

911
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:52,130

No, no! What are you doing?

912
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,200
我们的士兵不是对手
Our forces are outmatched.

913
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,140
继续走

921
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:26,350

I thought you were dead.

922
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:28,360
我还以为你比这矮
I thought you were smaller.

923
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:37,340
走吧
Come on.

924
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,160
你是怎么回事
What happened to you?

925
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,330
我参了军
I joined the Army.

926
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,910
痛吗
Did it hurt?

927
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:50,910
有点
A little.

928
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:54,040
-效果是永久性的吗  -坚持到现在了
- Is this permanent? - So far.

929
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:25,780
美国队长
Captain America!

930
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:27,380
我真激动
How exciting!

931
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:30,940
我可是你的大影迷
I am a great fan of your films!

932
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:36,730
这么说厄斯金博士还是成功了
So, Dr. Erskine managed it after all.

933
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,520
虽然没什么进步  但是
Not exactly an improvement, but still,

934
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:42,470
还是很不错
impressive.

935
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,790
你根本无法想象
You've got no idea.

936
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:50,980
是吗
Haven't I?

937
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:09,870
不管厄斯金怎么骗你的
No matter what lies Erskine told you,

938
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:12,700
我才是他最成功的杰作
you see, I was his greatest success!

939
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,180
你没变成这鬼模样吧
You don't have one of those, do you?

940
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,630
你在自欺欺人  队长
You are deluded, Captain.

941
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,800
你假装自己是个普通士兵
You pretend to be a simple soldier,

942
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,980
但其实  你是不敢承认
but in reality, you are just afraid to admit

943
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:40,200
我们都已经不是人类了
that we have left humanity behind.

944
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:43,440
跟你不同
Unlike you,

945
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,610
我骄傲地接受了这一点
I embrace it proudly.

946
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:47,380
毫不畏惧
Without fear!

947
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:48,930
那你为什么要跑
Then how come you're running?

948
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:02,520
来  我们走  上去
Come on, let's go. Up.

949
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:08,330
长官  我们去楼顶吗
Sir? Are we going to the roof?

950
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:13,400
那我怎么办
What about me?

951
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,870
我要坐哪里
Where will I sit?

952
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:17,460
别划花我的车  博士
Not a scratch, Doctor.

953
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:18,720
记住了
Not a scratch.

954
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:53,670
走  我们一个个过去
Let's go. One at a time.

955
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,310
这儿肯定有绳子
Gotta be a rope or something!

956
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:25,880
走吧  快离开这儿
Just go! Get out of here!

957
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,620
我不会丢下你的
No! Not without you!

958
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:41,380
不管了
Hell.

959
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:54,060
布兰德参议员  很遗憾地告知您
Senator Brandt, I regret to report that

960
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:55,410
史蒂文・G・罗杰斯队长
Captain Steven G. Rogers

961
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:59,300
与3日在敌后区域失踪
went missing behind enemy lines on the third.

962
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:01,320
空中侦察无果
Aerial reconnaissance has proven unfruitful.

963
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:06,330
因此  我只能宣布罗杰斯队长
As a result, I must declare Captain Rogers

964
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:08,580
在行动中阵亡  结束
killed in action. Period.

965
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,170
最后一架侦察机回来了
The last surveillance flight is back.

966
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:18,280
没有活动迹象
No sign of activity.

967
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,020
-去喝杯咖啡吧  下士  -是  长官
- Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal. - Yes, sir.

968
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:27,160
我们不能把斯塔克怎样  他是富豪
I can't touch Stark. He's rich

969
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,300
还是军队最大的武器承包商
and he's the Army's number one weapons contractor.

970
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,220
-而你则都不是  -恕我直言  长官
- You are neither one. - With respect, sir,

971
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:33,020
我不后悔我的行为
I don't regret my actions.

972
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:34,780
我认为罗杰斯队长也不后悔
And I don't think Captain Rogers did, either.

973
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:37,850
你觉得我在意你的想法吗
What makes you think I give a damn about your opinions?

974
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:39,340
我给了你个机会  卡特特工
I took a chance with you, Agent Carter.

975
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:41,010
而现在美国金童
And now America's golden boy

976
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,920
还有很多优秀士兵死了
and a lot of other good men are dead

977
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:44,470
就因为你喜欢人家
'cause you had a crush.

978
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:46,070
不是的
It wasn't that.

979
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:47,420
我是有信念
I had faith.

980
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:48,950
那等这个部门被关闭的时候
Well, I hope that's a big comfort to you

981
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,930
希望你的信念能给你点安慰
when they shut this division down.

982
01:09:51,990 --> 01:09:53,670
-看是谁回来了  -真不敢相信
- Look who it is! - Can't believe that.

983
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,140
外面怎么回事
What the hell's going on out there?

984
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,150
他们有些人需要医治
Some of these men need medical attention.

985
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:10,770
医生  有伤员
Medic, we got wounded.

986
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,120
这里
Right over here.

987
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,670
我愿意接受处分
I'd like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.

988
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,430
没这必要
That won't be necessary.

989
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:22,580
是  长官
Yes, sir.

990
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:25,300
信念哈
Faith, huh?

991
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,190
你迟到了
You're late.

992
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:38,980
没法叫车来
Couldn't call my ride.

993
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:45,420
为美国队长欢呼
Let's hear it for Captain America!

994
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:04,960
我很荣幸将此英勇勋章
I am honored to present this medal for valor

995
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:07,080
颁给我的好朋友
to my personal friend,

996
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:09,150
美国队长
Captain America!

997
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,970
美国队长
Captain America!

998
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:16,470
队长  该你出场了
Captain, that's your cue!

999
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:22,580
我还以为他会更高些
I thought he'd be taller.

1000
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:29,790
{\an8}美国队长将被颁发英勇勋章

1001
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,510
第五个在波兰  波罗的海附近
The fifth one was here in Poland, right near the Baltic.

1002
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:39,880
第六个在...
And the sixth one was

1003
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:41,510
大概
about

1004
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:45,700
这里  马奇诺防线以西三四十英里处
here, 30, 40 miles west of the Maginot Line.

1005
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,470
我就瞥了一眼
I just got a quick look.

1006
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:51,480
没有人十全十美嘛
Well, nobody's perfect.

1007
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:57,040
这些是我们已知的武器工厂
These are the weapon factories we know about.

1008
01:12:57,860 --> 01:12:58,880
据巴恩斯中士说
Sergeant Barnes said

1009
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,770
九头蛇把所有装备都运到了另一个地方
that Hydra shipped all the parts to another facility

1010
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:02,240
而在地图上没有
that isn't on this map.

1011
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,050
卡特特工  和军情六处协调
Agent Carter, coordinate with Ml6.

1012
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:06,860
发动所有同盟国去找九头蛇总部
I want every Allied eyeball looking for that main Hydra base.

1013
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:07,870
那我们呢
What about us?

1014
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:10,740
我们去给约翰・施密特一个下马威
We are going to set a fire under Johann Schmidt's ass.

1015
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:12,020
怎么样  罗杰斯
What do you say, Rogers?

1016
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:14,880
你背出了地图  你觉得你能铲除九头蛇吗
It's your map. You think you can wipe Hydra off it?

1017
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:16,150
好  长官
Yes, sir.

1018
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:17,060
我需要一支队伍
I'll need a team.

1019
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:19,230
我们已经在召集最出色的士兵
We're already putting together the best men.

1020
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:21,040
恕我直言  长官
With all due respect, sir,

1021
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:22,320
我也找了
so am I.

1022
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:24,680
是这么回事吗
So, let's get this straight.

1023
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:27,520
我们好不容易逃出来  你又要我们再去吗
We barely got out of there alive, and you want us to go back?

1024
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:29,910
差不多
Pretty much.

1025
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:33,020
听起来很有趣
Sounds rather fun, actually.

1026
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:35,370
我加入
I'm in.

1027
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:48,900
我们也加入
We're in.

1028
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,640
我永远乐意战斗
Hell, I'll always fight.

1029
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,700
但你得为我做一件事
But you got to do one thing for me.

1030
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:54,600
什么事
What's that?

1031
01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:57,560
请客喝酒
Open a tab.

1032
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:02,550
这容易
Well, that was easy.

1033
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:04,140
再来一轮
Another round.

1034
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:06,170
他们怎么喝得下这么多
Where are they putting all this stuff?

1035
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:12,160
是吧  告诉你了
See? I told you.

1036
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:14,170
他们都是笨蛋
They're all idiots.

1037
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,190
那你呢
How about you?

1038
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:20,610
你准备跟随美国队长去赴汤蹈火吗
You ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of death?

1039
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:21,680
当然不
Hell, no.

1040
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:24,180
那个布鲁克林来的傻小个子
That little guy from Brooklyn who was too

1041
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:26,230
打起架来从不放弃
dumb not to run away from a fight.

1042
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:28,900
我要跟着他
I'm following him.

1043
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,590
你还穿那套紧身衣吗
But you're keeping the outfit, right?

1044
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:37,900
知道吗
You know what?

1045
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:39,620
{\an8}美国队长  巡演取消

1046
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,630
我还真习惯了
It's kind of growing on me.

1047
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:44,510
记住啦  天下没有不散的宴席
And remember that the best of friends must part, must part

1048
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:46,830
再见  再见了
Adieu, adieu...

1049
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,740
-队长  -卡特特工
- Captain. - Agent Carter.

1050
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,000
女士
Ma'am.

1051
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,750
霍华德为你准备了些新装备
Howard has some equipment for you to try.

1052
01:14:58,750 --> 01:14:59,810
明早去看看
Tomorrow morning?

1053
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:01,190
好啊
Sounds good.

1054
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,660
看来你的精英部队已经准备上阵了
I see your top squad is prepping for duty.

1055
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:10,700
你不喜欢音乐吗
You don't like music?

1056
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:12,250
我喜欢
I do, actually.

1057
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:15,840
没准等战争结束
I might even, when this is all over,

1058
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:16,970
我还会去跳个舞
go dancing.

1059
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:18,620
那我们还等什么
Then what are we waiting for?

1060
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,080
合适的舞伴
The right partner.

1061
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,200
明早八点  队长
08:00, Captain.

1062
01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:25,870
是  女士
Yes, ma'am.

1063
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:27,100
我会到的
I'll be there.

1064
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:28,930
我成小透明了
I'm invisible.

1065
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,310
我要变成你了
I'm turning into you.

1066
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:32,960
感觉像个噩梦
It's like a horrible dream.

1067
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:34,660
别太难过了
Don't take it so hard.

1068
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,350
也许她还有个闺蜜
Maybe she's got a friend.

1069
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:40,690
发射特征不同寻常
Emission signature is unusual.

1070
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:42,990
A和B射线中性
Alpha and beta ray neutral.

1071
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,890
但罗杰斯估计没发现
Though I doubt Rogers picked up on that.

1072
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,520
看上去挺无害的
Seems harmless enough.

1073
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:53,820
搞不懂有什么可大惊小怪的
Hard to see what all the fuss is about.

1074
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:04,110
把这记下来
Write that down.

1075
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:22,290
{\an8}四百余俘虏被解救

1076
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:08,830
打扰一下  我找斯塔克先生
Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Stark.

1077
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,540
他跟菲利普斯上校在里面
He's in with Colonel Phillips.

1078
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:18,450
你想等的话  当然也可以
Of course, you're welcome to wait.

1079
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:24,440
我
I

1080
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,330
在报上看到了你的事迹
read about what you did.

1081
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,340
那事儿啊
Oh, the... Yeah.

1082
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,690
那只是...
Well, that's, you know.

1083
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:34,930
尽责而已
Just doing what needed to be done.

1084
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:36,370
听上去没那么简单
Sounded like more than that.

1085
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:38,160
你救了近四百人
You saved nearly 400 men.

1086
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:45,880
说真的  没什么大不了
Really, it's not a big deal.

1087
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:49,060
对他们的老婆来说可不是
Tell that to their wives.

1088
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:54,160
我觉得并不是所有人都结婚了
I don't think they were all married.

1089
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,470
你是个英雄
You're a hero.

1090
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:57,050
那个嘛...
Well, that you know,

1091
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,640
取决于你怎么定义...
that depends on the definition, really.

1092
01:16:58,640 --> 01:16:59,890
美国女人
The women of America,

1093
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:01,570
都欠你的情
they owe you their thanks.

1094
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:05,820
而既然她们不在这儿
And seeing as they're not here...

1095
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:15,750
队长
Captain!

1096
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:18,570
大家都在等你  没事的话就快来
We're ready for you, if you're not otherwise occupied.

1097
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,140
卡特特工  等等
Agent Carter, wait.

1098
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,630
看来找个伴也没那么难
Looks like finding a partner wasn't that hard after all.

1099
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:25,210
佩吉  不是你想的那样
Peggy, that's not what you thought it was.

1100
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:27,810
我什么都没想  队长  完全没有
I don't think anything, Captain, not one thing.

1101
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,290
你一直想成为军人  如今得偿所愿
You always wanted to be a soldier, and now you are,

1102
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:31,610
跟其他人没什么两样
just like all the rest.

1103
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:33,180
那你跟斯塔克又算什么
Well, what about you and Stark?

1104
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,950
我怎么知道你们有没有...
How do I know you two haven't been

1105
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:36,300
芝士火锅
fondue-ing?

1106
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,490
你还是一点都不懂女人
You still don't know a bloody thing about women.

1107
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,710
芝士火锅只是奶酪和面包  哥们
Fondue is just cheese and bread, my friend.

1108
01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:47,710
真的吗
Really?

1109
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:48,260
我没想到...
I didn't think...

1110
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:49,590
你就不该多想  伙计
Nor should you, pal.

1111
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:51,770
如果你自以为摸透女人了
The moment you think you know what's going on in a woman's head

1112
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:54,220
你就完蛋了
is the moment your goose is well and truly cooked.

1113
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:55,590
我嘛  更注重工作
Me, I concentrate on work,

1114
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,910
就现在来说
which at the moment

1115
01:17:56,950 --> 01:17:59,690
就是确保你和你的人都不送命
is about making sure you and your men do not get killed.

1116
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:01,450
碳聚合物
Carbon polymer.

1117
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:05,030
应该可以承受德国刺刀
Should withstand your average German bayonet.

1118
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:08,280
但九头蛇可不会用小刀对付你
Although Hydra's not going to attack you with a pocket knife.

1119
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:11,420
我听说你对这个还有了感情
I hear you're kind of attached.

1120
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,070
用起来比你想的要顺手
It's handier than you might think.

1121
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:15,420
我给你准备了几个选择
I took the liberty of coming up with some options.

1122
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:17,330
这个很有趣
This one's fun.

1123
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:19,870
里面装了继电器
She's been fitted with electrical relays

1124
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,050
-能让你...  -那这个呢
- that allow you to... - What about this one?

1125
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:22,080
不不  那件还未完工
No, no, that's just a prototype.

1126
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,130
是什么材质
What's it made of?

1127
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:24,760
振金
Vibranium.

1128
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,640
比钢强  重量则只有其三分之一
It's stronger than steel and a third the weight.

1129
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:31,480
它可以完全吸收振动
It's completely vibration absorbent.

1130
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:34,940
为何不作为全军配备
How come it's not standard issue?

1131
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:36,510
这种金属在地球上极为罕见
That's the rarest metal on Earth.

1132
01:18:36,510 --> 01:18:37,480
你手中这件
What you're holding there,

1133
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,420
是唯一的一个
that's all we've got.

1134
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:39,940
快好了吗  斯塔克先生
You quite finished, Mr. Stark?

1135
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,770
队长肯定还有事呢
I'm sure the Captain has some unfinished business.

1136
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:43,830
你觉得如何
What do you think?

1137
01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:56,010
行  挺好用的
Yes, I think it works.

1138
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:07,270
我对服装还有些想法
I had some ideas about the uniform.

1139
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,670
都听你的  伙计
Whatever you want, pal.

1140
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:16,470
你一直在失败
You are failing!

1141
01:21:17,450 --> 01:21:20,960
我们就要发动震撼全球的攻势了
We are close to an offensive that will shake the planet,

1142
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,700
现在却一推再推
yet we are continually delayed

1143
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:25,160
就因为你搞不定一个带盾牌的白痴
because you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield!

1144
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:28,050
这不是我的专长
This is hardly my area of expertise.

1145
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:30,140
我只会发明武器
I merely developed the weapons.

1146
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,990
我又不会用
I cannot fire them.

1147
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:33,930
完成你的使命  博士
Finish your mission, Doctor,

1148
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,720
别让那美国人先把我们端了
before the American finishes his.

1149
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:37,790
长官
Sir!

1150
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:41,390
我很抱歉  施密特先生
I'm sorry, Herr Schmidt.

1151
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:44,450
我们全军覆灭了
We fought to the last man.

1152
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:49,800
显然还没有全灭
Evidently not.

1153
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:04,880
还记得在科尼岛我逼你玩旋风飞车吗
Remember when I made you ride the Cyclone at Coney Island?

1154
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:06,830
记得  我吐了
Yeah, and I threw up?

1155
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:09,610
这不会是报复吧
This isn't payback, is it?

1156
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,190
怎么会呢
Now why would I do that?

1157
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:14,000
你是对的  佐拉博士在火车上
We were right. Dr. Zola's on the train.

1158
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:17,450
九头蛇调度员刚准许了他加速
Hydra dispatcher gave him permission to open up the throttle.

1159
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:20,190
不管他是去哪  他们肯定挺着急
Wherever he's going, they must need him bad.

1160
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:29,790
我们快行动  他们像是赶着去投胎
Let's get going, because they're moving like the devil.

1161
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:31,830
我们只有十秒钟空隙
We only got about a 10-second window.

1162
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:33,150
错过了
You miss that window,

1163
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,020
就要被火车撞死了
we're bugs on a windshield.

1164
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:36,100
小心脚下
Mind the gap.

1165
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:37,750
那快走吧  兄弟们
Better get moving, bugs!

1166
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:46,820
拦住他
Stop him!

1167
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:48,400
继续射击
Fire again!

1168
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:41,890
我本来就要打败他了
I had him on the ropes.

1169
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:43,030
我知道
I know you did.

1170
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:44,790
趴下
Get down!

1171
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,330
继续射击
Fire again!

1172
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:50,550
快杀了他
Kill him! Now!

1173
01:24:58,270 --> 01:24:59,270
巴基
Bucky!

1174
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:04,190
坚持住
Hang on!

1175
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:07,530
抓住我的手
Grab my hand!

1176
01:25:08,290 --> 01:25:09,240
不
No!

1177
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:13,880
坐下
Sit down.

1178
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:21,640
这是什么
What is this?

1179
01:26:21,730 --> 01:26:22,690
牛排
Steak.

1180
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,360
里面是什么
What is in it?

1181
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,190
牛肉
Cow.

1182
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:32,170
博士  你知不知道
Doctor, do you realize

1183
01:26:32,170 --> 01:26:34,020
这么一块高级牛肉
how difficult it is to get ahold

1184
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:36,390
在这里多难搞到
of a prime cut like that out here?

1185
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:39,410
我不吃肉
I don't eat meat.

1186
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:43,120
-为什么不吃  -吃不惯
- Why not? - It disagrees with me.

1187
01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:46,570
氰化物怎么样  也让你肚子不舒服吗
How about cyanide? Does that give you the rumbly tummy, too?

1188
01:26:49,090 --> 01:26:52,220
每次我们想活捉九头蛇的特工
Every Hydra agent that we've tried to take alive

1189
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:55,360
都在我们能阻止前服毒自尽了
has crunched a little pill before we can stop him.

1190
01:26:55,930 --> 01:26:56,960
可你没有
But not you.

1191
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,150
所以  我的绝妙推论是
So, here is my brilliant theory.

1192
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:04,370
你不想死
You want to live.

1193
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:08,300
你是在威胁我  上校
You're trying to intimidate me, Colonel.

1194
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:09,900
我给你带了晚餐
I bought you dinner.

1195
01:27:15,670 --> 01:27:19,230
由于他所提供的宝贵信息
"Given the valuable information he has provided

1196
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:22,640
以及作为他大力合作的交换条件
"And in exchange for his full cooperation,

1197
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:26,350
佐拉博士将被送返瑞士
"Dr. Zola is being remanded to Switzerland"?

1198
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:28,840
今早我把消息发去了华盛顿
I sent that message to Washington this morning,

1199
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:30,600
当然是被加密了
of course it was encoded.

1200
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:32,980
你们的人还没解开吧
You guys haven't broken those codes, have you?

1201
01:27:33,370 --> 01:27:34,740
不然可就尴尬了
That would be awkward.

1202
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:36,680
施密特不会相信的
Schmidt will know this is a lie.

1203
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,370
不管怎样他都会杀了你  博士
He's going to kill you anyway, Doc.

1204
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:40,130
你成了累赘
You're a liability.

1205
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:42,820
你知道最多他的秘密
You know more about Schmidt than anyone.

1206
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:44,800
而且...
And

1207
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:45,960
最后一个被你害死的人
the last guy you cost us

1208
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,070
是罗杰斯队长最好的朋友
was Captain Rogers' closest friend,

1209
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:50,690
所以我可不敢说你会受到多好的保护
so I wouldn't count on the very best of protection.

1210
01:27:52,030 --> 01:27:53,120
保自己
It's you

1211
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:54,530
还是施密特
or Schmidt.

1212
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,300
你只有这两条路
It's just the hand you've been dealt.

1213
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:03,410
施密特坚信他是在追随众神的脚步
Schmidt believes he walks in the footsteps of the gods.

1214
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:07,760
只有得到整个世界他才会满足
Only the world itself will satisfy him.

1215
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,780
你也知道他疯了吧
You do realize that's nuts, don't you?

1216
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,110
怎么
What?

1217
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:14,230
疯不疯狂已经不重要了
The sanity of the plan is of no consequence.

1218
01:28:14,230 --> 01:28:16,630
-为什么  -因为他做得到
- And why is that? - Because he can do it!

1219
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:18,430
他的目标是什么
What's his target?

1220
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:22,040
他的目标
His target

1221
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,320
是全世界
is everywhere.

1222
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:46,650
明天
Tomorrow,

1223
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,950
九头蛇将会称霸世界
Hydra will stand master of the world,

1224
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:55,200
借瓦尔基里之翼获得胜利
borne to victory on the wings of the Valkyrie.

1225
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:59,730
敌人的武器对我们都不堪一击
Our enemies' weapons will be powerless against us.

1226
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:02,100
若是一架飞机被击落
If they shoot down one plane,

1227
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:05,110
还有数百架飞机会予以猛烈回击
hundreds more will rain fire upon them!

1228
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,600
砍掉一颗头
If they cut off one head,

1229
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,920
会再长出两个
two more shall take its place.

1230
01:29:15,770 --> 01:29:17,050
九头蛇万岁
Hail Hydra.

1231
01:29:17,190 --> 01:29:18,800
九头蛇万岁
Hail Hydra.

1232
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:20,370
九头蛇万岁
Hail Hydra.

1233
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:21,890
九头蛇万岁
Hail Hydra.

1234
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:23,460
九头蛇万岁
Hail Hydra.

1235
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:24,810
九头蛇万岁
Hail Hydra.

1236
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:26,200
九头蛇万岁
Hail Hydra.

1237
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:28,100
九头蛇万岁
Hail Hydra.

1238
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:36,810
伦敦地区依然在施行宵禁
Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area.

1239
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:38,820
请等待警报解除
Please wait for the all-clear.

1240
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:40,680
请注意
Your attention, please.

1241
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:44,620
所有市民请待在家里  等待进一步通知
All citizens shall remain indoors until further notice.

1242
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:47,780
伦敦地区依然在施行宵禁
Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area.

1243
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:57,670
厄斯金博士说过
Dr. Erskine said that

1244
01:29:58,250 --> 01:30:00,620
血清不光会影响肌肉
the serum wouldn't just affect my muscles,

1245
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:02,660
也会影响细胞
it would affect my cells.

1246
01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:07,800
产生一个再生和愈合的保护系统
Create a protective system of regeneration and healing.

1247
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:08,940
也就是说
Which means

1248
01:30:11,630 --> 01:30:13,010
我不会醉
I can't get drunk.

1249
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:16,170
你知道吗
Did you know that?

1250
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:21,320
你的新陈代谢速率是常人的四倍
Your metabolism burns four times faster than the average person.

1251
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:25,180
博士觉得那可能是副作用之一
He thought it could be one of the side effects.

1252
01:30:30,490 --> 01:30:32,050
那不是你的错
It wasn't your fault.

1253
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:34,900
你看报告了吗
Did you read the report?

1254
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:35,810
看了
Yes.

1255
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,940
那你该知道是我害死了他
Then you know that's not true.

1256
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:39,510
你尽力了
You did everything you could.

1257
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:44,780
你相信你朋友吗
Did you believe in your friend?

1258
01:30:45,310 --> 01:30:46,660
你尊重他吗
Did you respect him?

1259
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:50,080
那就别再自责
Then stop blaming yourself.

1260
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,740
尊重巴恩斯自己的选择
Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice.

1261
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:55,550
他肯定认为值得为你赴汤蹈火
He damn well must have thought you were worth it.

1262
01:30:57,370 --> 01:30:59,010
我要抓到施密特
I'm going after Schmidt.

1263
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:03,590
只要九头蛇没被杀绝或逮捕  我就不会罢休
I'm not gonna stop until all of Hydra is dead or captured.

1264
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:06,990
你不是一个人
You won't be alone.

1265
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:12,140
约翰・施密特该被扔进疯人院
Johann Schmidt belongs in a bughouse.

1266
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:13,190
他觉得自己是神
He thinks he's a god,

1267
01:31:13,190 --> 01:31:15,290
还要炸掉半个世界  以证明这一点
and he's willing to blow up half the world to prove it,

1268
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:17,000
就从美国开始
starting with the USA.

1269
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,880
施密特使用的力量超出我们的能力
Schmidt's working with powers beyond our capabilities.

1270
01:31:20,130 --> 01:31:21,780
只要他穿过大西洋
He gets across the Atlantic,

1271
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:25,290
就能在一小时内夷平整个东海岸
he will wipe out the entire Eastern Seaboard in an hour.

1272
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:30,400
我们有多少时间
How much time we got?

1273
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:33,150
据那位新朋友的说法  不到24小时
According to my new best friend, under 24 hours.

1274
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,250
他现在人在哪
Where is he now?

1275
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:36,020
九头蛇最后的基地
Hydra's last base is here.

1276
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:37,840
在阿尔卑斯山脉
In the Alps,

1277
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,760
地表下五百英尺
500 feet below the surface.

1278
01:31:42,290 --> 01:31:43,900
那我们该怎么做
So what are we supposed to do?

1279
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:46,460
又不能直接敲门进去
I mean, it's not like we can just knock on the front door.

1280
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:47,960
怎么不能
Why not?

1281
01:31:53,410 --> 01:31:55,150
我们就这么做
That's exactly what we're going to do.

1282
01:34:01,110 --> 01:34:05,250
自大也许不是美国人的独有特征
Arrogance may not be a uniquely American trait,

1283
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:08,070
但不得不说你诠释的比别人都出色
but I must say, you do it better than anyone.

1284
01:34:10,370 --> 01:34:12,950
然而即便是你
But there are limits

1285
01:34:13,490 --> 01:34:15,850
也有做不到的事  队长
to what even you can do, Captain.

1286
01:34:16,110 --> 01:34:19,610
还是厄斯金的说法有所不同
Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?

1287
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:21,420
他跟我说你疯了
He told me you were insane.

1288
01:34:25,790 --> 01:34:27,400
他嫉妒我天赋异禀
He resented my genius

1289
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:31,370
还企图剥夺本就属于我的东西
and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine.

1290
01:34:31,370 --> 01:34:33,570
可他却给了你一切
But he gave you everything.

1291
01:34:35,530 --> 01:34:36,450
那么
So,

1292
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:40,970
你有什么特别之处吗
what made you so special?

1293
01:34:44,370 --> 01:34:45,300
没有
Nothing.

1294
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:48,320
我就是个布鲁克林的小子
I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.

1295
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,300
我可以和你耗一整天
I can do this all day.

1296
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,410
你当然可以  当然了
Of course you can, of course.

1297
01:35:03,410 --> 01:35:07,100
但可惜的是我有点忙
But, unfortunately, I am on a tight schedule.

1298
01:35:12,650 --> 01:35:13,600
我也是
So am I.

1299
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:27,450
罗杰斯
Rogers!

1300
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:29,410
这个你用得着
You might need this!

1301
01:35:29,790 --> 01:35:30,730
谢了
Thanks!

1302
01:35:41,730 --> 01:35:44,440
我们进去了  立即进攻
We're in! Assault team, go!

1303
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:45,480
行动
Move out!

1304
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:55,970
保持距离
Keep your spacing!

1305
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:38,290
砍掉一颗头  会再长出两...
Cut off one head, two more shall...

1306
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:41,170
那就把这两个也砍掉
Let's go find two more!

1307
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:05,990
停火
Cease fire.

1308
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:09,240
你迟到了
You're late.

1309
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:13,510
你不是要去...
Weren't you about to...

1310
01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:14,540
哦对
Right.

1311
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:47,920
{\an8}目标  纽约市

1312
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:29,390
上来
Get in!

1313
01:38:58,530 --> 01:38:59,280
稳住
Keep it steady!

1314
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:00,150
等等
Wait!

1315
01:39:05,290 --> 01:39:06,290
去抓到他
Go get him.

1316
01:39:08,550 --> 01:39:10,150
我可不会吻你
I'm not kissing you!

1317
01:40:07,810 --> 01:40:09,970
{\an8}芝加哥

1318
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:13,270
{\an8}纽约市

1319
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,640
你就是怎么都不放弃是吧
You don't give up, do you?

1320
01:42:51,970 --> 01:42:52,900
没错
Nope!

1321
01:44:01,510 --> 01:44:04,230
你本可以拥有神的力量
You could have the power of the gods!

1322
01:44:04,950 --> 01:44:06,830
却在胸口挂面国旗
Yet you wear a flag on your chest

1323
01:44:06,830 --> 01:44:09,820
就以为在打国家之战了吗
and think you fight a battle of nations!

1324
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:12,890
我已经看见了未来  队长
I have seen the future, Captain!

1325
01:44:13,490 --> 01:44:16,470
-未来可没有国旗  -我的未来不是那样的
- There are no flags! - Not my future!

1326
01:44:30,370 --> 01:44:31,730
你都干了什么
What have you done?

1327
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:33,280
不
No!

1328
01:45:32,550 --> 01:45:33,510
{\an8}目标  纽约市

1329
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:44,100
回复  我是罗杰斯队长  收到吗
Come in. This is Captain Rogers. Do you read me?

1330
01:45:44,110 --> 01:45:45,320
罗杰斯队长  你...
Captain Rogers, what is your...

1331
01:45:45,330 --> 01:45:46,660
史蒂夫  是你吗  你没事吗
Steve, is that you? Are you all right?

1332
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:48,470
佩吉  施密特死了
Peggy, Schmidt's dead!

1333
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,010
飞机呢
What about the plane?

1334
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:54,170
这个比较难解释
That's a little bit tougher to explain.

1335
01:45:54,390 --> 01:45:57,060
告诉我你的坐标  我给你找个安全降落点
Give me your coordinates. I'll find you a safe landing site.

1336
01:45:58,010 --> 01:45:59,890
没法安全降落了
There's not gonna be a safe landing.

1337
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:01,870
但我会尝试迫降
But I can try and force it down.

1338
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:04,090
我让霍华德来听  他知道怎么做
I'll get Howard on the line. He'll know what to do.

1339
01:46:04,090 --> 01:46:05,130
没时间了
There's not enough time.

1340
01:46:05,130 --> 01:46:07,780
这架飞机正飞速冲纽约驶去
This thing's moving too fast and it's heading for New York.

1341
01:46:12,470 --> 01:46:14,110
我得让飞机坠海
I got to put her in the water.

1342
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:15,390
求你  别这么做
Please, don't do this.

1343
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:17,460
我们还有时间  能想到办法
We have time. We can work it out.

1344
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:18,760
我现在在无人地带
Right now I'm in the middle of nowhere.

1345
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:21,180
要是不立即行动  会有很多人丧命
If I wait any longer, a lot of people are gonna die.

1346
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:27,870
佩吉
Peggy,

1347
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:30,990
这是我的选择
this is my choice.

1348
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:56,260
佩吉
Peggy?

1349
01:46:57,510 --> 01:46:58,450
我在
I'm here.

1350
01:47:01,530 --> 01:47:03,770
那支舞得改天再跳了
I'm gonna need a rain check on that dance.

1351
01:47:12,410 --> 01:47:13,330
好吧
All right.

1352
01:47:16,830 --> 01:47:19,540
下周六  在鹳鸟俱乐部
A week, next Saturday, at the Stork Club.

1353
01:47:20,710 --> 01:47:21,640
没问题
You got it.

1354
01:47:23,890 --> 01:47:24,960
八点整
8:00 on the dot.

1355
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:26,550
不准迟到
Don't you dare be late.

1356
01:47:27,310 --> 01:47:28,290
明白吗
Understood?

1357
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:32,170
我还是不会跳舞
You know, I still don't know how to dance.

1358
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:39,770
我会教你
I'll show you how.

1359
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:41,300
你来就好
Just be there.

1360
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,780
我们让乐队演奏点舒缓的曲子
We'll have the band play something slow.

1361
01:47:48,310 --> 01:47:49,770
我可不想踩到你的...
I'd hate to step on your...

1362
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:53,840
史蒂夫
Steve?

1363
01:47:56,770 --> 01:47:57,690
史蒂夫
Steve?

1364
01:48:01,270 --> 01:48:02,320
史蒂夫
Steve?

1365
01:48:55,090 --> 01:48:56,210
{\an8}欧战胜利日

1366
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:02,600
敬队长
To the Captain.

1367
01:49:15,290 --> 01:49:16,190
先生
Sir?

1368
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:28,140
去下一个坐标点
Take us to the next grid point.

1369
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:30,340
但这里没有残骸的痕迹
But there's no trace of wreckage.

1370
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:33,500
能量信号也只到这儿了
And the energy signature stops here.

1371
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:36,580
继续找就是了
Just keep looking.

1372
01:49:50,310 --> 01:49:52,520
{\an8}机密  非在职

1373
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:47,230
曲线球  高高地打出界外
Curve ball, high and outside for ball one.

1374
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:52,080
道奇队现在四比四平手
So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4.

1375
01:50:52,970 --> 01:50:55,360
观众们都知道  只要他一挥棒
And the crowd well knows that with one swing of his bat,

1376
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:58,370
这位小伙子就能扭转乾坤
this fellow's capable of making it a brand-new game again.

1377
01:50:59,590 --> 01:51:02,660
今天埃贝茨球场的比赛太精彩了
Just an absolutely gorgeous day here at Ebbets Field.

1378
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:06,440
费城人队把比分控制在了四比四平
The Phillies have managed to tie it up at 4-4.

1379
01:51:07,630 --> 01:51:09,710
而道奇队还有三人在场上
But the Dodgers have three men on.

1380
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:17,450
帕森上月在费城让雷泽吃了瘪
Pearson beaned Reiser in Philadelphia last month.

1381
01:51:17,450 --> 01:51:20,310
这位年轻人肯定想回敬他吧
Wouldn't the youngster like a hit here to return the favor?

1382
01:51:21,150 --> 01:51:23,470
皮特倾身  投球了
Pete leans in. Here's the pitch.

1383
01:51:23,610 --> 01:51:27,010
挥棒  球飞向右方  经过里兹
Swung on. A line to the right. And it gets past Rizzo.

1384
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:29,700
跑三段就能得分
Three runs will score.

1385
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:33,480
雷泽上三垒  杜奇在指挥他上垒
Reiser heads to third. Durocher's going to wave him in.

1386
01:51:34,570 --> 01:51:36,910
接球  但他们拼不过他
Here comes the relay, but they won't get him.

1387
01:51:38,550 --> 01:51:39,530
早上好
Good morning.

1388
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:42,920
或者该说  下午好
Or should I say afternoon?

1389
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:43,960
天哪
Oh my god.

1390
01:51:44,390 --> 01:51:45,390
我在哪
Where am I?

1391
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:48,490
你在纽约市的一间术后恢复室里
You're in a recovery room in New York City.

1392
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:53,890
道奇队以八比四领先了  道奇队
The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4. Oh, Dodgers!

1393

大家都激动得站起来了
Everyone is on their feet.

1394
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:57,960
今天真是场精彩绝伦的比赛啊  各位
What a game we have here today, folks.

1395
01:51:57,960 --> 01:51:59,540
真精彩
What a game, indeed.

1396
01:51:59,540 --> 01:52:00,860
我到底在哪
Where am I really?

1397
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:03,870
我不太明白你的意思
I'm afraid I don't understand.

1398
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:05,780
这场比赛
The game.
