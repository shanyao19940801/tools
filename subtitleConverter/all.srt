3
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:31,366
宇宙立方已经苏醒
The Tesseract has awakened.

4
00:00:33,202 --> 00:00:38,159
它正在一个渺小世界里，人类的世界
It is on a little world, a human world.

5
00:00:38,874 --> 00:00:42,207
人类想利用它的能量
They would wield its power,

6
00:00:42,586 --> 00:00:48,256
他们不会成功只有我们的盟友才能利用它
but our ally knows its workings as they never will.

7
00:00:49,802 --> 00:00:52,885
他将作为先锋
He is ready to lead

8
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:58,517
而我们智塔利人大军将紧随其后
and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.

9
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:02,517
给他一个地球
A world will be his.

10
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:05,850
我们拥有宇宙
The universe, yours.

11
00:01:06,068 --> 00:01:11,940
至于人类，除了等死，还能做什么？
And the humans,what can they do but burn?

12
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:27,250
全体人员注意
All personnel,

13
00:01:27,423 --> 00:01:29,711
疏散命令已获确认
the evacuation order has been confirmed.

14
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:30,675


15
00:01:30,862 --> 00:01:33,051
（联合暗能量行动）
(DIRECTING AGENTS)

16
00:02:01,624 --> 00:02:03,081
情况有多糟糕？
How bad is it?

17
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:06,577
长官，最糟的就是我们不知道情况
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

18
00:02:10,174 --> 00:02:13,090
绍韦博士四小时前侦测到立方发出的能量波
Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago.

19
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:15,091
宇航局未批准绍韦进入测试阶段
NASA didn't authorise Selvig to go to test phase.

20
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:17,461
他没有测试，当时他根本不在房间里
He wasn't testing it.He wasn't even in the room.

21
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:18,676
是自动触发的
Spontaneous event.

22
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:19,963
宇宙立方自行启动？
It just turned itself on?

23
00:02:20,184 --> 00:02:21,214
现在的能级达到多少了？
Where are the energy levels now?

24
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:23,593
攀升中，绍韦没能把它停下来,我们因此下令撤离
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered evac.

25
00:02:23,813 --> 00:02:25,010
完全撤离还要多久？
How long to get everyone out?

26
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:26,558
半小时应该够了
Campus should be clear in the next half-hour.

27
00:02:26,774 --> 00:02:28,018
再快点
Do better.

28
00:02:28,984 --> 00:02:30,941
长官，撤离也许是徒劳无益的
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

29
00:02:31,153 --> 00:02:32,528
那我应该让他们都回去歇着？
We should tell them to go back to sleep?

30
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:34,944
如果我们无法控制宇宙立方的力量
If we can't control the Tesseract's energy,

31
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:37,481
也就不会有「安全距离」一说了
there may not be a minimum safe distance.

32
00:02:37,618 --> 00:02:40,445
你去确保二阶段原型机的安全转移
I need you to make sure the Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.

33
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,370


34
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:42,660
长官，真的要优先考虑它们？
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

35
00:02:42,873 --> 00:02:44,580
除非到世界末日
Until such time as the world ends,

36
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,747
否则我们就得这么来
we will act as though it intends to spin on.

37
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:49,086
把下面的设备都搬走
Clear out the tech below.

38
00:02:49,296 --> 00:02:51,786
二阶段原型机的每一个部件都要装车运走
Every piece of Phase 2 on a truck and gone.

39
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:53,086
遵命，长官
Yes, sir.

40
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:54,671
跟我来
With me.

41
00:02:57,763 --> 00:02:58,758
说说情况吧，博士
Talk to me, Doctor.

42
00:03:00,558 --> 00:03:01,932
局长
Director.

43
00:03:02,143 --> 00:03:03,802
我们确切知道的情况有哪些？
Is there anything we know for certain?

44
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,260
宇宙立方不大听话
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

45
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,266
- 你在开玩笑？- 不，我不是开玩笑
- Is that supposed to be funny? - No, it's not funny at all.

46
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:12,982
宇宙立方不仅被唤醒了，还在自行活动
The Tesseract is not only active, she's behaving.

47
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,189
拔了电源试试？
I assume you pulled the plug.

48
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:16,111
它自身是个能量源
She's an energy source.

49
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:19,358
我们关闭了电源，它又重新打开
We turn off the power,she turns it back on.

50
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:20,654
如果它能级达到峰值
If she reaches peak level...

51
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:24,284
博士，这不正是我们所需要的吗？利用宇宙的能量
We prepared for this, Doctor. Harnessing energy from space.

52
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:25,872
但是我们没办法控制
But we don't have the harness.

53
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:27,278
我们离利用还差得远呢
My calculations are far from complete.

54
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,371
它在释放干扰与辐射
And she's throwing off interference, radiation.

55
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:32,294
低能级的伽玛射线，没什么危害
Nothing harmful,low levels of gamma radiation.

56
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,040
也许会有危害
That can be harmful.

57
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:36,668
巴顿探员呢？
Where's Agent Barton?

58
00:03:36,843 --> 00:03:38,550
鹰眼？
The Hawk?

59
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:41,467
一如既往，在他的鹰巢里
Up in his nest, as usual.

60
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,723
巴顿探员，请回答
Agent Barton, report.

61
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:46,763
我让你来
I gave you this detail

62
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:48,471
是希望你能够近距离进行观察
so you could keep a close eye on things.

63
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:50,062
我站远点看得更清楚
Well, I see better from a distance.

64
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:52,229
你有看到什么东西激活它了吗？
Have you seen anything that might set this thing off?

65
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:54,814
博士，能量又达到峰值了
Doctor, it's spiking again.

66
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:56,402
没有人员进出
No one's come or gone.

67
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:58,236
绍韦也没问题
And Selvig's clean.

68
00:03:58,448 --> 00:04:00,736
没人与外界联系或传输信息
No contacts, no IMs.

69
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,033
如果有什么扰动，也不来自这端，长官
If there was any tampering, sir,it wasn't at this end.

70
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,329
「来自这端」？
"At this end"?

71
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:10,370
是啊，立方不是通往宇宙另一端的通道吗？
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right?

72
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:13,491
通道是双向的
Doors open from both sides.

73
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,583
还是不行…
Not yet.

74
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,509


75
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:20,511


76
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:26,610
先生，请把矛放下
Sir, please put down the spear.

77
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,293


78
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:36,754


79
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:39,007


80
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:40,425


81
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:45,263


82
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:47,098


83
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:04,949


84
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,111
你是有心之人
You have heart.

85
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,665


86
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,183
不要
Please don't.

87
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,181
我还要它呢
I still need that.

88
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,860
没必要把事情弄那么复杂
This doesn't have to get any messier.

89
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,268
当然有必要
Of course it does.

90
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,362
我不远万里，就是为了它
I've come too far for anything else.

91
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,112
我是来自亚斯加特的洛基
I am Loki, of Asgard

92
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,201
我肩负着光荣的使命
and I am burdened with glorious purpose.

93
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,825
洛基
Loki,

94
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,614
托尔的弟弟
brother of Thor.

95
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:01,290
你我族类毫无恩怨
We have no quarrel with your people.

96
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:04,458
蚂蚁与靴子也毫无恩怨
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

97
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,709
你也打算踩死我们？
Are you planning to step on us?

98
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,135
我给你们带来福音
I come with glad tidings

99
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,298
为整个世界带来解脱
of a world made free.

100
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:14,679
怎么解脱？
Free from what?

101
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,221
从自由中解脱
Freedom.

102
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,391
自由是生命中最大的谎言
Freedom is life's great lie.

103
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:23,021
当你内心接受了这观念
Once you accept that, in your heart,

104
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:25,363


105
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,404
你就将获得安宁
you will know peace.

106
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,154
你嘴上说「安宁」
Yeah, you say "peace,"

107
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,195
但我觉得你想表达的却恰恰相反
I kind of think you mean the other thing.

108
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,903
长官，霍利局长在拖延时间
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

109
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,451
这地方马上就要爆炸了
This place is about to blow

110
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,291
我们会被压在几十米的岩石下
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.

111
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,825
他想活埋了我们
He means to bury us.

112
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,160
像古代的法老一样
Like the pharaohs of old.

113
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,337
他说得对，传送门正在自我坍塌
He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself.

114
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,755
离临界状态只有两分钟了
We've got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.

115
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,131
好吧
Well, then.

116
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:51,973


117
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:06,981
我要用这些车
I need these vehicles.

118
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,196
- 那是谁？ - 我也不知道
- Who's that? - They didn't tell me.

119
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,657
希尔！
Hill!

120
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,361
能听到吗？
Do you CODY?

121
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:21,411
巴顿叛变了
Barton has turned.

122
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:22,879


123
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:37,307
他们拿走了宇宙立方！拦下他们！
They have the Tesseract! Shut them down!

124
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,219


125
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,925
快走，别管它了，快走！
Okay, let's go. No, leave it. Go!

126
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,527
楼上撤离完毕了，长官，你得走了
We're clear upstairs, sir. You need to go.

127
00:09:57,515 --> 00:09:58,516


128
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:26,752


129
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:53,404


130
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,826
局长？
Director?

131
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,660
霍利局长，能听到吗？
Director Fury, do you copy?

132
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,165
宇宙立方已落入敌手
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.

133
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,828
有人受伤，希尔，你那边呢？
I have men down. Hill?

134
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,047
还有很多人被埋
A lot of men still under.

135
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,967
不清楚有多少生还者
I don't know how many survivors.

136
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:20,339
发布命令
Sound a general call.

137
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,261
所有没参加救援工作的人员
I want every living soul not working rescue

138
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:23,384
都去寻找那个箱子
looking for that briefcase.

139
00:11:23,598 --> 00:11:24,629
收到
Roger that.

140
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,134
古逊，赶回基地，这是七级事件
Coulson, get back to base. This is a Level Seven.

141
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:30,806
我们的战争
As of right now,

142
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:32,480
就此开始
we are at war.

143
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:35,472
我们该做什么？
What do we do?

144
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:48,428
复仇者联盟

145
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,604


146
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,191


147
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:16,055
今晚没按照我的预想进行
This is not how I wanted this evening to go.

148
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:15,778


149
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,816
我知道你对今晚的预想
I know how you wanted this evening to go.

150
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,106
相信我
Believe me

151
00:12:19,237 --> 00:12:20,268
现实比预想好一点
this is better.

152
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,112
你现在为谁工作？
Who are you working for?

153
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,068
莱曼托夫吗？
Lermentov, yes?

154
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,495
他觉得
Does he think

155
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:30,913
我们需要他的允许
we have to go through him

156
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,665
才能运走我们的货物？
to move our cargo?

157
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,461
我还以为索罗霍布将军负责出口生意呢
I thought General Solohob is in charge of the export business.

158
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,755
索罗霍布
Solohob

159
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:43,006
只是中间人罢了
a bagman, a front.

160
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:49,634
过时的情报害了你
Your outdated information betrays you.

161
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,978
大名鼎鼎的黑寡妇
The famous Black Widow

162
00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:00,025
也不过是个漂亮的花瓶
and she turns out to be simply another pretty face.

163
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:04,070
你真觉得我很漂亮？
You really think I'm pretty?

164
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:08,859
告诉莱曼托夫我们货物的运输
Tell Lermentov we don't need him

165
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:12,744
还轮不到他来插手
to move the tanks.

166
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,329
他已是明日黄花了
Tell him he is out.

167
00:13:16,753 --> 00:13:18,377
不过
Well...

168
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,000
你也许只能用写的了
...you may have to write it down.

169
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:23,888


170
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,055


171
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:29,643


172
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,434
找她的
It's for her.

173
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:38,178
听仔细了
You listen carefully

174
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:40,889
你在114号萨伦斯基广场三楼
You're at 1-14 Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.

175
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,275
有架F22在八英里外待命
We have an F-22 exactly eight miles out.

176
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,112
让那女人接电话，否则不等你跑到大厅
Put the woman on the phone or I will blow up the block

177
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:48,363
我就炸平整条街
before you can make the lobby.

178
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,955
- 我们需要你回来 - 开玩笑哪？我在工作
- We need you to come in. - Are you kidding? I'm working.

179
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,448
这边情况更加危急
This takes precedence.

180
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,294
我都审问了一半了
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

181
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:02,253
那蠢货什么都招了
This moron is giving me everything.

182
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:05,293
我什么都没说啊
I don't give everything.

183
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:08,093
听好了，我现在走不开
Look, you can't pull me out of this right now.

184
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,215
娜塔莎
Natasha...

185
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:12,299
巴顿被精神控制了
Barton's been compromised.

186
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,345
稍等片刻
Let me put you on hold.

187
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:19,777


188
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,531


189
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,534


190
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,123


191
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:38,963


192
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:40,130


193
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:46,387


194
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:54,853


195
00:14:59,105 --> 00:15:00,099
巴顿人呢？
Where is Barton now?

196
00:15:00,272 --> 00:15:01,766
- 不知道   - 还活着吧？
- We don'tknow. - But he's alive?

197
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:04,769
应该是，等你回来再细说
We think so. I'll brief you on everything when you get back.

198
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:07,066
不过你得先和大块头聊聊
But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.

199
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,363
古逊你知道，相比他据我千里之外，史塔克更信任我
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me.

200
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:14,073
噢，我去找史塔克，你去找大块头
Oh, I've got Stark. You get the big guy.

201
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:18,335


202
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,385


203
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:37,605


204
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:38,606


205
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:39,806
你是谁？
Who are you?

206
00:15:40,271 --> 00:15:41,349
快出去！
Get out!

207
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,970
会传染的！
There is sickness here!

208
00:15:44,108 --> 00:15:45,103
你是医生吗？
You're a doctor.

209
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,113


210
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:48,098
我爸爸昏迷不醒了
My father's not waking up!

211
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:50,063
他发烧了，还一直呻吟
He has a fever and he's moaning

212
00:15:50,197 --> 00:15:51,275
但眼睛却睁不开
but his eyes won't open.

213
00:15:51,407 --> 00:15:52,402
慢点
Slow down.

214
00:15:53,951 --> 00:15:55,029
我爸爸
My father...

215
00:15:57,413 --> 00:15:58,408
像他们一样？
Like them?

216
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:01,170


217
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:03,662
求你了
Please.

218
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,054


219
00:16:30,863 --> 00:16:33,151
你该先收钱的，班纳
You should've got paid up front, Banner.

220
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:36,063
对一个需要远离压力的人来说
You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress

221
00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:39,534
你居然选择住在这种地方
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

222
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,495
我靠的并不是远离压力
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

223
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,198
那是靠什么，瑜伽？
Then what is it? Yoga?

224
00:16:47,378 --> 00:16:50,544
把我引到郊区，聪明的决定
You brought me to the edge of the city. Smart.

225
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:55,176
我猜我已被重兵包围了
I assume the whole place is surrounded.

226
00:16:55,637 --> 00:16:57,011
只有你我二人
Just you and me.

227
00:16:58,264 --> 00:17:00,303
你的小演员哪？
And your actress buddy?

228
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:02,473
她也是个间谍？那么小就入行了？
Is she a spy, too? They start that young?

229
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:04,138
我入行时也不大
I did.

230
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:05,384
你是谁？
Who are you?

231
00:17:05,605 --> 00:17:06,719
娜塔莎·罗曼诺夫
Natasha Romanoff.

232
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:11,395
你是来取我性命的吗，罗曼诺夫小姐？
Are you here to kill me, Ms. Romanoff?

233
00:17:11,611 --> 00:17:14,315
这可不是一般人能完成的任务
Because that's not going to work out for everyone.

234
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:16,985
当然不是，我是代表神盾局来的
No, of course not. I'm here on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

235
00:17:18,743 --> 00:17:20,236
神盾局
S.H.I.E.L.D.

236
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:23,033
他们怎么找到我的？
How did they find me?

237
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:24,830
我们一直关注着你，博士
We never lost you, Doctor.

238
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,036
只是保持了距离
We've kept our distance.

239
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:29,241
还帮你挡下了些不速之客
Even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent.

240
00:17:29,754 --> 00:17:30,749
为什么这样？
Why?

241
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,251
尼克·霍利似乎很信任你
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

242
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:35,090
但现在我们需要你的加入
But now we need you to come in.

243
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:37,925
如果我拒绝呢？
What if I say no?

244
00:17:38,138 --> 00:17:40,260
我会说服你的
I'll persuade you.

245
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:46,720
要是「另一个我」说不呢？
And what if the other guy says no?

246
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:49,062
你们已经一年多没出事了
You've been more than a year without an incident.

247
00:17:49,274 --> 00:17:51,846
你总想让这个纪录延续吧
I don't think you want to break that streak.

248
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,691
好吧，我并非时时刻刻都能控制住自己
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

249
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,946
博士，一场全球性的大灾变很可能就要降临
Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe.

250
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:03,904
这些正是我一直试图远离的
Well, those I actively try to avoid.

251
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:06,286
这东西
This

252
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:08,870
就是宇宙立方
is the Tesseract.

253
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:11,871
它有足以夷平整个地球的能量
It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.

254
00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:16,873
霍利想让我怎么做，把它吃了？
What does Fury want me to do, swallow it?

255
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:19,548
它被人夺走了，霍利希望你可以找到它
He wants you to find it. It's been taken.

256
00:18:20,388 --> 00:18:24,551
它释放的伽玛射线强度太弱 我们无法追踪
It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace.

257
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:27,684
没有人比你更懂伽玛射线了
There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do.

258
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:30,682
所以我才来找你
If there was, that's where I'd be.

259
00:18:31,274 --> 00:18:33,431
那么说，霍利不是派你来抓怪物的？
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

260
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:34,895
至少他没这么说
Not that he's told me.

261
00:18:35,111 --> 00:18:37,269
他什么都跟你说了？
And he tells you everything?

262
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:39,322
和霍利谈谈吧，他现在需要你
Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.

263
00:18:39,449 --> 00:18:40,479
需要把我关笼子里？
He needs me in a cage?

264
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:41,611
没人打算把你关在…
No one's going to put you in a...

265
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:42,779
别骗我了！
Stop lying to me!

266
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:43,916


267
00:18:46,998 --> 00:18:49,618
对不起，又失态了
I'm sorry. That was mean.

268
00:18:50,585 --> 00:18:52,742
我只是想看看你的反应
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

269
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:56,916
咱们好好说话
Why don't we do this the easy way

270
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,377
你也别用枪指着我
where you don't use that

271
00:18:58,593 --> 00:19:02,506
那家伙也就不会添乱
and the other guy doesn't make a mess.

272
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:04,586
好吗？
Okay?

273
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,927
娜塔莎？
Natasha?

274
00:19:12,607 --> 00:19:13,637
退后
Stand down.

275
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:16,150
一切顺利
We're good here.

276
00:19:17,987 --> 00:19:19,529
这叫「只有你我二人」
"Just you and me."

277
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:24,272
这有些过火了，局长
This is out of line, Director.

278
00:19:24,494 --> 00:19:26,901
你试图运用你不能控制的力量
You're dealing with forces you can't control.

279
00:19:27,329 --> 00:19:30,779
议员先生，你上过战场吗，真枪实弹的？
You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight?

280
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:33,786
你觉得绝对控制存在吗？
Did you feel an overabundance of control?

281
00:19:34,002 --> 00:19:37,370
你是说亚斯加特正与我们行星开战？
You're saying that this Asgard is declaring war on our planet?

282
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:40,126
不是亚斯加特，只是洛基
Not Asgard. Loki.

283
00:19:40,342 --> 00:19:43,128
肯定不止他一人，另一个呢？
He can't be working alone.What about the other one?

284
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:44,292
他的哥哥
His brother.

285
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,468
根据我们的情报，他并非我们的敌人
Our intelligence says Thor is not a hostile

286
00:19:46,682 --> 00:19:47,677
但他离我们太远
but he's worlds away.

287
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,640
我们也不能指望他帮忙
We can't depend on him to help, either.

288
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:50,763
全得看我们自己
It's up to us.

289
00:19:50,894 --> 00:19:53,515
这就是你需要全力研发第二阶段的原因
Which is why you should be focusing on Phase 2.

290
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:54,968
它正是为了应对这种…
It was designed for exactly this...

291
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,356
二阶段尚未完成，敌人已大军压境
Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.

292
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,152
我们需要应急反应部队
We need a response team.

293
00:20:00,362 --> 00:20:02,650
复仇者联盟计划早已停止
The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

294
00:20:02,865 --> 00:20:04,655
我不是说复仇者联盟
This isn't about the Avengers.

295
00:20:04,867 --> 00:20:05,980
我看过那份名单
We've seen the list.

296
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:08,407
你拥有世界上最精锐的特工组织
You're running the world's greatest covert security network

297
00:20:08,537 --> 00:20:10,160
却还要把人类的命运
and you're going to leave the fate of the human race

298
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,574
置于那群怪胎手中
to a handful of freaks.

299
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:13,615
人类的命运不会被握在任何人手中
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

300
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:16,039
我们确实需要应急反应部队
We need a response team.

301
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:18,999
他们也许性情孤僻，互有不合
These people may be isolated, unbalanced even

302
00:20:19,214 --> 00:20:23,377
但只要引导得当，他们正是我们现在最急需的
but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need.

303
00:20:23,677 --> 00:20:24,957
你确定？
You believe?

304
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:28,760
感情用事是赢不了战争的，局长
War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

305
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:32,807
当然，是士兵拼下来的
No, it's won by soldiers.

306
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,658


307
00:20:52,456 --> 00:20:54,246
时间不够了
There's not enough time.

308
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,999
我得让它落入海里
I got to put her in the water!

309
00:21:01,381 --> 00:21:02,412
你不是一个人在战斗
You won't be alone.

310
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:04,501
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

311
00:21:04,968 --> 00:21:06,130
这家伙竟然还活着！
This guy is still alive!

312
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,104


313
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:32,653
失眠了？
Trouble sleeping?

314
00:21:33,997 --> 00:21:36,666
我都睡了70年了，长官,早睡够了
I slept for 70 years, sir. I think I've had my fill.

315
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,123
那你应该出门庆祝一下，四处看看
Then you should be out,celebrating, seeing the world.

316
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,804
我被冰封期间，世界正处在战乱中
When I went under, the world was at war.

317
00:21:51,014 --> 00:21:52,840
等我醒来，他们说我们赢了
I wake up, they say we won.

318
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,100
却对我们的损失绝口不提
They didn't say what we lost.

319
00:21:55,686 --> 00:21:58,010
我们一路上也犯了不少错误
We've made some mistakes along the way.

320
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:00,098
最近就有一些
Some, very recently.

321
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,847
你是带着任务来的吗，长官？
Are you here with a mission, sir?

322
00:22:02,985 --> 00:22:03,980
是的
I am.

323
00:22:04,111 --> 00:22:05,770
想把我融入外面的世界？
Trying to get me back in the world?

324
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,939
想让你拯救外面的世界
Trying to save it.

325
00:22:12,618 --> 00:22:14,610
海德拉的秘密武器
HYDRA'S secret weapon.

326
00:22:13,184 --> 00:22:14,703


327
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:16,904
这是史塔在找你的时候
Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean

328
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,153
从海里捞上来的
when he was looking for you.

329
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,367
他和我们观点相同
He thought what we think.

330
00:22:20,626 --> 00:22:24,753
宇宙立方是人类开发利用永续能源的关键
The Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy.

331
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:29,045
这正是世界所需要的
That's something the world sorely needs.

332
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:31,715
谁把它夺走了？
Who took it from you?

333
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:33,339
洛基
He's called Loki.

334
00:22:33,556 --> 00:22:36,176
他远道而来
He's not from around here.

335
00:22:36,642 --> 00:22:40,050
如果你加入我们，还得给你补补课
There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in.

336
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,019
不是你不明白
The world has gotten even stranger

337
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:44,227
这世界变化快
than you already know.

338
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:47,306
我现在早见怪不怪了
At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me.

339
00:22:47,945 --> 00:22:49,604
你错了，我赌10美元
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

340
00:22:51,365 --> 00:22:55,238
任务报告放在你的公寓了
There's a debriefing packet waiting for you back at your apartment.

341
00:22:57,622 --> 00:22:59,530
关于宇宙立方的情况
Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract

342
00:22:59,665 --> 00:23:00,862
你有什么能告诉我们的吗？
that we ought to know now?

343
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:03,455
你们就不该把它捞出来
You should have left it in the ocean.

344
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:05,927


345
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:15,353


346
00:23:36,202 --> 00:23:39,072
我这边搞定了，剩下的就看你了
Good to go on this end. The rest is up to you.

347
00:23:39,288 --> 00:23:40,616
断开与输电线的连接了吗？
You disconnected the transmission lines?

348
00:23:40,748 --> 00:23:41,743
我们脱离了供电网络？
Are we off the grid?

349
00:23:41,874 --> 00:23:45,668
史塔大厦将成为能源自给的标志性建筑
Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy.

350
00:23:45,795 --> 00:23:49,161
前提是弦反应堆能够替代电网正常供电
Well, assuming the arc reactor takes over and it actually works.

351
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:50,828
没问题的
I assume.

352
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:52,337
点亮吧
Light her up.

353
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:59,843


354
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:58,885
看起来如何？
How does it look?

355
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:01,726
像圣诞节一样，但更有我的特色
Like Christmas, but with more me.

356
00:24:01,936 --> 00:24:03,678
我们得在普及公众意识上更进一步才行
We've got to go wider on the public awareness campaign.

357
00:24:03,896 --> 00:24:04,927
你得在传媒上多造势
You need to do some press.

358
00:24:05,565 --> 00:24:06,559
我明天就去华盛顿
I'm in DC tomorrow,

359
00:24:06,732 --> 00:24:08,226
为接下来三座大厦选址
I'm working on the zoning for the next three buildings.

360
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:10,606
小辣椒，别扫兴，我们期待这一刻已久
Pepper, you're killing me. The moment, remember?

361
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,850
尽情享受现在吧
Enjoy the moment.

362
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:13,233
进来我们一块享受吧
Get in here and I will.

363
00:24:16,576 --> 00:24:19,492
先生，神盾局的古逊探员来电
Sir, Agent Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D. is on the line.

364
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,074
说我在外面
I'm not in.

365
00:24:21,748 --> 00:24:23,027
我也的确在外面
I'm actually out.

366
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,510


367
00:24:30,256 --> 00:24:32,876
先生，他坚持要找你
Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

368
00:24:33,092 --> 00:24:35,843
长点骨气，佐维斯，我约会呢
Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.

369
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:43,344
能级保持稳定
Levels are holding steady, I think.

370
00:24:43,561 --> 00:24:45,718
那还用说，我亲自参与的
Of course they are. I was directly involved.

371
00:24:45,938 --> 00:24:47,100
这让我不得不考虑一个问题
Which brings me to my next question.

372
00:24:47,273 --> 00:24:49,229
当个天才感觉如何？
How does it feel to be a genius?

373
00:24:49,441 --> 00:24:51,682
看来我这辈子肯定没机会考虑这个问题了
Well, I really wouldn't know, now would I?

374
00:24:51,902 --> 00:24:56,397
别这样说，你可是我灵感的源泉
What do you mean? All this came from you.

375
00:24:56,615 --> 00:25:00,232
不，这才是一切的源泉
No, all this came from that.

376
00:25:00,452 --> 00:25:02,740
别太谦虚
Give yourself some credit. Please.

377
00:25:02,954 --> 00:25:04,745
史塔大厦就像你的孩子一样
Stark Tower is your baby.

378
00:25:04,956 --> 00:25:07,328
你有12%的功劳
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

379
00:25:07,793 --> 00:25:08,906
12%？
12%?

380
00:25:09,044 --> 00:25:10,157
15%，不能再多了
An argument can be made for 15.

381
00:25:10,295 --> 00:25:11,872
就12%还叫「我的孩子」？
12%? My baby?

382
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:13,665
毕竟所有的重活都是我干的
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

383
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,671
准确地说，重物都是我搬的
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

384
00:25:15,926 --> 00:25:18,167
对了，说说混乱的安保系统
And, sorry, but the security snafu?

385
00:25:18,303 --> 00:25:19,761
都怪你
- That was on you. - Oh.

386
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,005
- 我的私人电梯 - 你是说我们的电梯？
- My private elevator... - You mean our elevator?

387
00:25:22,224 --> 00:25:24,892
挤满了浑身臭汗的工人
...It was teeming with sweaty workmen.

388
00:25:25,102 --> 00:25:29,602
我会为刚才分功的评论付出代价的，对吧？
I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I?

389
00:25:30,065 --> 00:25:31,262
可没那么简单
It's not going to be that subtle.

390
00:25:31,483 --> 00:25:32,762
这么说吧
I'll tell you what.

391
00:25:32,984 --> 00:25:35,439
下一座大厦上将挂上「宝芝」的大名
The next building is gonna say "Potts" on the tower.

392
00:25:35,654 --> 00:25:37,028
还是写租约上吧
On the lease.

393
00:25:37,948 --> 00:25:40,070
打电话问你妈你能不能留下过夜
Call your mom. Can you bunk over?

394
00:25:40,283 --> 00:25:41,527
先生，您的电话
Sir, the telephone.

395
00:25:41,743 --> 00:25:44,114
我的规程被改写了
I'm afraid my protocols are being overridden.

396
00:25:44,329 --> 00:25:46,285
史塔先生，我有事找你
Mr. Stark, we need to talk.

397
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:48,906
你正在与东尼·史塔的仿生假体通话
You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark.

398
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:51,123
- 请留言 - 我有急事
- Please leave a message. - This is urgent.

399
00:25:51,336 --> 00:25:53,126
那就快点说
Then leave it urgently.

400
00:25:54,673 --> 00:25:55,786
安保漏洞，你的错
Security breach. It's on you.

401
00:25:56,007 --> 00:25:58,711
- 史塔先生 - 费尔，快请进
- Mr. Stark. - Phil! Come in.

402
00:25:58,885 --> 00:25:59,880
「费尔」？
"Phil"?

403
00:26:00,011 --> 00:26:01,042
我不能久留
I can't stay.

404
00:26:01,263 --> 00:26:02,460
他名叫「探员」
His first name is "Agent."

405
00:26:02,681 --> 00:26:04,304
快请进，我们正在庆祝
Come on in. We're celebrating.

406
00:26:04,516 --> 00:26:06,306
正因此他不能久留
Which is why he can't stay.

407
00:26:06,518 --> 00:26:08,474
请尽快阅读这些资料
We need you to look this over as soon as possible.

408
00:26:08,687 --> 00:26:09,717
我不喜欢别人递给我东西
I don't like being handed things.

409
00:26:09,938 --> 00:26:11,396
没事，我喜欢别人递给我东西
That's fine, because I love to be handed things.

410
00:26:11,606 --> 00:26:12,934
我们换一换
So, let's trade.

411
00:26:14,317 --> 00:26:15,811
谢谢你
Thank you.

412
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:20,359
正式咨询时间是每隔一周的 周四的早8点到下午5点
Official consulting hours are between 8 and 5 every other Thursday.

413
00:26:20,532 --> 00:26:21,527
我不是来咨询的
This isn't a consultation.

414
00:26:21,658 --> 00:26:22,902
是关于复仇者联盟？
Is this about the Avengers?

415
00:26:23,326 --> 00:26:25,152
我对此一无所知
Which I know nothing about.

416
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,907
我记得复仇者联盟计划早已废弃
The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought.

417
00:26:28,123 --> 00:26:29,497
我连入选资格都没有
And I didn't even qualify.

418
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:30,703
我也不大清楚
I didn't know that either.

419
00:26:30,876 --> 00:26:33,745
何况我反复无常，偏执自恋
Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed,

420
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:35,123
和他人难以相处
don't play well with others.

421
00:26:35,422 --> 00:26:36,417
这个我深有感触
That I did know.

422
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:38,172
现在没空管性格了
This isn't about personality profiles anymore.

423
00:26:38,341 --> 00:26:40,666
无所谓了，宝芝小姐，可以过来下吗？
Whatever. Ms. Potts, got a second?

424
00:26:40,886 --> 00:26:41,880
稍等
Half a mo.

425
00:26:47,184 --> 00:26:49,508
我还以为我们能共度良宵哪
You know, I thought we were having a moment.

426
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,304
我正在享受那12%的良宵
I was having 12% of a moment.

427
00:26:52,522 --> 00:26:54,977
事态看来挺严重的，费尔惊魂未定
This seems serious. Phil's pretty shaken.

428
00:26:55,192 --> 00:26:57,148
你知道那是…你怎么叫他费尔？
How would you know if it's... Why is he "Phil"?

429
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,103
这都是些什么？
What is all this?

430
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:00,862
这些是
This is

431
00:27:01,573 --> 00:27:02,568
看吧
this.

432
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:04,457


433
00:27:09,915 --> 00:27:11,289
我今晚就飞华盛顿
I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.

434
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:12,446
明天吧
Tomorrow.

435
00:27:12,584 --> 00:27:14,872
你资料要看，还不少呢
You have homework. You have a lot of homework.

436
00:27:15,087 --> 00:27:16,793
要是我不看呢？
Well, what if I didn't?

437
00:27:17,422 --> 00:27:18,797
- 你不看？- 是啊
- If you didn't? - Yeah.

438
00:27:19,007 --> 00:27:21,165
你是说你已经看完了？
You mean when you've finished?

439
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,545
那好吧
Well, then...

440
00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:32,048
就这么定了，一路顺风
Square deal. Fly safe.

441
00:27:36,273 --> 00:27:37,387
好好干
Work hard.

442
00:27:40,277 --> 00:27:42,020
去拉瓜迪亚机场顺路吗？
So, any chance you're driving by LaGuardia?

443
00:27:42,238 --> 00:27:44,988
- 我载你去吧 - 太棒了
- I can drop you. - Fantastic.

444
00:27:45,116 --> 00:27:46,110
说说那个大提琴手吧
I want to hear

445
00:27:46,242 --> 00:27:47,901
你们还有戏吗？
about the cellist. Is that still a thing?

446
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,232
她搬回波特兰了
She moved back to Portland.

447
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:52,572
真的吗？
What? BOO!

448
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:03,038
我们距基地还有40分钟航程，长官
We're about 40 minutes out from home base, sir.

449
00:28:06,762 --> 00:28:10,426
班纳博士想复制我曾注射的血清吗？
So, this Dr. Banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me?

450
00:28:10,641 --> 00:28:12,182
很多人都想
A lot of people were.

451
00:28:12,393 --> 00:28:14,016
你是世界上第一个超级英雄
You were the world's first superhero.

452
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:17,432
班纳认为破解艾斯金的原始配方的关键
Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking

453
00:28:17,606 --> 00:28:18,934
就在于伽玛射线
Erskine's original formula.

454
00:28:19,984 --> 00:28:21,358
只可惜事与愿违，不是吗？
Didn't really go his way, did it?

455
00:28:21,777 --> 00:28:23,235
差不多吧
Not so much.

456
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:26,280
不过他不变身的时候就像史蒂芬·霍金一样
When he's not that thing, though, the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

457
00:28:28,325 --> 00:28:30,862
我是指智力方面
He's like a smart person.

458
00:28:32,997 --> 00:28:34,110
说实话
I gotta say,

459
00:28:34,457 --> 00:28:36,863
十分荣幸能与你正式会面
it's an honour to meet you officially.

460
00:28:37,626 --> 00:28:39,120
我是，我以前也算见过你
I've sort of met you. I mean,

461
00:28:39,295 --> 00:28:41,085
是你还在沉睡的时候
I watched you while you were sleeping.

462
00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:45,129
你被发现冰封不醒时
I mean, I was present

463
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:48,627
我就在场
while you were unconscious from the ice.

464
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:51,134
你能加入我们
You know, it's really just a huge honour

465
00:28:51,265 --> 00:28:53,221
实在是太荣幸了
to have you on board this...

466
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:55,473
希望我可以胜任吧
I hope I'm the man for the job.

467
00:28:55,686 --> 00:28:58,556
你当然可以，绝对的
Oh, you are. Absolutely.

468
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:01,642
我们对你的战斗服做了些改动
We made some modifications to the uniform.

469
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:03,352
还采纳了些我的意见
I had a little design input.

470
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:04,813
战斗服？
The uniform?

471
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:07,519
那些星条旗图案…
Aren't the stars and stripes a little

472
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:10,027
是不是有些过时？
old-fashioned?

473
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:13,025
鉴于目前局势
With everything that's happening

474
00:29:13,245 --> 00:29:14,869
和未来可能发生的事情
and the things that are about to come to light,

475
00:29:15,748 --> 00:29:19,198
人们可能需要一些过去的美国精神
people might just need a little old-fashioned.

476
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:39,154


477
00:29:51,742 --> 00:29:54,695
智塔利人已经等不及了
The Chitauri grow restless.

478
00:29:54,912 --> 00:29:56,619
让他们做好战备吧
Let them gird themselves.

479
00:29:56,747 --> 00:29:58,538
我将引领他们打一场光荣的战役
I will lead them in the glorious battle.

480
00:29:58,749 --> 00:29:59,911
战役？
Battle?

481
00:30:00,751 --> 00:30:03,835
对付那些弱小的地球人？
Against the meagre might of Earth?

482
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:06,880
一场光荣的闪电战
Glorious, not lengthy.

483
00:30:07,091 --> 00:30:10,874
只要你的大军如你所言般强大
If your force is as formidable as you claim.

484
00:30:11,095 --> 00:30:13,585
你竟然质疑我们？
You question us?

485
00:30:13,806 --> 00:30:15,928
你质疑的人
You question him,

486
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:18,553
正是在你战败且遭受流放时
he who put the sceptre in your hand?

487
00:30:18,768 --> 00:30:21,685
授予你权杖
Who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose

488
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:24,766
并给予你远古知识与新的目标的人
when you were cast out, defeated?

489
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:26,855
我是国王
I was a king!

490
00:30:27,068 --> 00:30:29,274
亚斯加特的法定国王
The rightful king of Asgard,

491
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:30,774
可惜遭人背叛
betrayed.

492
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:34,068
你鼠目寸光
Your ambition is little

493
00:30:34,284 --> 00:30:37,034
满是幼稚之想
and born of childish need.

494
00:30:37,245 --> 00:30:39,237
我们放眼地球之外
We look beyond the Earth

495
00:30:39,456 --> 00:30:42,409
那些即将被宇宙立方开启的无垠星空
to the greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil.

496
00:30:42,876 --> 00:30:44,285
可惜宇宙立方还在我手上
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

497
00:30:47,088 --> 00:30:48,083
我可没有威胁你
I don't threaten.

498
00:30:49,632 --> 00:30:52,205
但只要传送门没有打开
But until I open the doors,

499
00:30:52,427 --> 00:30:56,044
你的大军没有归于我的麾下
until your force is mine to command,

500
00:30:56,806 --> 00:30:58,597
你的一切都只是空谈
you are but words.

501
00:30:58,808 --> 00:31:02,757
你会得到想要的战争的，亚斯加特人
You will have your war, Asgardian.

502
00:31:04,564 --> 00:31:06,556
如果你失败了
If you fail,

503
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:11,943
宇宙立方落入他人之手
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

504
00:31:12,155 --> 00:31:16,531
那将没有任何国家，任何星球
there will be no realm, no barren moon,

505
00:31:16,743 --> 00:31:20,027
哪怕一道裂隙供你躲藏
no crevice where he cannot find you.

506
00:31:21,623 --> 00:31:24,373
你知道苦痛的滋味吗？
You think you know pain?

507
00:31:24,584 --> 00:31:30,253
他会让你体验真正的痛不欲生
He will make you long for something sweet as pain.

508
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:31,641


509
00:31:59,452 --> 00:32:00,482
把美国队长的装备卸载下来
Stow the captain's gear.

510
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,615
遵命，长官
Yes, sir.

511
00:32:03,164 --> 00:32:06,283
罗曼诺夫探员，这位是罗杰斯队长
Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.

512
00:32:06,501 --> 00:32:07,780
- 你好，女士 - 你好
- Ma'am. - Hi.

513
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:08,956
他们在舰桥等着你
They need you on the bridge.

514
00:32:09,087 --> 00:32:10,580
他们开始面部识别追踪了
They're starting the face-trace.

515
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:11,875
回见
See you there.

516
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:17,760
你在冰中被发现可轰动一时呢
It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice.

517
00:32:18,054 --> 00:32:20,627
我以为古逊会乐晕了呢
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

518
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:23,718
他没让你在美国队长集换卡上签名？
Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?

519
00:32:23,935 --> 00:32:25,132
集换卡？
Trading cards?

520
00:32:25,353 --> 00:32:27,511
珍藏版的，他可引以为傲呢
They're vintage. He's very proud.

521
00:32:29,274 --> 00:32:30,553
班纳博士
Dr. Banner.

522
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:33,848
你好啊
Yeah, hi.

523
00:32:34,404 --> 00:32:35,601
我听说你会过来
They told me you would be coming.

524
00:32:35,822 --> 00:32:37,101
他们说你能找到那立方
Word is, you can find the Cube.

525
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:40,030
就说了这些？
Is that the only word on me?

526
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:41,613
我就关心这些
Only word I care about.

527
00:32:44,205 --> 00:32:46,790
这些一定让你倍感陌生吧
It must be strange for you, all of this.

528
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,169
其实，我倒觉得似曾相识
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

529
00:32:50,378 --> 00:32:52,951
先生们，你们最好赶紧进去
Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute.

530
00:32:53,173 --> 00:32:55,923
这儿马上就难以呼吸了
It's going to get a little hard to breathe.

531
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:58,717
空勤人员，请清空甲板
Flight crew, secure the deck.

532
00:33:03,223 --> 00:33:04,800
这是潜艇吗？
Is this a submarine?

533
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,345
真的？
Really?

534
00:33:06,477 --> 00:33:10,224
想把我关在水下加压的金属管子里？
They want me in a submerged, pressurised, metal container?

535
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:30,593


536
00:33:36,632 --> 00:33:39,003
不，好像更糟
No, no, this is much worse.

537
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:59,414


538
00:34:08,831 --> 00:34:11,534
悬停能量检查完毕，供给稳定
Hover power check complete. Position cyclic.

539
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,157
动力增至8%
Increase collective to 8.0%.

540
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:21,545
准备全速启航
Preparing for maximum performance takeoff.

541
00:34:21,677 --> 00:34:23,170
输出功率调至最高
Increase output to capacity.

542
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:25,467
动力性能已达上限
Power plant performing at capacity.

543
00:34:25,681 --> 00:34:27,139
准备完毕
We are clear.

544
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:28,842
全部引擎运转正常
All engines operating.

545
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:33,685
神盾局193.6号应急规程已启动
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency Protocol 193.6 in effect.

546
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:36,476
- 已到达预定高度，长官 - 很好
- We are at level, sir. - Good.

547
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:37,853
我们消失吧
Let's vanish.

548
00:34:38,068 --> 00:34:40,475
开启光线反射板
Engage retro-reflection panels.

549
00:34:56,253 --> 00:34:57,415
光线反射板开启完毕
Reflection panels engaged.

550
00:34:58,046 --> 00:34:59,421
先生们
Gentlemen.

551
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:12,882
感谢你的到来，博士
Doctor, thank you for coming.

552
00:35:14,897 --> 00:35:16,769
多谢你的善意邀请
Thanks for asking nicely.

553
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:19,602
那我要在这呆多久？
So, how long am I staying?

554
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:21,609
等我们拿到宇宙立方
Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,

555
00:35:21,737 --> 00:35:22,934
你就可以走了
you're in the wind.

556
00:35:23,071 --> 00:35:24,897
你那边有何进展？
Where are you with that?

557
00:35:25,115 --> 00:35:26,858
我们在扫描地球上每一个
We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible

558
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:27,987
连接到无线网络的摄像头
camera on the planet.

559
00:35:28,577 --> 00:35:30,367
手机，笔记本电脑…
Cell phones, laptops...

560
00:35:30,913 --> 00:35:34,197
只要它连上了卫星，就成了我们的眼线
If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us.

561
00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:35,660
这样还是无法及时找到他们
That's still not gonna find them in time.

562
00:35:35,876 --> 00:35:36,871
你得缩小搜寻范围
You have to narrow your field.

563
00:35:37,086 --> 00:35:39,042
你们有多少光谱仪可用？
How many spectrometers do you have access to?

564
00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:40,877
- 你要多少？ - 通知所有可以联系上的实验室
- How many are there? - Call every lab you know.

565
00:35:41,089 --> 00:35:42,795
让他们把光谱仪放在房顶
Tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof

566
00:35:42,924 --> 00:35:44,381
调整成接收伽玛射线的状态
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

567
00:35:44,592 --> 00:35:47,794
我会草拟一个聚类识别的追踪算法
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition.

568
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,502
最少能排除一些区域
At least we could rule out a few places.

569
00:35:50,765 --> 00:35:52,555
能给我找个干活的地方吗？
Do you have somewhere for me to work?

570
00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:53,922
罗曼诺夫探员
Agent Romanoff,

571
00:35:54,102 --> 00:35:56,342
能把班纳博士带到他的实验室去吗？
could you show Dr. Banner to his laboratory, please?

572
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,721
你会喜欢的，博士，那儿应有尽有
You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.

573
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:02,065
放那边去
Put it over there.

574
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,913


575
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,192
你从哪找的这些人？
Where did you find all these people?

576
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:09,358
神盾局树敌无数，博士
S.H.I.E.L.D. has no shortage of enemies, Doctor.

577
00:36:09,826 --> 00:36:10,904
这是你需要的材料吗？
Is this the stuff you need?

578
00:36:11,077 --> 00:36:12,072
是啊，铱
Yeah, iridium.

579
00:36:12,245 --> 00:36:14,865
陨石里找的，它可以产生反质子
It's found in meteorites. It forms anti-protons.

580
00:36:15,081 --> 00:36:16,704
这东西很难搞到
It's very hard to get hold of.

581
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:18,457
如果神盾局知道你需要它，就更难了
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D. knows you need it.

582
00:36:18,668 --> 00:36:20,042
这我就不知道了
Well, I didn't know.

583
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,430
Hey!

584
00:36:21,671 --> 00:36:23,959
宇宙立方向我展现了太多
The Tesseract has shown me so much.

585
00:36:24,424 --> 00:36:26,332
不止是知识，更是真理
It's more than knowledge. It's truth.

586
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:27,462
我知道
I know.

587
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:30,211
你看到了什么，巴顿探员？
What did it show you, Agent Barton?

588
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,590
我的下一个目标
My next target.

589
00:36:32,765 --> 00:36:33,760
告诉我你需要些什么
Tell me what you need.

590
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,096
引开他们的注意力
I need a distraction.

591
00:36:40,022 --> 00:36:41,432
和能通过视网膜扫描的眼球
And an eyeball.

592
00:36:48,197 --> 00:36:50,734
如果…不是太麻烦的话
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

593
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,980
没事，不麻烦
No, no. It's fine.

594
00:36:55,037 --> 00:36:56,614
那是套珍藏版
It's a vintage set.

595
00:36:56,831 --> 00:36:59,119
花了我好几年才收集齐
It took me a couple of years to collect them all.

596
00:37:01,669 --> 00:37:02,747
全新的
Near mint.

597
00:37:02,962 --> 00:37:04,336
边角有些泛黄，不过…
Slight foxing around the edges, but...

598
00:37:04,547 --> 00:37:07,167
发现疑似目标，吻合度67%
We got a hit. A 67% match.

599
00:37:07,675 --> 00:37:09,299
等等，交叉匹配，吻合度79%
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

600
00:37:10,303 --> 00:37:11,298
位置在哪？
Location?

601
00:37:11,471 --> 00:37:14,506
德国斯图加特国王大街28号
Stuttgart, Germany. 28 Königstrasse.

602
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:15,968
他就没打算躲起来
He's not exactly hiding.

603
00:37:16,184 --> 00:37:17,297
队长
Captain,

604
00:37:17,643 --> 00:37:18,638
看你的了
you're up.

605
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:30,791


606
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,085


607
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:00,738


608
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,933


609
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,400


610
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:44,365


611
00:38:58,045 --> 00:38:59,171


612
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:01,757


613
00:39:08,068 --> 00:39:10,597
（视网膜扫瞄… 通过认证 解锁）

614
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,862


615
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:44,383


616
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:46,135


617
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:53,267


618
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:55,288
给我跪下
Kneel before me.

619
00:39:59,763 --> 00:40:01,042
我说了
I said

620
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,651


621
00:40:03,141 --> 00:40:05,299
跪下！
kneel!

622
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:17,979
早这样不就好了？
Is not this simpler?

623
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:22,735
这不正是你们的本性？
Is this not your natural state?

624
00:40:25,038 --> 00:40:28,240
这是关于人性无人道破的真理
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

625
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:30,829
渴望被奴役
that you crave subjugation.

626
00:40:31,378 --> 00:40:35,161
自由那看似光鲜的诱惑吞噬了生活的乐趣
The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy

627
00:40:35,382 --> 00:40:37,954
热衷于追求权力
in a mad scramble for power,

628
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:41,177
沉溺于渴望认同
for identity.

629
00:40:42,848 --> 00:40:46,180
你们生来就该被奴役
You were made to be ruled.

630
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,433
到头来
In the end,

631
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:50,975
你们还是会臣服
you will always kneel.

632
00:40:58,363 --> 00:41:00,319
不会向你这种人臣服的
Not to men like you.

633
00:41:01,366 --> 00:41:03,274
你再也找不出第二个我了
There are no men like me.

634
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,029
你这种人多了
There are always men like you.

635
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,156
看看这老家伙
Look to your elder, people.

636
00:41:12,376 --> 00:41:13,786
就让他做你们的反面教材吧
Let him be an example.

637
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:16,559


638
00:41:20,593 --> 00:41:23,165
你看，上次我来德国
You know, the last time I was in Germany,

639
00:41:23,387 --> 00:41:26,553
就有一个人凌驾于众人之上
and saw a man standing above everybody else,

640
00:41:26,766 --> 00:41:28,223
我们就不欢而散
we ended up disagreeing.

641
00:41:28,434 --> 00:41:30,390
美国大兵
The soldier.

642
00:41:32,438 --> 00:41:33,682
过时的家伙
The man out of time.

643
00:41:34,273 --> 00:41:35,517
至少我不是快要死的那个
I'm not the one who's out of time.

644
00:41:39,028 --> 00:41:41,565
洛基，放下武器，立即投降
Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.

645
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:43,460


646
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:48,340


647
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:55,973


648
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:58,100


649
00:42:01,926 --> 00:42:03,502
跪下
Kneel.

650
00:42:03,636 --> 00:42:05,046
不可能
- Not today!

651
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:08,419
他的分身到处都是
The guy's all over the place.

652
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:10,362


653
00:42:11,936 --> 00:42:14,260
罗曼诺夫探员，想我了没？
Agent Romanoff. You miss me?

654
00:42:14,737 --> 00:42:15,416
（系统被改写）

655
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:24,919


656
00:42:30,996 --> 00:42:33,071
出招吧，小驯鹿
Make your move, Reindeer Games.

657
00:42:41,132 --> 00:42:42,589
这才乖
Good move.

658
00:42:44,093 --> 00:42:45,372
史塔先生
Mr. Stark.

659
00:42:46,053 --> 00:42:47,215
队长
Captain.

660
00:42:54,437 --> 00:42:56,060
他说什么了吗？
Is he saying anything?

661
00:42:56,272 --> 00:42:57,516
什么都不说
Not a word.

662
00:42:57,815 --> 00:42:59,723
把他带回来，我们时间不多了
Just get him here. We're low on time.

663
00:43:02,778 --> 00:43:03,773
有些不对劲
I don't like it.

664
00:43:04,155 --> 00:43:06,111
怎么，因为邪神大人如此轻易的投降？
What, Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

665
00:43:06,323 --> 00:43:07,982
我觉得没那么简单
I don't remember it being that easy.

666
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,616
这家伙挺厉害的
This guy packs a wallop.

667
00:43:09,827 --> 00:43:13,409
不过你那么大年纪功夫也挺不错的
Still, you are pretty spry for an older fellow.

668
00:43:14,457 --> 00:43:16,033
保持健康的秘诀是什么，做普拉提？
What's your thing, Pilates?

669
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:17,203
什么？
What?

670
00:43:17,376 --> 00:43:18,371
和健美操差不多
It's like calisthenics.

671
00:43:18,502 --> 00:43:20,541
你在当冰棍队长的时候
You might have missed a couple of things

672
00:43:20,755 --> 00:43:22,378
错过了很多事情
doing time as a Capsicle.

673
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,876
霍利没说他也叫你了
Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.

674
00:43:26,093 --> 00:43:28,963
是啊，霍利没说的事多了
Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.

675
00:43:29,346 --> 00:43:30,923
怎么打雷了？
Where's this coming from?

676
00:43:35,019 --> 00:43:37,591
怎么了？你还怕打雷？
What's the matter? Are you scared of a little lightning?

677
00:43:38,022 --> 00:43:40,310
我只是不喜欢随之而来的家伙
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

678
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:57,761


679
00:43:58,124 --> 00:43:59,286
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

680
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:04,393


681
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:12,234


682
00:44:12,222 --> 00:44:13,679
半路杀出了这家伙
And now there's that guy.

683
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:15,632
又一个亚斯加特人？
Another Asgardian?

684
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:17,676
- 他是自己人吗？ - 这无关紧要
- That guy's a friendly? - Doesn't matter.

685
00:44:17,894 --> 00:44:20,466
无论他杀了洛基或是放了他宇宙立方就找不到了
If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost.

686
00:44:20,688 --> 00:44:22,514
史塔，我们需要攻击计划
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

687
00:44:22,732 --> 00:44:25,020
我有个计划，攻击
I have a plan. Attack.

688
00:44:31,032 --> 00:44:32,823
要是我可不管这闲事，队长
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

689
00:44:33,034 --> 00:44:34,029
我可做不到
I don't see how I can.

690
00:44:34,244 --> 00:44:36,864
他们都是从神域而来基本上就是神
These guys come from legend. They're basically gods.

691
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:38,610
世上只有上帝一个神，女士
There's only one God, ma'am.

692
00:44:38,748 --> 00:44:41,119
而且他才不会打扮成那样
And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.

693
00:44:52,191 --> 00:44:53,734


694
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:56,236


695
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:57,974
宇宙立方在哪？
Where is the Tesseract?

696
00:44:58,184 --> 00:44:59,464
我也很想念你
I missed you, too.

697
00:44:59,686 --> 00:45:01,353
我像是跟你开玩笑的吗？
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

698
00:45:02,063 --> 00:45:03,437
你应该感谢我
You should thank me.

699
00:45:03,898 --> 00:45:05,937
彩虹桥已毁，奥丁汇聚了多少暗能
With the Bifrost gone, how much dark energy

700
00:45:06,151 --> 00:45:08,901
才把你传送到
did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here

701
00:45:09,112 --> 00:45:10,486
你心爱的地球上？
to your precious Earth?

702
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:12,169


703
00:45:14,617 --> 00:45:15,897
我还以为你死了
I thought you dead.

704
00:45:17,537 --> 00:45:18,947
你为我哀悼了？
Did you mourn?

705
00:45:19,414 --> 00:45:21,204
我们都哀悼了，我们的父王…
We all did. Our father...

706
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:24,457
你的父王
Your father.

707
00:45:26,337 --> 00:45:29,207
他把我的身世告诉你了，不是吗？
He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?

708
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,000
我们从小一块长大
We were raised together.

709
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,841
一起嬉戏，一同打闹
We played together, we fought together.

710
00:45:37,348 --> 00:45:38,546
你都不记得了吗？
Do you remember none of that?

711
00:45:38,767 --> 00:45:40,723
我只记得阴影
I remember a shadow.

712
00:45:42,228 --> 00:45:45,264
我活在你伟大所投射的阴影中
Living in the shade of your greatness.

713
00:45:45,982 --> 00:45:48,602
我无法忘记你把我扔下深渊
I remember you tossing me into an abyss.

714
00:45:48,735 --> 00:45:50,726
王位是我的，也应该由我来继承
I, who was, and should be, king!

715
00:45:50,945 --> 00:45:53,020
所以你践踏我心爱的世界
So you take the world I love as a recompense

716
00:45:53,156 --> 00:45:54,982
以补偿你所遭受的怠慢？
for your imagined slights?

717
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,283
不，地球在我的庇护之下，洛基
No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki.

718
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,591


719
00:45:59,704 --> 00:46:03,238
你保护得可真好啊
And you're doing a marvellous job with that.

720
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:05,664
人们成群结队地彼此厮杀
The humans slaughter each other in droves

721
00:46:05,794 --> 00:46:07,584
你却在一旁干着急
while you idly fret.

722
00:46:07,796 --> 00:46:09,953
我要统治他们，难道有错吗？
I mean to rule them, as why should I not?

723
00:46:10,173 --> 00:46:11,714
你自认高他们一等？
You think yourself above them?

724
00:46:12,801 --> 00:46:13,795
那当然
Well, yes.

725
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,465
那你就没懂得统治的真谛，弟弟
Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother.

726
00:46:17,305 --> 00:46:18,679
王位并不适合你
A throne would suit you ill.

727
00:46:23,895 --> 00:46:26,646
我见过许多你未知的世界
I've seen worlds you've never known about!

728
00:46:26,856 --> 00:46:31,019
奥丁逊，在流放途中，我已成长
I have grown, Odinson, in my exile.

729
00:46:31,401 --> 00:46:33,358
我见识了宇宙立方的真正力量
I have seen the true power of the Tesseract,

730
00:46:33,487 --> 00:46:34,565
等我拥有了它…
and when I wield it...

731
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,522
谁向你展示了它的力量？
Who showed you this power?

732
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:39,027
是谁在背后操纵着你这个国王迷？
Who controls the would-be king?

733
00:46:39,243 --> 00:46:41,033
- 我就是国王！- 别妄想了！
- I am a king! - Not here!

734
00:46:41,245 --> 00:46:42,524
交出宇宙立方！
You give up the Tesseract!

735
00:46:42,663 --> 00:46:45,200
放下痴心妄想！
You give up this poisonous dream!

736
00:46:47,918 --> 00:46:49,292
跟我回家
You come home.

737
00:46:54,258 --> 00:46:55,371
不在我手上
I don't have it.

738
00:46:57,469 --> 00:46:59,260
你需要立方来带我回去
You need the Cube to bring me home.

739
00:46:59,388 --> 00:47:01,712
但我把它转移了，我也不知道在哪
But I've sent it off, I know not where.

740
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:04,675
听好了，弟弟
You listen well, brother.

741
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,158


742
00:47:06,645 --> 00:47:07,842
我听着哪
I'm listening.

743
00:47:12,748 --> 00:47:13,916


744
00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:18,648
不许再碰我了
Do not touch me again.

745
00:47:18,866 --> 00:47:20,442
那你也别拿我东西
Then don't take my stuff.

746
00:47:20,659 --> 00:47:22,900
我看你是不知道厉害
You have no idea what you're dealing with.

747
00:47:24,788 --> 00:47:25,783
这是中央公园的莎翁戏剧节吗？
Shakespeare in the Park?

748
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:30,284
取帘为氅，令堂知否？
Doth Mother know you wear-eth her drapes?

749
00:47:30,544 --> 00:47:33,295
这不关你的事，铁皮人
This is beyond you, metal man.

750
00:47:33,505 --> 00:47:35,627
洛基将面临亚斯加特律法的审判
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

751
00:47:35,841 --> 00:47:39,209
让他把立方交出来，他就归你了在此之前
He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then,

752
00:47:39,595 --> 00:47:40,839
最好别碍事
stay out of the way.

753
00:47:42,389 --> 00:47:44,013
你个外域来客
- Tourist.

754
00:47:46,073 --> 00:47:47,282


755
00:47:49,396 --> 00:47:50,426
好吧
Okay.

756
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:02,422


757
00:48:09,263 --> 00:48:10,681


758
00:48:13,684 --> 00:48:14,685


759
00:48:17,688 --> 00:48:19,273


760
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:23,135
能量达到400%
Power at 400% capacity.

761
00:48:23,347 --> 00:48:24,888
尝尝这个
How about that?

762
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:33,495


763
00:48:46,341 --> 00:48:47,509


764
00:48:53,557 --> 00:48:56,643


765
00:48:57,936 --> 00:48:58,937


766
00:49:06,236 --> 00:49:07,237


767
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:14,077


768
00:49:15,704 --> 00:49:16,705


769
00:49:20,417 --> 00:49:21,418


770
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:26,214
Hey!

771
00:49:28,953 --> 00:49:30,150
够了没
That's enough.

772
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:35,748
我不知道你来此有何目的
Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.

773
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,248
我来这里终结洛基的阴谋
I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes.

774
00:49:38,463 --> 00:49:41,000
用行动说话，把锤子放下
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.

775
00:49:41,132 --> 00:49:42,127
啊…不行
Yeah... No.

776
00:49:42,383 --> 00:49:43,841
这可不是个好主意，他爱死他的锤子了
Bad call. He loves his hammer.

777
00:49:44,066 --> 00:49:45,067


778
00:49:45,428 --> 00:49:47,669
想让我放下锤子？
You want me to put the hammer down?

779
00:49:54,076 --> 00:49:55,661


780
00:50:02,918 --> 00:50:04,169


781
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:16,700
打够了没？
Are we done, here?

782
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:01,727


783
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:07,543
先跟你说清楚了
In case it's unclear,

784
00:51:08,261 --> 00:51:10,051
如果你想逃跑
if you try to escape,

785
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:13,426
哪怕轻轻挠那玻璃一下
if you so much as scratch that glass,

786
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:17,325


787
00:51:23,025 --> 00:51:26,974
你就会随着这监牢从万米高空坠落
it's 30,000 feet straight down in a steel trap.

788
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:29,652
懂了吗？
You get how that works?

789
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:34,321
你是蚂蚁，我是靴子
Ant, boot.

790
00:51:34,426 --> 00:51:36,511


791
00:51:37,665 --> 00:51:39,408
这笼子可真不错
It's an impressive cage.

792
00:51:40,334 --> 00:51:42,955
不过，不是为我建造的吧
Not built, I think, for me.

793
00:51:43,337 --> 00:51:45,744
它是为个比你强大得多的东西建的
Built for something a lot stronger than you.

794
00:51:45,965 --> 00:51:47,838
我有所耳闻
Oh, I've heard.

795
00:51:48,843 --> 00:51:50,005
一头愚蠢的野兽
A mindless beast.

796
00:51:51,012 --> 00:51:52,635
还假装自己是普通人
Makes play he's still a man.

797
00:51:53,722 --> 00:51:55,963
你该有多绝望
How desperate are you,

798
00:51:56,183 --> 00:51:59,266
才会找来这种怪胎作援兵？
that you call on such lost creatures to defend you?

799
00:51:59,478 --> 00:52:01,802
我有多绝望？
How desperate am I?

800
00:52:02,022 --> 00:52:03,812
你以战争威胁我们的世界
You threaten my world with war.

801
00:52:04,024 --> 00:52:06,146
你窃取自己无法掌控的能量
You steal a force you can't hope to control.

802
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:10,142
你嘴边挂着安宁，却以挥舞手中屠刀为乐
You talk about peace, and you kill because it's fun.

803
00:52:10,363 --> 00:52:13,363
你逼我孤注一掷
You have made me very desperate.

804
00:52:13,575 --> 00:52:15,483
你会为你的所作所为后悔的
You might not be glad that you did.

805
00:52:15,884 --> 00:52:17,177
噢
Ooh.

806
00:52:18,747 --> 00:52:22,031
功亏一篑让你无比痛苦吧
It burns you to have come so close.

807
00:52:23,502 --> 00:52:26,205
获取宇宙立方，拥有其中能量
To have the Tesseract, to have power,

808
00:52:27,005 --> 00:52:29,210
无尽的能量
unlimited power.

809
00:52:29,424 --> 00:52:31,380
用来干什么？
And for what?

810
00:52:33,762 --> 00:52:36,845
点起照亮人类前路的明灯
A warm light for all mankind to share.

811
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:40,348
然后认识到真正力量的本来面目
And then to be reminded what real power is.

812
00:52:44,439 --> 00:52:48,732
如果真正力量想要看杂志解闷，记得跟我说
Well, let me know if "real power" wants a magazine or something.

813
00:52:57,077 --> 00:52:58,535
你都看他看入迷了吧
He really grows on you, doesn't he?

814
00:52:58,745 --> 00:53:00,653
洛基是在拖延时间
Loki's gonna drag this out.

815
00:53:00,872 --> 00:53:04,323
托尔，他到底想干什么？
So, Thor, what's his play?

816
00:53:04,543 --> 00:53:07,080
他拥有一支智塔利大军
He has an army called the Chitauri.

817
00:53:07,295 --> 00:53:10,212
他们并非来自亚斯加特或任何已知的世界
They're not of Asgard, nor any world known.

818
00:53:10,632 --> 00:53:12,707
洛基想带领他们攻打地球
He means to lead them against your people.

819
00:53:12,926 --> 00:53:14,503
他们将助洛基夺取地球
They will win him the Earth,

820
00:53:14,636 --> 00:53:16,426
而我想洛基会将宇宙立方交给他们
in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

821
00:53:16,638 --> 00:53:18,380
来自外太空的
An army

822
00:53:18,598 --> 00:53:20,257
大军
from outer space.

823
00:53:20,475 --> 00:53:22,882
那么他正在建立另一个传送门
So, he's building another portal.

824
00:53:23,103 --> 00:53:24,430
这就是他带走艾力·绍韦的原因
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

825
00:53:24,563 --> 00:53:25,557
绍韦？
Selvig?

826
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:28,055
- 他是位天体物理学家 - 我的朋友
- He's an astrophysicist. - He's a friend.

827
00:53:28,275 --> 00:53:30,397
洛基用某种魔法控制了他
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

828
00:53:30,569 --> 00:53:32,062
还有我们的一位探员
along with one of ours.

829
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:33,855
洛基为何如此轻易的束手就擒
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

830
00:53:33,989 --> 00:53:35,268
他在这无法领导任何大军
He's not leading an army from here.

831
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:37,197
我觉得不应该把注意力集中在洛基身上
I don't think we should be focusing on Loki.

832
00:53:37,409 --> 00:53:39,199
他的想法难以捉摸
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

833
00:53:39,327 --> 00:53:40,607
可以说就是个疯子
You could smell crazy on him.

834
00:53:40,829 --> 00:53:42,571
说话注意点
Have care how you speak.

835
00:53:43,123 --> 00:53:45,328
尽管洛基蛮不讲理，但他还是亚斯加特人
Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard.

836
00:53:45,751 --> 00:53:46,829
也是我的弟弟
And he is my brother.

837
00:53:47,043 --> 00:53:48,916
他在两天内杀了80个人
He killed 80 people in two days.

838
00:53:49,796 --> 00:53:50,791
不是亲弟弟
He's adopted.

839
00:53:50,964 --> 00:53:53,252
让我们往机械上想想吧
I think it's about the mechanics.

840
00:53:53,467 --> 00:53:55,423
铱，他们要铱干什么？
Iridium... What do they need the iridium for?

841
00:53:55,635 --> 00:53:56,630
铱是一种稳定剂
It's a stabilising agent.

842
00:53:56,803 --> 00:53:58,083
我是说，随便那个周末
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

843
00:53:58,221 --> 00:53:59,762
我开飞机载你去波特兰
I'll fly you to Portland.

844
00:53:59,973 --> 00:54:01,514
多培养一下情感
Keep love alive.

845
00:54:01,725 --> 00:54:05,594
这样传送门就不会像神盾局的那个一样自我坍塌了
It means the portal won't collapse on itself like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

846
00:54:05,812 --> 00:54:09,097
不打不相识，你那一下真狠
No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing.

847
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:11,557
同时铱还可以让洛基根据需要
Also, it means the portal can open as wide

848
00:54:11,777 --> 00:54:14,183
把传送门开得更大，持续时间更长
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

849
00:54:14,905 --> 00:54:17,110
升起后桅，全速启航
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

850
00:54:18,825 --> 00:54:20,022
那人在玩「小蜜蜂」
That man is playing Galaga.

851
00:54:21,078 --> 00:54:24,446
他自以为别人看不到，但被我发现了
He thought we wouldn't notice, but we did.

852
00:54:26,416 --> 00:54:27,791
霍利的视线如何兼顾两侧？
How does Fury even see these?

853
00:54:27,959 --> 00:54:28,954
他会转身
He turns.

854
00:54:29,252 --> 00:54:30,876
那多累啊
Sounds exhausting.

855
00:54:31,963 --> 00:54:33,125
剩余的原材料
The rest of the raw materials,

856
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:36,126
巴顿探员都能轻松得到
Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.

857
00:54:36,342 --> 00:54:37,716
现在他只需要一个部件
The only major component he still needs

858
00:54:37,927 --> 00:54:41,425
高能量密度的动力源
is a power source of high-energy density.

859
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:44,888
来启动立方
Something to kick-start the Cube.

860
00:54:45,101 --> 00:54:48,054
你什么时候变成热核天体物理学家了？
When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?

861
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:49,265
昨天晚上
Last night.

862
00:54:49,772 --> 00:54:52,974
看看任务资料，绍韦的笔记和精选的理论论文
The packet, Selvig's notes, the extraction theory papers.

863
00:54:53,192 --> 00:54:54,187
难道只有我看了？
Am I the only one who did the reading?

864
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,146
洛基需要某种特定的能源吗？
Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?

865
00:54:57,363 --> 00:55:00,067
他得把立方加热到1.2亿开氏度
He would have to heat the Cube to 120-million Kelvin

866
00:55:00,282 --> 00:55:01,740
以突破库仑势垒
just to break through the Coulomb barrier.

867
00:55:01,951 --> 00:55:04,156
除非绍韦找到
Unless Selvig has figured out how to stabilise

868
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:05,483
稳定量子隧道效应的办法
the quantum tunneling effect.

869
00:55:05,704 --> 00:55:06,699
如果他真找到了
Well, if he could do that,

870
00:55:06,872 --> 00:55:09,327
就可以用地球上任一个反应堆完成重离子聚变
he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet.

871
00:55:09,542 --> 00:55:11,948
终于有会说人话的了
Finally, someone who speaks English.

872
00:55:12,169 --> 00:55:14,125
是那么回事吗？
Is that what just happened?

873
00:55:14,338 --> 00:55:16,330
很高兴见到你，班纳博士
It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.

874
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:19,584
你在反电子冲撞领域中的成就无人能及
Your work on antielectron collisions is unparalleled.

875
00:55:19,802 --> 00:55:21,592
我也是你失控时变成的
And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control

876
00:55:21,804 --> 00:55:23,842
那个绿色大怪兽的铁杆粉丝
and turn into an enormous green rage-monster.

877
00:55:25,391 --> 00:55:26,421
谢谢
Thanks.

878
00:55:26,642 --> 00:55:29,132
班纳博士只为追寻立方而来
Dr. Banner is only here to track the Cube.

879
00:55:29,353 --> 00:55:30,633
我希望你可以助他一臂之力
I was hoping you might join him.

880
00:55:30,855 --> 00:55:32,016
从他的权杖开始看吧
I would start with that stick of his.

881
00:55:32,148 --> 00:55:33,178
它也许有魔力
It may be magical,

882
00:55:33,315 --> 00:55:34,595
但用法和海德拉的武器挺像的
but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.

883
00:55:34,734 --> 00:55:37,769
我不大清楚，但它由立方所驱动
I don't know about that, but it is powered by the Cube.

884
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:39,813
我想知道洛基怎么用它
And I would like to know how Loki used it

885
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:41,607
把我见过的最机警的两个人
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

886
00:55:41,741 --> 00:55:43,531
变成他的跟班飞猴
into his personal flying monkeys.

887
00:55:43,909 --> 00:55:45,451
猴子？你在说什么
Monkeys? I do not understand.

888
00:55:45,578 --> 00:55:46,572
绿野仙踪，我知道
I do.

889
00:55:49,582 --> 00:55:51,454
我知道这典故
I understood that reference.

890
00:55:52,376 --> 00:55:53,704
我们开始吧，博士？
Shall we play, Doctor?

891
00:55:53,919 --> 00:55:55,626
这边请，先生
This way, sir.

892
00:56:09,602 --> 00:56:11,178
伽玛读数和绍韦报告上
The gamma readings are definitely consistent

893
00:56:11,395 --> 00:56:13,387
宇宙立方的读数完全一致
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

894
00:56:13,773 --> 00:56:15,396
但处理起来要花好几周时间
But it's going to take weeks to process.

895
00:56:15,608 --> 00:56:16,805
如果可以绕过他们的主机
If we bypass their mainframe

896
00:56:16,942 --> 00:56:18,222
连接到主群集
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

897
00:56:18,444 --> 00:56:21,527
我们可以做到每秒600兆次浮点运算
we can clock this at around 600 teraflops.

898
00:56:22,698 --> 00:56:24,654
可惜我只带了牙刷
All I packed was a toothbrush.

899
00:56:25,743 --> 00:56:27,319
有空来史塔大厦玩玩
You know, you should come by Stark Tower sometime.

900
00:56:27,536 --> 00:56:29,575
顶10层用作科研
Top ten floors, all R&D.

901
00:56:29,914 --> 00:56:31,371
包你喜欢
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

902
00:56:31,582 --> 00:56:34,072
谢了，上次我在纽约
Thanks, but the last time I was in New York,

903
00:56:34,293 --> 00:56:36,830
差点炸了哈莱姆区
I kind of broke Harlem.

904
00:56:37,046 --> 00:56:38,872
我保证这次你会毫无压力
Well, I promise a stress-free environment.

905
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:40,880
毫不紧张，绝无意外
No tension, no surprises.

906
00:56:40,899 --> 00:56:42,233
- Ow!

907
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:43,735
Hey! - Nothing?

908
00:56:44,095 --> 00:56:45,089
你疯了？
Are you nuts?

909
00:56:45,221 --> 00:56:46,215
天晓得
Jury's out.

910
00:56:46,347 --> 00:56:47,460
自制力不错啊
You really have got a lid on it, haven't you?

911
00:56:47,598 --> 00:56:48,593
有何秘诀？
What's your secret?

912
00:56:48,724 --> 00:56:50,182
玩爵士乐还是磕药？
Mellow jazz, bongo drums huge bag of weed?

913
00:56:50,351 --> 00:56:51,464
你很爱开玩笑吗？
Is everything a joke to you?

914
00:56:51,769 --> 00:56:52,764
好玩嘛
Funny things are.

915
00:56:52,895 --> 00:56:54,637
这会令大家身陷险境
Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship

916
00:56:54,772 --> 00:56:56,016
何来好玩
isn't funny.

917
00:56:56,148 --> 00:56:57,143
对不起，博士
No offence, Doc.

918
00:56:57,274 --> 00:56:58,768
没关系，若我连这小刺激都适应不了
It's all right, I wouldn't have come aboard

919
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:01,735
就不会登船了
if I couldn't handle pointy things.

920
00:57:01,862 --> 00:57:04,435
大块头，你太谨慎了，放松点
You're tip-toeing, big man. You need to strut.

921
00:57:04,573 --> 00:57:06,232
而你需要专注解决问题，史塔先生
And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark.

922
00:57:06,367 --> 00:57:07,860
难道我没有做事吗？
Do you think I'm not?

923
00:57:07,993 --> 00:57:10,780
为何霍利现在才召集我们？
Why did Fury call us in? Why now? Why not before?

924
00:57:10,913 --> 00:57:12,655
有何内幕？
What isn't he telling us?

925
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:14,532
消除所有疑惑，我才能做事
I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.

926
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:16,411
你指霍利有所隐瞒？
You think Fury's hiding something?

927
00:57:16,544 --> 00:57:19,709
毕竟他可是特务中的佼佼者
He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.

928
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:21,580
深不可测
His secrets have secrets.

929
00:57:21,714 --> 00:57:23,208
他也有同感吧？
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

930
00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:24,234
Uh...

931
00:57:25,802 --> 00:57:27,592
我只想完成我在这里的工作
I just want to finish my work here, and...

932
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:28,715
博士?
Doctor?

933
00:57:34,144 --> 00:57:36,515
点起照亮人类前程的明灯
"A warm light for all mankind."

934
00:57:36,646 --> 00:57:38,721
提及宇宙立方时，洛基这样对霍利说道
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

935
00:57:38,857 --> 00:57:40,314
我听见了
I heard it.

936
00:57:40,442 --> 00:57:42,729
是说给你听的
I think that was meant for you.

937
00:57:43,445 --> 00:57:46,398
即使巴顿没跟洛基提过史塔大厦
Even if Barton didn't tell Loki about the tower,

938
00:57:46,531 --> 00:57:47,609
他也可以由新闻得知
it was still all over the news.

939
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:49,816
史塔大厦？高耸又奇丑…
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly

940
00:57:51,161 --> 00:57:52,405
的纽约建筑大厦？
building in New York?

941
00:57:52,537 --> 00:57:56,237
由弦反应炉供能，能源可自生
It's powered by an arc reactor, a self-sustaining energy source.

942
00:57:56,374 --> 00:57:58,781
大厦能自给自足一年吗？
That building will run itself for, what, a year?

943
00:57:58,918 --> 00:58:00,744
只是个试点
It's just the prototype.

944
00:58:00,879 --> 00:58:02,835
我可是目前洁净能源的先驱者
I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.

945
00:58:03,256 --> 00:58:04,666
这就是他的目的
That's what he's getting at.

946
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:07,372
为何神盾局没招揽他加入宇宙立方计划？
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. bring him in on the Tesseract project?

947
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:10,715
当初为何他们会涉足能源产业？
What are they doing in the energy business in the first place?

948
00:58:10,847 --> 00:58:13,800
一旦我获悉所有神盾局的机密
I should probably look into that once my decryption program

949
00:58:13,933 --> 00:58:16,091
我会着手调查此事
finishes breaking into all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

950
00:58:16,227 --> 00:58:17,222
对不起，你说…
I'm sorry. Did you say...

951
00:58:17,353 --> 00:58:19,345
自我上船来，佐维斯就一直运行破解程式
Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.

952
00:58:19,481 --> 00:58:21,057
几小时后，我就可以得知
In a few hours, I'll know every dirty secret

953
00:58:21,191 --> 00:58:22,352
神盾局的隐藏机密
S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide.

954
00:58:22,484 --> 00:58:23,478
吃蓝莓吗?
Blueberry?

955
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:25,482
你仍为没被招揽而百思不解？
Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around.

956
00:58:25,612 --> 00:58:28,446
情报机构竟然害怕聪明人？
An intelligence organisation that fears intelligence?

957
00:58:28,573 --> 00:58:30,150
真没劲
Historically, not awesome.

958
00:58:30,283 --> 00:58:32,571
洛基想挑拨离间
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

959
00:58:32,702 --> 00:58:34,279
洛基肯定意图发动战争
This is a man who means to start a war

960
00:58:34,412 --> 00:58:35,953
继续这样下去，岂不正中他下怀
and if we don't stay focused, he'll succeed.

961
00:58:37,248 --> 00:58:39,703
既然有命在身，就要服从
We have orders. We should follow them.

962
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:42,201
我可不喜欢臣服于他人
Following's not really my style.

963
00:58:43,421 --> 00:58:45,792
你想出风头吧？
And you're all about style, aren't you?

964
00:58:45,924 --> 00:58:46,954
在座各位
Of the people in this room,

965
00:58:47,092 --> 00:58:48,668
当中有人着装奇异
which one is, A, wearing a spangly outfit,

966
00:58:48,802 --> 00:58:50,129
简直不成气候
and, B, not of use?

967
00:58:50,261 --> 00:58:54,590
斯蒂夫，你不觉得不自在吗？
Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you.

968
00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:58,340
找立方吧
Just find the Cube.

969
00:59:00,747 --> 00:59:02,624


970
00:59:11,282 --> 00:59:13,191
他就是让我父亲赞不绝口的家伙？
That's the guy my dad never shut up about?

971
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,446
他们应该再次冷藏他
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.

972
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:17,096
Huh.

973
00:59:17,288 --> 00:59:18,995
他很了解洛基
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

974
00:59:19,124 --> 00:59:20,866
他看事情比我们敏锐
He does have the jump on us.

975
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,704
他就像导火索
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

976
00:59:23,837 --> 00:59:25,662
迟早会搞砸一切
It's going to blow up in his face.

977
00:59:25,797 --> 00:59:28,085
到时我拭目以待
And I'm going to be there when it does.

978
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,540
我就会由新闻得知过程
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

979
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:33,958
不如你也着装加入我们
Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up with the rest of us.

980
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:34,948


981
00:59:35,557 --> 00:59:39,138
你看，可我没有护甲
You see, I don't get a suit of armour.

982
00:59:39,269 --> 00:59:42,601
赤手空拳打战简直寻死
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

983
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:44,473
太糟糕了
It's a nightmare.

984
00:59:44,607 --> 00:59:47,394
每时每刻都有一堆炮弹碎片
I've got a cluster of shrapnel trying every second

985
00:59:47,527 --> 00:59:49,519
试图侵入我心脏
to crawl its way into my heart.

986
00:59:49,654 --> 00:59:51,693
这个保护了我
This stops it.

987
00:59:51,823 --> 00:59:54,147
这个小光环是我身体一部分了
This little circle of light, it's part of me now,

988
00:59:55,368 --> 00:59:57,027
不止是护甲
not just armour.

989
00:59:57,704 --> 01:00:00,158
是可怕的天赐
It's a terrible privilege.

990
01:00:00,497 --> 01:00:02,868
- 不过你可以控制它 - 我只是学会使用
- But you can control it. - Because I learned how.

991
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:03,995
不能这样说
It's different.

992
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:07,667
我听闻过你的事情
Hey, I read all about your accident.

993
01:00:07,796 --> 01:00:11,129
如此强的伽马射线早该杀死你
That much gamma exposure should have killed you.

994
01:00:11,258 --> 01:00:13,713
你意指绿巨人浩克
So you're saying that the Hulk...

995
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:17,550
他救了我？
The other guy saved my life?

996
01:00:18,056 --> 01:00:19,170
说得好
That's nice.

997
01:00:20,058 --> 01:00:23,841
观点不错，可为什么救我？
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

998
01:00:25,147 --> 01:00:27,055
我们会知道的
I guess we'll find out.

999
01:00:28,776 --> 01:00:30,435
届时你就会闷闷不乐
You may not enjoy that.

1000
01:00:30,569 --> 01:00:32,525
说不定你会高兴起来
And you just might.

1001
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:36,709
（机密仓库10-C）

1002
01:00:37,218 --> 01:00:39,262


1003
01:00:39,345 --> 01:00:40,805


1004
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:55,570


1005
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:33,130
洛基一带走博士
As soon as Loki took the doctor,

1006
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:34,999
我们就把珍儿转移了
we moved Jane Foster.

1007
01:01:35,134 --> 01:01:37,505
挪威有个一流的天文台
They've got an excellent observatory in Tromsø.

1008
01:01:37,636 --> 01:01:41,170
珍儿昨天应邀过去做顾问
She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday.

1009
01:01:41,306 --> 01:01:45,089
酬劳不菲，有私人飞机，离这里很远
Handsome fee, private plane, very remote.

1010
01:01:45,978 --> 01:01:47,008
她会很安全
She'll be safe.

1011
01:01:47,146 --> 01:01:48,520
多谢
Thank you.

1012
01:01:50,315 --> 01:01:52,354
洛基带走艾力博士，并非巧合
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.

1013
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,933
不知道事后洛基会如何处置博士
I dread what he plans for him once he's done.

1014
01:01:56,071 --> 01:01:57,185
艾力是个好人
Erik is a good man.

1015
01:01:57,322 --> 01:01:58,317
他经常提及你
He talks about you a lot.

1016
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,192
你改变了他一生
You changed his life.

1017
01:02:03,912 --> 01:02:05,785
你也改变了这里一切
You changed everything around here.

1018
01:02:05,914 --> 01:02:08,036
还是原来的好
They were better as they were.

1019
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:10,700
在永恒国度，我们自命不凡
We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced

1020
01:02:10,836 --> 01:02:14,536
来到凡间却如巨兽
but we come here, battling like bilge snipe.

1021
01:02:14,673 --> 01:02:16,499
- 什么？ - 巨兽
- Like what? - Bilge snipe.

1022
01:02:16,633 --> 01:02:19,669
巨型，有鳞，有鹿角
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

1023
01:02:20,471 --> 01:02:22,261
- 这里没有吧？ - 应该没有
- You don't have those? - I don't think so.

1024
01:02:22,389 --> 01:02:24,262
它们很讨厌
Well, they are repulsive.

1025
01:02:25,601 --> 01:02:27,842
它们践踏所经之处
And they trample everything in their path.

1026
01:02:35,527 --> 01:02:38,860
我首次来地球时，亦使洛基迁怒于此
When I first came to Earth, Loki's rage followed me here,

1027
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:41,313
人类损失惨重
and your people paid the price.

1028
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:43,240
如今历史再现
And now, again.

1029
01:02:45,787 --> 01:02:48,241
年壮时我热衷战斗
In my youth, I courted war.

1030
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:51,991
战争还没有开始
War hasn't started yet.

1031
01:02:53,127 --> 01:02:54,918
你认为你可以令洛基告诉我们
You think you could make Loki tell us

1032
01:02:55,046 --> 01:02:56,325
立方在哪吗？
where the Tesseract is?

1033
01:02:56,464 --> 01:02:59,713
洛基深不可测
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

1034
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:04,550
他不但要权力，还要报复我
It's not just power he craves, it's vengeance, upon me.

1035
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,802
为求达到目的，他会不择手段
There's no pain would prise his need from him.

1036
01:03:07,892 --> 01:03:11,721
简直不知天高地厚
A lot of guys think that until the pain starts.

1037
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:15,516
你有何吩咐
What are you asking me to do?

1038
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:19,232
那你有何计划？
I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?

1039
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:20,392
洛基已是阶下囚
Loki is a prisoner.

1040
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:24,567
为何我觉得他才是唯一想留在船上的人？
Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here?

1041
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:40,255
可以潜近我身边的人不多
There's not many people who can sneak up on me.

1042
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:42,042
你猜到是我了
But you figured I'd come.

1043
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:44,295
不过
After.

1044
01:03:45,179 --> 01:03:48,594
应该是在局长折磨我后
After whatever tortures Fury can concoct,

1045
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:52,389
你会如知己般出现，安慰我
you would appear as a friend, as a balm.

1046
01:03:53,354 --> 01:03:55,013
接着我就会同你合作
And I would cooperate.

1047
01:03:55,148 --> 01:03:57,139
你对巴顿特工做过什么？
I want to know what you've done to Agent Barton.

1048
01:03:57,275 --> 01:03:59,266
我只是打开他心境
I would say I've expanded his mind.

1049
01:04:01,863 --> 01:04:03,771
那你赢得一切后
And once you've won,

1050
01:04:04,657 --> 01:04:05,937
成为众神之王以后
once you're king of the mountain,

1051
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:10,567
会如何处置他？
what happens to his mind?

1052
01:04:10,473 --> 01:04:11,474


1053
01:04:11,831 --> 01:04:13,621
爱之心切吗？
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

1054
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,584
爱是孩童玩意，我只是欠他人情
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

1055
01:04:20,465 --> 01:04:22,337
告诉我
Tell me.

1056
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:29,928
效力神盾局前
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D... I, uh...

1057
01:04:32,351 --> 01:04:36,265
我已稍有名气
Well, I made a name for myself.

1058
01:04:36,397 --> 01:04:39,397
因为天赋异禀
I have a very specific skill set.

1059
01:04:39,525 --> 01:04:43,189
所以肆无忌惮
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

1060
01:04:44,197 --> 01:04:47,695
因此上了神盾局的黑名单
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar in a bad way.

1061
01:04:48,868 --> 01:04:51,784
巴顿特工奉命刺杀我
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

1062
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:54,371
但他没杀我
He made a different call.

1063
01:04:56,334 --> 01:04:59,369
若我答应放过他，你会如何报答？
And what will you do if I vow to spare him?

1064
01:04:59,754 --> 01:05:01,081
我不会放你出来的
Not let you out.

1065
01:05:01,214 --> 01:05:03,086
相当有趣
No, but I like this.

1066
01:05:04,008 --> 01:05:07,423
自身难保，你竟敢讨价还价
Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man.

1067
01:05:07,553 --> 01:05:09,628
改朝换代是常有的事
Regimes fall every day.

1068
01:05:09,764 --> 01:05:12,301
我都不在乎，我是俄国人
I tend not to weep over that. I'm Russian.

1069
01:05:12,433 --> 01:05:13,428
曾是
Or I was.

1070
01:05:14,727 --> 01:05:16,386
现在呢？
And what are you now?

1071
01:05:16,854 --> 01:05:19,807
很简单
It's really not that complicated.

1072
01:05:19,941 --> 01:05:24,020
我要还清血债
I got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.

1073
01:05:25,028 --> 01:05:26,569
行吗？
Can you?

1074
01:05:27,906 --> 01:05:31,689
能还清吗？
Can you wipe out that much red?

1075
01:05:32,869 --> 01:05:34,660
得雷科夫的女儿
Dreykov's daughter,

1076
01:05:36,081 --> 01:05:37,907
圣保罗…
São Paulo,

1077
01:05:38,959 --> 01:05:41,449
医院失火事件？
the hospital fire?

1078
01:05:42,295 --> 01:05:44,667
巴顿已对我和盘托出
Barton told me everything.

1079
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:47,881
你背负不少血债
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red

1080
01:05:48,009 --> 01:05:50,499
单凭拯救个不比你好多少的人
and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself

1081
01:05:50,637 --> 01:05:52,011
就可以令自己良心好过？
will change anything?

1082
01:05:52,139 --> 01:05:54,807
未免太过自以为是
This is the basest sentimentality.

1083
01:05:54,933 --> 01:05:57,174
简直幼稚
This is a child at prayer.

1084
01:05:57,310 --> 01:05:58,590
太可怜
Pathetic!

1085
01:05:59,396 --> 01:06:01,968
你满口胡言，杀戮无数
You lie and kill

1086
01:06:02,107 --> 01:06:05,142
助纣为虐
in the service of liars and killers.

1087
01:06:05,488 --> 01:06:07,427
（发现病毒 非法入侵）

1088
01:06:08,238 --> 01:06:14,237
你以为可以置身事外
You pretend to be separate,to have your own code,something that makes up for the horrors.

1089
01:06:15,412 --> 01:06:17,818
但江山易改
But they are part of you.

1090
01:06:17,956 --> 01:06:21,739
本性难移
And they will never go away.

1091
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:25,834
巴顿没杀死你之前，我不会杀他
I won't touch Barton, not until I make him kill you.

1092
01:06:25,964 --> 01:06:28,205
我要他用尽你所恐惧的方式
Slowly, intimately,

1093
01:06:28,341 --> 01:06:30,713
驾轻就熟地杀死你
in every way he knows you fear.

1094
01:06:30,844 --> 01:06:33,927
当他苏醒时，见到自己的所为
And then he'll wake just long enough to see his good work

1095
01:06:34,055 --> 01:06:37,506
就会尖叫，而我会趁机取他首级
and when he screams, I'll split his skull.

1096
01:06:37,642 --> 01:06:40,761
这就是我的目的，哭吧，贱人
This is my bargain, you mewling quim.

1097
01:06:40,581 --> 01:06:41,999


1098
01:06:42,355 --> 01:06:43,932
怪物
You're a monster.

1099
01:06:44,794 --> 01:06:46,003


1100
01:06:46,087 --> 01:06:47,588
噢，不
Oh, no.

1101
01:06:48,528 --> 01:06:50,105
你带来的那个才是怪物
You brought the monster.

1102
01:06:53,116 --> 01:06:54,693
利用班纳
So, Banner.

1103
01:06:55,744 --> 01:06:56,905
这就是你的计划
That's your play.

1104
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:57,951
什么？
What?

1105
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:00,698
洛基计划利用班纳
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

1106
01:07:00,832 --> 01:07:02,290
令班纳留在实验室，我马上过来
Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.

1107
01:07:02,417 --> 01:07:03,495
顺道也让托尔过来
Send Thor as well.

1108
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:06,497
多谢
Thank you

1109
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:08,787
你的合作
for your cooperation.

1110
01:07:16,306 --> 01:07:17,764
干嘛，史塔先生
What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

1111
01:07:17,891 --> 01:07:20,381
我同你有一样的疑惑
Uh, kind of been wondering the same thing about you.

1112
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:22,391
你本该追踪立方的位置
You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.

1113
01:07:22,521 --> 01:07:24,097
没错，已经锁定位置
We are. The model's locked

1114
01:07:24,231 --> 01:07:25,510
正在匹配标记
and we're sweeping for the signature now.

1115
01:07:25,649 --> 01:07:26,644
顺利的话
When we get a hit,

1116
01:07:26,775 --> 01:07:28,731
就可以锁定目标于半公里范围内
we'll have the location within half a mile.

1117
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:31,362
接着就可以拿回立方，别着急
Yeah, then you get your Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1118
01:07:31,363 --> 01:07:33,105


1119
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,353
何为「第二阶段」？
What is "Phase 2"?

1120
01:07:36,576 --> 01:07:39,410
第二阶段是神盾局会利用立方制作武器
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses the Cube to make weapons.

1121
01:07:39,538 --> 01:07:41,280
对不起，电脑不如我反应快
Sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me.

1122
01:07:41,415 --> 01:07:44,118
罗杰斯，我们收集了所有有关立方的信息
Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract.

1123
01:07:44,251 --> 01:07:45,708
这不代表我们要制作…
This does not mean that we're making...

1124
01:07:45,836 --> 01:07:46,830
得了
I'm sorry, Nick.

1125
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:49,249
你还想狡辩
What were you lying?

1126
01:07:49,381 --> 01:07:50,625
原来如此
I was wrong, Director.

1127
01:07:50,757 --> 01:07:51,787
世界还是没有改变
The world hasn't changed a bit.

1128
01:07:51,925 --> 01:07:52,955
你知情？
Did you know about this?

1129
01:07:53,093 --> 01:07:55,880
博士，你想离开这里吗？
You want to think about removing yourself from this environment, Doctor?

1130
01:07:56,012 --> 01:07:58,170
我在加尔各答时，也很想离开
I was in Calcutta. I was pretty well removed.

1131
01:07:58,306 --> 01:07:59,468
洛基在利用你
Loki is manipulating you.

1132
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,176
那你呢？
And you've been doing what, exactly?

1133
01:08:01,309 --> 01:08:02,968
你不是因我对你抛媚眼而来这里
You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.

1134
01:08:03,103 --> 01:08:05,634
那我也不会因为你觉得不安而离开
Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy.

1135
01:08:05,772 --> 01:08:07,396
我想知道为什么
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1136
01:08:07,523 --> 01:08:11,223
神盾局要利用立方来制作大杀伤力武器
is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.

1137
01:08:11,861 --> 01:08:12,974
因为他
Because of him.

1138
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,275
我？
Me?

1139
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,611
去年，有异星客来访地球
Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet

1140
01:08:18,743 --> 01:08:21,908
异星客间的斗争摧毁了一个小镇
who had a grudge match that leveled a small town.

1141
01:08:22,037 --> 01:08:24,243
我们才知道原来天外有生命
We learned that not only are we not alone

1142
01:08:24,373 --> 01:08:27,955
而且相较之下，人类简直不堪一击
but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.

1143
01:08:28,085 --> 01:08:30,326
我的臣民只想和你们和平共处
My people want nothing but peace with your planet.

1144
01:08:30,463 --> 01:08:32,419
你不是唯一的天外生命体
But you're not the only people out there, are you?

1145
01:08:32,548 --> 01:08:34,504
难保没有其他生命体威胁地球
And you're not the only threat.

1146
01:08:34,633 --> 01:08:37,799
正所谓一山还有一山高
The world's filling up with people who can't be matched,

1147
01:08:38,471 --> 01:08:39,668
世事难以控制
that can't be controlled.

1148
01:08:39,805 --> 01:08:40,919
所以要控制立方？
Like you controlled the Cube?

1149
01:08:41,056 --> 01:08:42,300
正因为你开发立方
Your work with the Tesseract

1150
01:08:42,433 --> 01:08:45,005
才招致洛基等人到来
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

1151
01:08:45,144 --> 01:08:46,518
你已经向九大领域传达一个信息
It is a signal to all the realms

1152
01:08:46,645 --> 01:08:49,314
宣布地球已经准备好高规格战斗
that the Earth is ready for a higher form of war.

1153
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:50,518
高规格战斗
A higher form?

1154
01:08:50,649 --> 01:08:51,644
你逼人在先
You forced our hand.

1155
01:08:51,776 --> 01:08:52,770
我们总要有对策
We had to come up with something.

1156
01:08:52,902 --> 01:08:53,896
用核武器镇压
A nuclear deterrent.

1157
01:08:54,028 --> 01:08:56,019
这总能避免大动干戈
Because that always calms everything right down.

1158
01:08:56,155 --> 01:08:58,526
我倒忘了你可是发战争财起家的
Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark.

1159
01:08:58,657 --> 01:09:01,029
若他仍制作武器，他就会…
I'm sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck-deep...

1160
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,783
干嘛矛头对向我了？
Hold on. How is this now about me?

1161
01:09:02,912 --> 01:09:04,025
你不是喜欢一切对向你吗？
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1162
01:09:04,163 --> 01:09:06,036
还以为人类已经高度文明了
I thought humans were more evolved than this.

1163
01:09:06,165 --> 01:09:09,035
再怎么也不会跑到尊星球打仗啦
Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?

1164
01:09:09,168 --> 01:09:11,041
你们如此不信任你的战友
You treat your champions with such mistrust.

1165
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:12,628
你们好天真啊
Are you boys really that naïve?

1166
01:09:12,755 --> 01:09:14,628
神盾局监视潜在危险
S.H.I.E.L.D. monitors potential threats.

1167
01:09:14,757 --> 01:09:16,036
美国队长也是潜在威胁?
Captain America's on threat watch?

1168
01:09:16,175 --> 01:09:17,170
我们都是
We all are.

1169
01:09:17,301 --> 01:09:18,711
你也在监视列表上？
Wait, you're on that list?

1170
01:09:18,844 --> 01:09:20,385
你在强忍怒气吗？
Are you above or below angry bees?

1171
01:09:20,513 --> 01:09:22,635
史塔，你试试再耍嘴皮…
Stark, so help me God, if you make one more wisecrack...

1172
01:09:22,765 --> 01:09:24,009
威胁我！我好怕啊
Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.

1173
01:09:24,141 --> 01:09:26,631
- 放尊重点 - 尊重什么？
- Show some respect. - Respect what?

1174
01:09:26,664 --> 01:09:28,749


1175
01:09:33,984 --> 01:09:36,901
运输机66B，请回复确认代码
Transport Six-Six-Bravo, please relay confirm codes.

1176
01:09:37,029 --> 01:09:39,187
电脑中找到你的资料，但不是在航行日志中
I've got you on the computer, but not on the day log.

1177
01:09:39,323 --> 01:09:41,398
请告知货物
What is your haul? Over.

1178
01:09:41,534 --> 01:09:44,154
武器和弹药
Arms and ammunition. Over.

1179
01:09:52,503 --> 01:09:54,708
说到秩序，这里不也一团糟
You speak of control, yet you court chaos.

1180
01:09:54,839 --> 01:09:56,546
这就是他的管理手法
That's his M.O., isn't it?

1181
01:09:56,674 --> 01:09:57,918
我们还是一个团队吗？
I mean, what are we, a team?

1182
01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:01,003
我们只是制造混乱的化学怪物
No, we're a chemical mixture that makes chaos.

1183
01:10:01,137 --> 01:10:03,093
我们是定时炸弹
We're a time bomb.

1184
01:10:03,222 --> 01:10:05,048
你冷静下
You need to step away.

1185
01:10:05,182 --> 01:10:07,008
为何不让人发泄下？
Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?

1186
01:10:07,143 --> 01:10:09,265
明知故问，走开
You know damn well why. Back off!

1187
01:10:09,395 --> 01:10:11,600
你有本事让我走开吗
I'm starting to want you to make me.

1188
01:10:11,731 --> 01:10:15,348
躲在盔甲内装英雄
Yeah. Big man in a suit of armour.

1189
01:10:15,484 --> 01:10:16,942
没有盔甲，你还能是什么？
Take that off, what are you?

1190
01:10:17,069 --> 01:10:19,393
是天才，富翁，花花公子，慈善家
Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.

1191
01:10:20,281 --> 01:10:23,446
很多没有那些头衔的人，都比你厉害
I know guys with none of that worth ten of you.

1192
01:10:23,576 --> 01:10:24,570
我看过你的镜头
I've seen the footage.

1193
01:10:24,702 --> 01:10:26,943
你只会为自己而战
The only thing you really fight for is yourself.

1194
01:10:28,414 --> 01:10:30,322
你不会顾全大局
You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play,

1195
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:32,948
你不会躺在铁丝网，让别人走过
to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.

1196
01:10:33,085 --> 01:10:35,207
我会剪掉铁丝
I think I would just cut the wire.

1197
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,045
就会耍急智
Always a way out.

1198
01:10:40,176 --> 01:10:41,420
你或许构不成威胁
You may not be a threat

1199
01:10:41,552 --> 01:10:43,460
但你别再假装是英雄
but you better stop pretending to be a hero.

1200
01:10:43,596 --> 01:10:46,050
像你这样的英雄？
A hero? Like you?

1201
01:10:46,182 --> 01:10:48,220
你只是个实验品
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.

1202
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:51,968
你的超能力只是来自一瓶血清
Everything special about you came out of a bottle.

1203
01:11:14,021 --> 01:11:15,022


1204
01:11:17,253 --> 01:11:20,087
穿上盔甲，咱们打下
Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.

1205
01:11:19,902 --> 01:11:20,945


1206
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:24,541
你们好小气
You people are so petty and tiny.

1207
01:11:24,677 --> 01:11:25,672
这就是一个团队
Yeah, this is a team.

1208
01:11:25,804 --> 01:11:27,048
罗曼诺夫特工，请你护送
Agent Romanoff, would you escort

1209
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:28,294
班纳博士回去…
Dr. Banner back to his...

1210
01:11:28,431 --> 01:11:30,090
回哪去？你已经把我的房间占了
Where? You rented my room.

1211
01:11:30,225 --> 01:11:31,682
那只是以防…
The cell was just in case...

1212
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:33,351
以防你想杀了我
In case you needed to kill me.

1213
01:11:33,478 --> 01:11:36,394
不过那是不可能的，我曾试过
But you can't. I know, I tried.

1214
01:11:39,109 --> 01:11:42,025
最低潮时期，我万念俱灰
I got low. I didn't see an end.

1215
01:11:42,153 --> 01:11:46,613
我饮弹自尽，可绿巨人却吐出来
So, I put a bullet in my mouth, and the other guy spit it out.

1216
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,397
所以我死不成
So I moved on.

1217
01:11:48,535 --> 01:11:51,369
之后我致力帮助他人，本来相安无事
I focused on helping other people. I was good.

1218
01:11:51,496 --> 01:11:53,701
直到你拉我回到这个怪物聚会
Until you dragged me back into this freak show

1219
01:11:53,832 --> 01:11:55,206
把所有人置于危险之中
and put everyone here at risk.

1220
01:11:55,333 --> 01:11:57,408
想知道我的秘诀吗，罗曼诺夫探员？
You want to know my secret, Agent Romanoff?

1221
01:11:57,544 --> 01:11:59,369
想知道我怎么保持冷静？
You want to know how I stay calm?

1222
01:12:02,173 --> 01:12:04,331
班纳博士
Dr. Banner,

1223
01:12:05,135 --> 01:12:06,462
放下权杖
put down the sceptre.

1224
01:12:11,896 --> 01:12:12,565
（伽马射线 吻合度百分之九十五）

1225
01:12:12,705 --> 01:12:14,081


1226
01:12:15,228 --> 01:12:16,390
找到了
Got it.

1227
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:18,225
对不起，孩子们
Sorry, kids,

1228
01:12:18,356 --> 01:12:20,099
你们见识不到我的拿手好戏了
you don't get to see my party trick after all.

1229
01:12:20,233 --> 01:12:21,228
找到立方？
You located the Tesseract?

1230
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:22,354
我可以很快到达
I could get there fastest.

1231
01:12:22,485 --> 01:12:24,607
立方属于亚斯加特，人类无法驾驭它
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard. No human is a match for it.

1232
01:12:24,738 --> 01:12:26,065
- 你不能独自去 - 你要阻止我？
- You're not going alone. - You're gonna stop me?

1233
01:12:26,197 --> 01:12:27,192
穿上盔甲，比试下
Put on the suit, let's find out.

1234
01:12:27,323 --> 01:12:28,603
我才不怕和老年人打架
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

1235
01:12:28,742 --> 01:12:29,736
穿上盔甲
Put on the suit.

1236
01:12:29,596 --> 01:12:30,681


1237
01:12:31,656 --> 01:12:32,085
（伽马射线定位）

1238
01:12:32,558 --> 01:12:33,934
噢，我的天啊
Oh, my God.

1239
01:12:42,735 --> 01:12:43,736


1240
01:12:49,763 --> 01:12:50,757
穿上盔甲
Put on the suit.

1241
01:12:50,784 --> 01:12:52,119
耶
Yeah.

1242
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:54,121


1243
01:12:54,934 --> 01:12:56,677
各就各位
All hands to stations.

1244
01:12:58,292 --> 01:12:59,793


1245
01:13:00,815 --> 01:13:02,606
机身外部受袭
External detonation.

1246
01:13:02,734 --> 01:13:03,978
三号引擎停止运作
Number three engine is down.

1247
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:05,105
我们受袭
We've been hit.

1248
01:13:05,236 --> 01:13:06,398
- 能否重运作？ - 三号引擎着火
- Can they get it running? - Fire in engine three!

1249
01:13:06,529 --> 01:13:07,524
具体如何
Talk to me.

1250
01:13:07,655 --> 01:13:09,279
涡轮似乎完好
Turbine looks mostly intact

1251
01:13:09,407 --> 01:13:12,819
但在空中无法修复机件
but it's impossible to get out there to make repairs while we're in the air.

1252
01:13:12,952 --> 01:13:15,489
再多个引擎坏掉，就会坠机
If we lose one more engine, we won't be.

1253
01:13:15,622 --> 01:13:17,613
要派人出去修复引擎
Somebody's got to get outside and patch that engine.

1254
01:13:17,749 --> 01:13:19,456
- 史塔，收到吗？ - 我马上去
- Stark, you copy that? - I'm on it.

1255
01:13:19,584 --> 01:13:22,869
古逊，关押区实施防御封锁

1257
01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:25,244
罗曼诺夫？
Romanoff?

1258
01:13:26,945 --> 01:13:28,739


1259
01:13:28,885 --> 01:13:30,343
我们没事
We're okay.

1260
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:32,117


1261
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:34,174
会没事的
We're okay, right?

1262
01:13:46,777 --> 01:13:47,974
- 不要让他们修复引擎 - 遵命
- Keep that engine down! - Yes, sir.

1263
01:13:48,112 --> 01:13:49,819
去关押区，等待监视器关闭
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.

1264
01:13:49,947 --> 01:13:51,737
- 收到 - 跟紧
- Got it. - Stay close.

1265
01:13:53,492 --> 01:13:54,985
走，到第四层
Let's go, Level 4.

1266
01:13:55,953 --> 01:13:58,739
三号引擎，在那里碰头
Engine three. I'll meet you there.

1267
01:14:03,649 --> 01:14:04,817


1268
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:06,777


1269
01:14:06,922 --> 01:14:08,084
博士？
Doctor?

1270
01:14:07,903 --> 01:14:08,904


1271
01:14:10,467 --> 01:14:11,462
布斯？
Bruce?

1272
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,424
冷静，否则正中洛基下怀
You got to fight it. This is just what Loki wants.

1273
01:14:16,807 --> 01:14:17,837
听着，会没事的
We're going to be okay. Listen to me.

1274
01:14:17,975 --> 01:14:18,970
你受伤了吗
Are you hurt?

1275
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:24,476
会没事的
We're going to be okay. All right?

1276
01:14:24,606 --> 01:14:27,357
我以性命担保，我会救你出去
I swear on my life, I will get you out of this.

1277
01:14:27,484 --> 01:14:28,859
你可以从此不问世事
You will walk away and never ever...

1278
01:14:28,986 --> 01:14:31,061
以你性命担保？
Your life?

1279
01:14:32,219 --> 01:14:33,846


1280
01:14:42,104 --> 01:14:43,814


1281
01:14:47,588 --> 01:14:48,582
布斯
Bruce.

1282
01:14:49,278 --> 01:14:50,737


1283
01:14:55,117 --> 01:14:56,702


1284
01:14:59,246 --> 01:15:00,247


1285
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:14,344


1286
01:15:15,429 --> 01:15:16,763


1287
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,352


1288
01:15:25,459 --> 01:15:26,125
水平翻转机身，朝南前进！
Bring the carrier about to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1289
01:15:26,126 --> 01:15:28,616
水平翻转机身，朝南前进！
Bring the carrier about to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1290
01:15:28,754 --> 01:15:30,627
- 飞到海面 - 我们失去了导航
- Take us to the water! - We're flying blind.

1291
01:15:30,756 --> 01:15:32,747
导航系统在重新校准
Navigation's recalibrating after the engine failure.

1292
01:15:32,883 --> 01:15:34,625
还没日出吗？
Is the sun coming up?

1293
01:15:35,385 --> 01:15:37,591
- 对 - 对照太阳找方向
- Yes, sir. - Then put it on the left.

1294
01:15:37,721 --> 01:15:39,380
飞到海面
Get us over water.

1295
01:15:39,515 --> 01:15:41,590
再多个引擎失事，就会坠机
One more turbine goes down, and we drop.

1296
01:15:42,289 --> 01:15:43,707


1297
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:45,125
- 谢谢
- Thanks.

1298
01:15:48,482 --> 01:15:49,644
史塔
Stark!

1299
01:15:52,361 --> 01:15:54,020
史塔，我来了
Stark, I'm here!

1300
01:15:54,092 --> 01:15:55,302
好
Good.

1301
01:15:56,865 --> 01:15:58,857
看下情况如何
Let's see what we've got.

1302
01:15:58,992 --> 01:16:00,651
我要让这个超导制冷系统
I got to get this superconducting coolant system

1303
01:16:00,786 --> 01:16:01,781
重运作
back online

1304
01:16:01,912 --> 01:16:03,370
接近回转轴前
before I can access the rotors,

1305
01:16:03,497 --> 01:16:05,323
我要清理残骸
work on dislodging the debris.

1306
01:16:07,876 --> 01:16:09,417
你到引擎控制箱
I need you to get to that engine control panel

1307
01:16:09,545 --> 01:16:13,209
告诉我哪个继电器超荷
and tell me which relays are in overload position.

1308
01:16:13,987 --> 01:16:15,322


1309
01:16:25,518 --> 01:16:27,059
控制箱是怎样的？
What does it look like in there?

1310
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:30,307
一堆电路板的样子吗？
It seems to run on some form of electricity.

1311
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,182
你说得没错
Well, you're not wrong.

1312
01:16:36,843 --> 01:16:39,012


1313
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:47,854


1314
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:50,857


1315
01:17:07,332 --> 01:17:08,333


1316
01:17:10,585 --> 01:17:11,586


1317
01:17:25,892 --> 01:17:27,060


1318
01:17:27,144 --> 01:17:28,145


1319
01:17:32,566 --> 01:17:33,567


1320
01:17:36,005 --> 01:17:38,839
我们不是你的敌人，班纳
We are not your enemies, Banner.

1321
01:17:38,966 --> 01:17:39,961
醒醒
- Try to think!

1322
01:17:43,618 --> 01:17:45,871


1323
01:17:50,103 --> 01:17:51,975
继电器正常了
Okay, the relays are intact.

1324
01:17:52,105 --> 01:17:53,562
接下来呢？
What's our next move?

1325
01:17:53,689 --> 01:17:54,684
即使我修复回转轴
Even if I clear the rotors,

1326
01:17:54,816 --> 01:17:57,021
这东西也要借外力才能动起来
this thing won't re-engage without a jump.

1327
01:17:57,151 --> 01:17:58,526
我要入内推动
I'm going to have to get in there and push.

1328
01:17:58,653 --> 01:18:00,395
如果转速加剧，会搅碎你
If that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded.

1329
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:02,521
定子控制单元能翻转磁极
That stator control unit can reverse the polarity

1330
01:18:02,657 --> 01:18:04,067
会有足够时间脱离磁浮力
long enough to disengage maglev and that could...

1331
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,527
听不懂
Speak English!

1332
01:18:06,869 --> 01:18:07,983
看到红色扳手吗？
You see that red lever?

1333
01:18:09,288 --> 01:18:11,410
可以降低转速，提供足够时间让我出去
It will slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out.

1334
01:18:11,541 --> 01:18:13,331
就位，等我信号
Stand by it. Wait for my word.

1335
01:18:16,026 --> 01:18:17,194


1336
01:18:23,158 --> 01:18:24,993


1337
01:18:43,512 --> 01:18:44,679


1338
01:18:49,184 --> 01:18:50,185


1339
01:18:54,314 --> 01:18:55,399


1340
01:19:00,695 --> 01:19:01,696


1341
01:19:05,927 --> 01:19:07,718
要清空下层机舱
We need full evac on the lower hangar bay.

1342
01:19:10,932 --> 01:19:11,963
手榴弹！
Grenade!

1343
01:19:12,499 --> 01:19:13,500


1344
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:18,755


1345
01:19:22,342 --> 01:19:23,343


1346
01:19:27,115 --> 01:19:28,443
有入侵者
We've got a perimeter breach!

1347
01:19:28,575 --> 01:19:30,614
有人入侵神盾局
Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. gear.

1348
01:19:30,744 --> 01:19:32,819
各就各位
Call-outs at every junction.

1349
01:19:38,525 --> 01:19:39,526


1350
01:19:40,128 --> 01:19:42,334
绿巨人和托尔在第四层实验室
We have the Hulk and Thor on Research Level 4.

1351
01:19:42,464 --> 01:19:44,005
二三两层没信号
Levels 2 and 3 are dark.

1352
01:19:44,132 --> 01:19:46,254
长官，绿巨人会摧毁整艘船
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

1353
01:19:47,469 --> 01:19:48,464
转移他注意力
Get his attention.

1354
01:19:48,595 --> 01:19:52,758
护航舰6-0到Y形区迎战
Escort 6-0, proceed to Wishbone and engage hostile.

1355
01:19:52,891 --> 01:19:54,170
别靠得太近
Don't get too close.

1356
01:19:54,309 --> 01:19:55,683
收到
Copy.

1357
01:20:07,614 --> 01:20:08,988
发现目标
Target acquired.

1358
01:20:09,556 --> 01:20:11,558

01:20:13,286 --> 01:20:14,281
锁定目标
Target engaged.

1360
01:20:22,736 --> 01:20:24,237


1361
01:20:25,924 --> 01:20:27,465
目标发飙了
Target angry, target angry!

1362
01:20:48,178 --> 01:20:49,804


1363
01:21:08,114 --> 01:21:09,115


1364
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:12,869


1365
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:16,414


1366
01:21:17,582 --> 01:21:18,792


1367
01:21:20,252 --> 01:21:21,253


1368
01:21:34,516 --> 01:21:35,517


1369
01:21:35,869 --> 01:21:38,074
他们不准备攻破这里，那究竟…
They're not getting through here, so what the hell...

1370
01:21:38,853 --> 01:21:39,980


1371
01:21:48,655 --> 01:21:50,615


1372
01:21:51,682 --> 01:21:53,611
（一号引擎出现故障）

1373
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:55,328


1374
01:21:56,472 --> 01:21:58,713
一号引擎停止运行
Engine one is now in shut-down.

1375
01:22:02,168 --> 01:22:03,503


1376
01:22:07,149 --> 01:22:09,307

01:22:19,578 --> 01:22:21,700
我是罗曼诺夫
This is Agent Romanoff.

1382
01:22:21,831 --> 01:22:23,288
收到
I copy.

1383

史塔，我们要坠毁了
Stark, we're losing altitude.

1384
01:22:29,046 --> 01:22:30,504
我知道了
Yeah, I noticed.

1385
01:22:52,385 --> 01:22:53,762


1386
01:22:59,351 --> 01:23:00,352
不
No!

1387
01:23:08,169 --> 01:23:10,872
这招对你真是屡试不爽
Are you ever not going to fall for that?

1388
01:23:12,197 --> 01:23:14,532


1389
01:23:25,919 --> 01:23:26,920


1390
01:23:30,423 --> 01:23:32,300


1391
01:23:37,138 --> 01:23:39,265


1392
01:23:42,686 --> 01:23:43,687


1393
01:23:53,881 --> 01:23:56,122
人类认为我们是不死之身
The humans think us immortal.

1394
01:23:57,218 --> 01:23:58,759
要试下吗？
Should we test that?

1395
01:23:58,785 --> 01:23:59,786


1396
01:24:01,555 --> 01:24:02,752
请让开
Move away, please.

1397
01:24:07,228 --> 01:24:08,721
喜欢吗？
You like this?

1398
01:24:09,688 --> 01:24:12,938
自你派来毁灭者后，我们就开始研制
We started working on the prototype after you sent the Destroyer.

1399
01:24:14,151 --> 01:24:16,392
我不知道它能干什么
Even I don't know what it does.

1400
01:24:17,196 --> 01:24:18,440
想见识下吗？
- Do you want to find out?

1401
01:24:18,972 --> 01:24:20,140

娜塔莎
Natasha?

1410
01:25:37,801 --> 01:25:39,135


1411
01:25:43,389 --> 01:25:44,390


1412
01:25:58,488 --> 01:26:00,240


1413
01:26:04,427 --> 01:26:06,170
你必败无疑
You're going to lose.

1414
01:26:08,223 --> 01:26:09,420
是吗
Am I?

1415
01:26:10,725 --> 01:26:13,215
你本性使然
It's in your nature.

1416
01:26:15,397 --> 01:26:17,721
你们的团队四分五裂
Your heroes are scattered.

1417
01:26:17,857 --> 01:26:21,557
你们空中要塞要堕落
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

1418
01:26:21,694 --> 01:26:23,318
我有何弱点？
Where is my disadvantage?

1419
01:26:23,988 --> 01:26:26,063
你缺乏信念
You lack conviction.

1420
01:26:26,908 --> 01:26:27,903
我不觉得…
I don't think I'm...

1421
01:26:27,809 --> 01:26:29,269


1422
01:26:34,749 --> 01:26:36,458
原来有这样的威力
So, that's what it does.

1423
01:26:36,317 --> 01:26:37,944


1424
01:26:55,128 --> 01:26:55,962


1425
01:27:09,283 --> 01:27:10,278
队长，拉动扳手
Cap, hit the lever.

1426
01:27:10,659 --> 01:27:13,232
要等一下
I need a minute here!

1427
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:14,448
快拉
Lever

1428
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:15,693
马上
now!

1429
01:27:25,241 --> 01:27:26,326
哦 吼
Uh-oh.

1430
01:27:27,676 --> 01:27:28,790
救命
Help!

1431
01:27:28,995 --> 01:27:30,079


1432
01:27:31,497 --> 01:27:32,498


1433
01:27:43,676 --> 01:27:45,178


1434
01:27:46,262 --> 01:27:47,847


1435
01:28:04,421 --> 01:28:05,796
对不起，老大
Sorry, boss.

1436
01:28:05,923 --> 01:28:07,630
那家伙走了
The god rabbited.

1437
01:28:07,758 --> 01:28:09,216
保持清醒
Just stay awake.

1438
01:28:09,343 --> 01:28:10,966
看着我
Eyes on me.

1439
01:28:11,095 --> 01:28:12,636
我不行了
No, I'm clocking out here.

1440
01:28:12,763 --> 01:28:14,256
振作
Not an option.

1441
01:28:15,265 --> 01:28:17,222
没事的，老大
It's okay, boss.

1442
01:28:19,144 --> 01:28:21,183
这样下去不行的
This was never gonna work

1443
01:28:21,313 --> 01:28:22,593
除非他们能…
if they didn't have something

1444
01:28:23,883 --> 01:28:25,343
to...

1445
01:28:54,596 --> 01:28:56,422
古逊特工倒下了
Agent Coulson is down.

1446
01:28:57,808 --> 01:28:59,515
医疗部队正赶来
A medical team is on its way to your location.

1447
01:28:59,643 --> 01:29:01,101
他们已到了
They're here.

1448
01:29:04,314 --> 01:29:05,938
有人叫了
They called it.

1449
01:29:22,416 --> 01:29:24,039
在费尔·古逊外套里找到的
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

1450
01:29:27,379 --> 01:29:29,501
估计没来得及找你签名
I guess he never did get you to sign them.

1451
01:29:33,010 --> 01:29:34,669
我们在空中孤立无助
We're dead in the air up here.

1452
01:29:34,803 --> 01:29:37,887
通讯被断，立方又找不到
Our communications, the location of the Cube,

1453
01:29:38,015 --> 01:29:40,421
班纳和托尔不知所踪
Banner, Thor...

1454
01:29:41,727 --> 01:29:43,635
我也无能为力
I got nothing for you.

1455
01:29:43,771 --> 01:29:46,687
我失去了我的心腹
I lost my one good eye.

1456
01:29:49,734 --> 01:29:52,734
或许我罪有应得
Maybe I had that coming.

1457
01:29:56,893 --> 01:29:58,227
是
Yes,

1458
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:02,743
我们打算利用立方制作武器
we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract.

1459
01:30:04,207 --> 01:30:06,115
但我没全把赌注压在这个上
I never put all my chips on that number, though

1460
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:09,286
因为还有更值得一赌的东西
because I was playing something even riskier.

1461
01:30:13,257 --> 01:30:17,384
有个构思，史塔也知道的
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

1462
01:30:19,263 --> 01:30:22,596
称为复仇者计划
called the Avengers Initiative.

1463
01:30:23,810 --> 01:30:28,599
构思是聚集天赋异禀的人士
The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people

1464
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:32,233
看他们能否有更大作为
to see if they could become something more.

1465
01:30:33,611 --> 01:30:37,774
能否在需要时齐心协力
To see if they could work together when we needed them to,

1466
01:30:37,907 --> 01:30:41,240
应对本无胜算的战斗
to fight the battles that we never could.

1467
01:30:43,996 --> 01:30:48,823
古逊直到死前仍坚信此构思
Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea.

1468
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:52,829
坚信你们会不负所托
In heroes.

1469
01:31:00,873 --> 01:31:02,500
好
Well,

1470
01:31:03,349 --> 01:31:06,017
这构思已过时
it's an old-fashioned notion.

1471
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:28,820
你从天上掉下来
You fell out of the sky.

1472
01:31:38,411 --> 01:31:39,787


1473
01:31:42,847 --> 01:31:44,340
没砸伤到谁吧？
Did I hurt anybody?

1474
01:31:44,474 --> 01:31:47,509
没有
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

1475
01:31:47,643 --> 01:31:50,928
只是吓坏了鸽子而已
You did scare the hell out of some pigeons, though.

1476
01:31:51,773 --> 01:31:52,803
真好运
Lucky.

1477
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:54,564
或者下落点选得好
Or just good aim.

1478
01:31:54,692 --> 01:31:56,269
你掉下来时还醒着
You were awake when you fell.

1479
01:31:58,362 --> 01:32:00,401
- 你看到了？ - 全程看到
- You saw? - The whole thing.

1480
01:32:00,531 --> 01:32:02,155
砸穿屋顶
Right through the ceiling.

1481
01:32:02,283 --> 01:32:06,232
又大又绿，一丝不挂
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

1482
01:32:06,370 --> 01:32:07,484
给
Here.

1483
01:32:08,873 --> 01:32:13,574
你恢复了正常尺寸，就能穿上这衣服
Didn't think those would fit you until you shrunk down to a regular-size feller.

1484
01:32:15,922 --> 01:32:17,201
多谢
Thank you.

1485
01:32:18,216 --> 01:32:19,460
你是外星人？
Are you an alien?

1486
01:32:20,051 --> 01:32:21,248
什么？
What?

1487
01:32:21,552 --> 01:32:22,880
来自外太空的外星人
From outer space, an alien.

1488
01:32:23,206 --> 01:32:24,248
不
No.

1489
01:32:24,889 --> 01:32:28,008
小子，你病得不轻
Well, then, son, you've got a condition.

1490
01:32:37,011 --> 01:32:38,262


1491
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:41,185
克林，你会没事的
Clint. You're going to be all right.

1492
01:32:44,533 --> 01:32:46,608
你知道？
You know that?

1493
01:32:45,686 --> 01:32:46,812


1494
01:32:47,452 --> 01:32:49,325
你知道那感觉？
Is that what you know?

1495
01:32:51,790 --> 01:32:54,659
我无法呼吸
I've got no window.

1496
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:56,836
我要赶他出去
I have to flush him out.

1497
01:32:57,754 --> 01:32:59,580
总得要花些时间恢复
You got to level out. It's going to take time.

1498
01:32:59,714 --> 01:33:01,256
你不明白
You don't understand.

1499
01:33:03,218 --> 01:33:06,467
你被他人控制过思想吗？
Have you ever had someone take your brain and play?

1500
01:33:07,264 --> 01:33:11,426
自我被赶走，用其他代替
Pull you out and stuff something else in?

1501
01:33:14,604 --> 01:33:16,976
明白心智被摧毁的感觉吗？
Do you know what it's like to be unmade?

1502
01:33:18,525 --> 01:33:20,896
你知道我有过
You know that I do.

1503
01:33:28,493 --> 01:33:29,524
我怎么苏醒的
Why am I back?

1504
01:33:30,662 --> 01:33:32,036
你怎么赶走他的？
How did you get him out?

1505
01:33:32,164 --> 01:33:34,998
重校你的思想
Cognitive recalibration.

1506
01:33:35,125 --> 01:33:37,829
我狠狠地打了你的脑袋
I hit you really hard on the head.

1507
01:33:37,961 --> 01:33:39,039
多谢
Thanks.

1508
01:33:43,341 --> 01:33:45,084
娜塔莎
Natasha...

1509
01:33:45,761 --> 01:33:46,839
我杀了多少特工
How many agents did I...

1510
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:48,428
别说了
Don't.

1511
01:33:48,555 --> 01:33:50,760
别这样折磨自己
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

1512
01:33:51,349 --> 01:33:53,056
拜洛基所赐
This is Loki.

1513
01:33:53,185 --> 01:33:55,805
拜魔鬼和魔法所赐
This is monsters and magic,

1514
01:33:55,937 --> 01:33:57,561
这种事情难以预料
and nothing we were ever trained for.

1515
01:33:57,689 --> 01:33:59,230
洛基逃掉了？
Loki, did he get away?

1516
01:33:59,051 --> 01:34:00,052


1517
01:34:00,692 --> 01:34:02,933
你应该不知道他去哪了
I don't suppose you know where.

1518
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:04,860
我不可能知道
I didn't need to know.

1519
01:34:04,988 --> 01:34:06,731
我也没问
I didn't ask.

1520
01:34:09,993 --> 01:34:12,483
他很快会有所行动
He's going to make his play soon, though.

1521
01:34:12,829 --> 01:34:13,824
就在今天
Today.

1522
01:34:13,955 --> 01:34:15,283
我们要阻止他
We got to stop him.

1523
01:34:15,957 --> 01:34:17,201
我们？
Yeah? Who's "we"?

1524
01:34:17,334 --> 01:34:19,290
包括剩下的人吧
I don't know. Whoever's left.

1525
01:34:20,531 --> 01:34:21,907
好
Well,

1526
01:34:23,548 --> 01:34:25,706
如果我射中洛基的眼眶
if I put an arrow through Loki's eye socket,

1527
01:34:25,842 --> 01:34:28,546
我定会高枕无忧
I would sleep better, I suppose.

1528
01:34:31,390 --> 01:34:32,966
你终于没事了
Now you sound like you.

1529
01:34:33,683 --> 01:34:35,141
那你呢
But you don't.

1530
01:34:37,062 --> 01:34:39,896
你只是间谍，不是士兵
You're a spy, not a soldier.

1531
01:34:40,023 --> 01:34:44,768
你却要参战，为什么？
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

1532
01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:48,486
洛基对你做了什么？
What did Loki do to you?

1533
01:34:49,241 --> 01:34:51,647
不关他的事，我只是…
He didn't. I just...

1534
01:34:55,414 --> 01:34:56,955
娜塔莎
Natasha.

1535
01:34:59,042 --> 01:35:01,034
我也被洗脑过
I've been compromised.

1536
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:06,253
我背负了不少血债
I got red in my ledger.

1537
01:35:08,385 --> 01:35:10,460
我要赎罪
I would like to wipe it out.

1538
01:35:26,485 --> 01:35:27,978
他结婚了吗
Was he married?

1539
01:35:28,112 --> 01:35:29,522
没有
No.

1540
01:35:29,655 --> 01:35:33,866
有个拉大提琴的女友吧
There was a cellist, I think.

1541
01:35:35,453 --> 01:35:36,862
我很难过
I'm sorry.

1542
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:39,239
他貌似人不错
He seemed like a good man.

1543
01:35:40,541 --> 01:35:41,619
他是个笨蛋
He was an idiot.

1544
01:35:41,751 --> 01:35:43,991
为什么，因为他的信念？
Why? For believing?

1545
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,538
单独对抗洛基
For taking on Loki alone.

1546
01:35:45,671 --> 01:35:47,378
他只是忠于职守
He was doing his job.

1547
01:35:47,506 --> 01:35:50,043
不应该由他对付洛基
He was out of his league. He should have waited.

1548
01:35:50,176 --> 01:35:51,206
他应该…
He should have...

1549
01:35:51,343 --> 01:35:52,920
总有不由自主的时候
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

1550
01:35:53,054 --> 01:35:55,175
我明白
Right, I've heard that before.

1551
01:35:55,306 --> 01:35:56,799
你第一次看到士兵死亡？
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

1552
01:35:56,932 --> 01:35:58,723
我们不是士兵
We are not soldiers.

1553
01:36:03,189 --> 01:36:04,931
我不是霍利的手下
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

1554
01:36:05,066 --> 01:36:06,227
我也不是
Neither am I.

1555
01:36:06,358 --> 01:36:08,564
他和洛基一样手染鲜血
He's got the same blood on his hands that Loki does.

1556
01:36:08,694 --> 01:36:10,068
现在，我们要摒弃前嫌
But right now, we got to put that behind us

1557
01:36:10,196 --> 01:36:12,401
齐心协力解决事情
and get this done.

1558
01:36:12,531 --> 01:36:13,526
洛基需要能源
Loki needs a power source.

1559
01:36:13,657 --> 01:36:14,652
如果我们可以列出…
If we can put together a list...

1560
01:36:14,784 --> 01:36:15,778
他喜欢挑拨离间
He made it personal.

1561
01:36:15,951 --> 01:36:16,982
这不要紧
That's not the point.

1562
01:36:17,119 --> 01:36:19,490
这就是洛基的意图
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

1563
01:36:19,622 --> 01:36:21,530
他为什么会袭击我们的飞船？
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

1564
01:36:21,665 --> 01:36:22,660
分裂我们
To tear us apart.

1565
01:36:22,792 --> 01:36:24,664
对，逐个击破
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

1566
01:36:24,794 --> 01:36:27,248
只有除掉我们，他才会赢，对不？
but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?

1567
01:36:27,379 --> 01:36:28,921
这就是他的目的
That's what he wants.

1568
01:36:29,048 --> 01:36:31,538
他想击败我们，并被世人知道
He wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it.

1569
01:36:31,675 --> 01:36:32,789
他想要观众
He wants an audience.

1570
01:36:33,511 --> 01:36:35,170
对， 我知道他在斯图加特的所作所为
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

1571
01:36:35,304 --> 01:36:38,221
对，那只是预告，现在才是首映
Yeah, that was just previews. This is opening night.

1572
01:36:38,349 --> 01:36:40,886
洛基是公主病患者
And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

1573
01:36:41,018 --> 01:36:42,595
他渴望鲜花，关注
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

1574
01:36:42,728 --> 01:36:46,511
他想要座铭刻其名的擎天大厦
He wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered...

1575
01:36:48,275 --> 01:36:49,852
糟糕了
Son of a bitch.

1576
01:36:54,417 --> 01:36:56,316
（史塔大厦）

1577
01:37:01,122 --> 01:37:02,152
该走了
Time to go.

1578
01:37:02,289 --> 01:37:03,831
- 去哪？ - 路上会告诉你
- Go where? - I'll tell you on the way.

1579
01:37:03,958 --> 01:37:04,953
会开飞机吗？
Can you fly one of those jets?

1580
01:37:06,544 --> 01:37:07,788
我会
I can.

1581
01:37:11,674 --> 01:37:12,704
有制服吗？
You got a suit?

1582
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:13,621


1583
01:37:13,968 --> 01:37:15,426
换上
Then suit up.

1584
01:37:26,884 --> 01:37:29,261


1585
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:32,431


1586
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:44,360
你们无权来此
Hey, you guys aren't authorised to be in here.

1587
01:37:44,498 --> 01:37:46,823
别多管闲事
Son, just don't.

1588
01:37:48,948 --> 01:37:49,907
长官
Sir.

1589
01:37:50,004 --> 01:37:51,201
希尔特工
Agent Hill.

1590
01:37:51,756 --> 01:37:53,297
这些卡片
Those cards,

1591
01:37:55,425 --> 01:37:59,885
可是在古逊的柜子里找到的
they were in Coulson's locker, not in his jacket.

1592
01:38:04,309 --> 01:38:05,885
不然他们就没动力干活
They needed the push.

1593
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:11,268
6号停机坪有人擅自起飞
We have an unauthorised departure from Bay 6.

1594
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:13,477
他们找到洛基了
They found him.

1595
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:18,018
尽快恢复通讯
Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do.

1596
01:38:18,156 --> 01:38:20,397
- 我要掌握情况 - 遵命
- I want eyes on everything. - Yes, sir.

1597
01:38:26,485 --> 01:38:28,320


1598
01:38:33,963 --> 01:38:35,706
我已关闭弦反应炉堆
Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor

1599
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:39,671
但立方已经自我运作
but the device is already self-sustaining.

1600
01:38:39,803 --> 01:38:41,960
关掉，绍韦博士
Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.

1601
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:43,918
太迟了
It's too late!

1602
01:38:45,975 --> 01:38:47,433
停不下来了
She can't stop now.

1603
01:38:48,478 --> 01:38:50,933
它要向我们展示…
She wants to show us something!

1604
01:38:51,064 --> 01:38:53,102
一个全新的宇宙
A new universe.

1605
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:54,388
Okay.

1606
01:38:57,224 --> 01:38:58,892


1607
01:39:01,825 --> 01:39:03,697
是纯能量防护罩
The barrier is pure energy.

1608
01:39:03,827 --> 01:39:05,699
无法击破
It's unbreachable.

1609
01:39:05,829 --> 01:39:07,619
明白
Yeah, I got that.

1610
01:39:08,832 --> 01:39:09,826
实行B计划
Plan B.

1611
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,075
装甲MK7型号仍未准备好
Sir, the Mark 7 is not ready for deployment.

1612
01:39:13,211 --> 01:39:15,452
那就不要转轮了，没时间了
Then skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock.

1613
01:39:35,191 --> 01:39:38,227
你来求我大发慈悲？
Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity.

1614
01:39:39,362 --> 01:39:41,733
其实我是来吓你的
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.

1615
01:39:41,865 --> 01:39:43,322
你最好穿上盔甲
You should have left your armour on for that.

1616
01:39:43,437 --> 01:39:44,897
Yeah.

1617
01:39:44,993 --> 01:39:46,071
没多大用处
It's seen a bit of mileage,

1618
01:39:46,202 --> 01:39:48,823
你可是拿着命运光杖
and you've got the glow stick of destiny.

1619
01:39:49,622 --> 01:39:51,910
喝一杯吗？
Would you like a drink?

1620
01:39:52,041 --> 01:39:53,155
拖延时间是没用的
Stalling me won't change anything.

1621
01:39:53,293 --> 01:39:55,415
不，是恐吓你
No, no. Threatening.

1622
01:39:55,545 --> 01:39:56,919
不喝？确定？
No drink? Are you sure?

1623
01:39:57,046 --> 01:39:58,588
那我自己喝
I'm having one.

1624
01:39:59,632 --> 01:40:03,546
智塔利军队将至，已成大局
The Chitauri are coming. Nothing will change that.

1625
01:40:04,429 --> 01:40:05,839
我还有什么好怕的？
What have I to fear?

1626
01:40:05,972 --> 01:40:07,679
复仇者联盟
The Avengers.

1627
01:40:09,768 --> 01:40:12,092
这是我们团队的名字
That's what we call ourselves. We're sort of like a team.

1628
01:40:12,228 --> 01:40:13,852
类似漫威动画「地球最强战队」
"Earth's mightiest heroes" -type thing.

1629
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:15,853
见识过了
Yes, I've met them.

1630
01:40:15,761 --> 01:40:16,845


1631
01:40:17,150 --> 01:40:18,312
花了一些功夫才团结起来
It takes us a while to get any traction,

1632
01:40:18,443 --> 01:40:19,438
保证吓死你
I'll give you that one.

1633
01:40:19,569 --> 01:40:21,774
来点个人数吧
But let's do a head count, here.

1634
01:40:21,905 --> 01:40:24,395
你的半人神兄弟
Your brother, the demigod,

1635
01:40:26,117 --> 01:40:29,699
由传奇中苏醒过来的超级士兵
a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend.

1636
01:40:29,829 --> 01:40:32,995
怒火冲天的绿巨人
A man with breathtaking anger-management issues,

1637
01:40:33,124 --> 01:40:36,208
一对大师级刺客，可惜你…
a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella,

1638
01:40:36,835 --> 01:40:39,788
得罪了他们每一个
you've managed to piss off every single one of them.

1639
01:40:39,922 --> 01:40:40,916
这就是计划
That was the plan.

1640
01:40:41,048 --> 01:40:43,039
不咋样
Not a great plan.

1641
01:40:43,175 --> 01:40:45,213
等他们进来
When they come,

1642
01:40:45,344 --> 01:40:46,802
绝对会来
and they will,

1643
01:40:46,929 --> 01:40:48,173
冲着你而来
they'll come for you.

1644
01:40:48,305 --> 01:40:49,300
我有军队
I have an army.

1645
01:40:49,431 --> 01:40:50,593
我们有绿巨人
We have a Hulk.

1646
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:52,474
我还以为那绿怪兽走了
I thought the beast had wandered off.

1647
01:40:52,601 --> 01:40:54,509
你没有搞清楚，这里没有王座
You're missing the point. There is no throne.

1648
01:40:54,645 --> 01:40:58,642
你不可能称王称霸
There is no version of this where you come out on top.

1649
01:40:58,774 --> 01:41:01,098
即使我们无法击败你的军队
Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us,

1650
01:41:01,235 --> 01:41:03,226
那也要怪你
but it's all on you.

1651
01:41:04,029 --> 01:41:05,107
如果拯救不了世界
Because if we can't protect the Earth,

1652
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:08,399
我们会找你复仇
you can be damn well sure we'll avenge it.

1653
01:41:10,452 --> 01:41:13,488
如果你和他们翻脸了
How will your friends have time for me

1654
01:41:13,622 --> 01:41:15,412
还会有时间对付我吗？
when they are so busy fighting you?

1655
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:23,870
通常会成功的
This usually works.

1656
01:41:24,007 --> 01:41:26,842
发挥失常，不算稀奇
Well, performance issues, it's not uncommon.

1657
01:41:26,969 --> 01:41:28,877
五个男人就有一个不举
One out of five...

1658
01:41:30,347 --> 01:41:30,888
佐维斯，行了吧
Jarvis, anytime now.

1659
01:41:30,889 --> 01:41:33,261
佐维斯，行了吧
Jarvis, anytime now.

1660
01:41:35,018 --> 01:41:37,769
你们将臣服于我
You will all fall before me.

1661
01:41:37,896 --> 01:41:39,271
启动
Deploy!

1662
01:41:39,398 --> 01:41:40,808
启动
Deploy!

1663
01:41:42,014 --> 01:41:43,307


1664
01:42:04,328 --> 01:42:06,330


1665
01:42:08,010 --> 01:42:10,963
你还得罪了另一个人
And there's one other person you pissed off.

1666
01:42:12,097 --> 01:42:13,341
他叫费尔
His name was Phil.

1667
01:42:14,421 --> 01:42:15,964


1668
01:42:37,122 --> 01:42:38,615
不妙了
Right.

1669
01:42:38,749 --> 01:42:39,993
敌军来了
Army.

1670
01:42:44,243 --> 01:42:45,619


1671
01:43:02,386 --> 01:43:04,596


1672
01:43:07,307 --> 01:43:09,017


1673
01:43:22,573 --> 01:43:24,449


1674
01:43:26,285 --> 01:43:27,536


1675
01:43:34,459 --> 01:43:36,128


1676
01:43:52,363 --> 01:43:53,643
洛基！
Loki!

1677
01:43:53,781 --> 01:43:55,820
关闭立方，否则我就摧毁它
Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it.

1678
01:43:55,950 --> 01:43:56,980
你摧毁不了的
You can't.

1679
01:43:57,118 --> 01:43:58,991
大局已定
There is no stopping it.

1680
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:00,910
唯有
There is only

1681
01:44:01,038 --> 01:44:02,152
开战
the war.

1682
01:44:02,290 --> 01:44:03,403
放马过来
So be it.

1683
01:44:03,322 --> 01:44:04,948


1684
01:44:09,411 --> 01:44:10,412


1685
01:44:16,168 --> 01:44:17,169


1686
01:44:19,671 --> 01:44:21,423


1687
01:44:25,521 --> 01:44:27,264
史塔，我们在你三点钟方向，朝东北来
Stark, we're on your three, headed northeast.

1688
01:44:27,398 --> 01:44:29,520
什么？你们路上还有闲情用膳？
What? Did you stop for drive-through?

1689
01:44:29,650 --> 01:44:31,357
快到帕克街，我会引敌人过来
Swing up Park. I'm going to lay them out for you.

1690
01:44:34,728 --> 01:44:35,729


1691
01:44:44,863 --> 01:44:46,031


1692
01:44:49,420 --> 01:44:50,748
长官，又多了一批
Sir, we have more incoming.

1693
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:52,622
行，别让他们消停
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

1694
01:44:56,083 --> 01:44:57,709


1695
01:44:59,514 --> 01:45:01,386
- 娜塔莎？ - 我看到他了
- Nat? - I see him.

1696
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:04,383


1697
01:45:09,763 --> 01:45:10,764


1698
01:45:14,434 --> 01:45:15,727


1699
01:45:18,855 --> 01:45:20,399


1700
01:45:36,248 --> 01:45:37,916


1701
01:45:45,727 --> 01:45:47,932
我们得回到上面
We got to get back up there.

1702
01:45:49,886 --> 01:45:51,763


1703
01:46:04,735 --> 01:46:06,695


1704
01:46:35,682 --> 01:46:36,683


1705
01:46:39,279 --> 01:46:40,938
史塔，看到了吗？
Stark, are you seeing this?

1706
01:46:41,698 --> 01:46:44,153
看到了，难以置信
Seeing.Still working on believing.

1707
01:46:44,284 --> 01:46:45,658
班纳呢？来了吗？
Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?

1708
01:46:45,786 --> 01:46:46,816
班纳？
Banner?

1709
01:46:46,953 --> 01:46:47,984
有进展就告诉我
Just keep me posted.

1710
01:46:48,705 --> 01:46:50,863
佐维斯，找出它们的弱点
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

1711
01:46:53,126 --> 01:46:54,999
看这
Look at this!

1712
01:46:55,128 --> 01:46:56,123
看你周围
Look around you!

1713
01:46:57,130 --> 01:47:00,997
这场混乱会随着你的统治而告终吗？
You think this madness will end with your rule?

1714
01:47:01,134 --> 01:47:02,627
太迟了
It's too late.

1715
01:47:04,137 --> 01:47:05,381
为时已晚
It's too late to stop it.

1716
01:47:05,514 --> 01:47:09,380
只要我们齐心，就能做到
No. We can, together.

1717
01:47:11,968 --> 01:47:13,053


1718
01:47:15,982 --> 01:47:18,104
你又感情用事
Sentiment.

1719
01:47:19,726 --> 01:47:20,936


1720
01:47:23,688 --> 01:47:24,481


1721
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:48,216
仍有一些市民困在这里
We've got civilians still trapped up here.

1722
01:47:49,391 --> 01:47:50,386
洛基
Loki.

1723
01:47:50,882 --> 01:47:52,217


1724
01:48:02,028 --> 01:48:03,819
这些人需要帮助
They're fish in a barrel down there.

1725
01:48:09,286 --> 01:48:11,242
这里交给我们，去吧
We got this. It's good. Go.

1726
01:48:11,371 --> 01:48:12,745
你们能牵制他们？
Do you think you can hold them off?

1727
01:48:12,873 --> 01:48:13,867
队长
Captain,

1728
01:48:15,876 --> 01:48:18,710
乐意之极
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1729
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:38,430


1730
01:48:41,016 --> 01:48:42,893


1731
01:48:45,571 --> 01:48:47,278
令我想起在布达佩斯的情形
Just like Budapest all over again.

1732
01:48:47,907 --> 01:48:50,397
看来你我对布达佩斯的印象大不相同
You and I remember Budapest very differently.

1733
01:49:06,550 --> 01:49:08,956
国民兵要一小时后才到达
It's going to be an hour before they can scramble the National Guard.

1734
01:49:09,095 --> 01:49:10,885
国民兵？
National Guard?

1735
01:49:11,847 --> 01:49:13,341
军方了解这里的情况吗？
Does the army know what's happening here?

1736
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:14,594
我们了解吗？
Do we?

1737
01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:17,007
派人进去这几栋楼
You need men in these buildings.

1738
01:49:17,144 --> 01:49:19,968
里面的人处境危险
There are people inside and they're going to be running right into the line of fire.

1739
01:49:20,106 --> 01:49:22,014
你们保护他们到地下室或者地铁
You take them to the basements or through the subway.

1740
01:49:22,149 --> 01:49:23,726
不要出现在街面上
You keep them off the streets.

1741
01:49:23,859 --> 01:49:26,480
封锁这里至第39街
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

1742
01:49:26,612 --> 01:49:28,236
为什么要听你指挥？
Why the hell should I take orders from you?

1743
01:49:42,294 --> 01:49:43,491
派人进去这几栋楼
I need men in those buildings.

1744
01:49:43,629 --> 01:49:45,704
带他们离开街面
Lead the people down and away from the streets.

1745
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:48,412
封锁这里至第39街
We're going to set up a perimeter all the way down to 39th Street.

1746
01:49:57,342 --> 01:49:58,510


1747
01:49:58,811 --> 01:50:00,388
吸引它注意了
Well, we got its attention.

1748
01:50:00,521 --> 01:50:02,394
下一步呢？
What the hell was step two?

1749
01:50:04,057 --> 01:50:06,101


1750
01:50:07,852 --> 01:50:08,770


1751
01:50:08,853 --> 01:50:10,230


1752
01:50:14,818 --> 01:50:16,194


1753
01:50:25,245 --> 01:50:26,997


1754
01:50:31,927 --> 01:50:32,922
上面情况如何？
What's the story upstairs?

1755
01:50:33,054 --> 01:50:34,962
无法穿透立方周围的能量罩
The power surrounding the Cube is impenetrable.

1756
01:50:35,097 --> 01:50:37,718
托尔说得对，先干掉这些家伙
Thor's right. We got to deal with these guys.

1757
01:50:37,850 --> 01:50:39,474
- 怎么做？ - 大家一起做
- How do we do this? - As a team.

1758
01:50:39,602 --> 01:50:40,881
我还要找洛基算账呢
I have unfinished business with Loki.

1759
01:50:41,437 --> 01:50:42,467
轮着来，别插队啊
Yeah? Well, get in line.

1760
01:50:42,605 --> 01:50:43,600
省省吧
Save it.

1761
01:50:43,731 --> 01:50:45,058
洛基会集中火力于我们
Loki's going to keep this fight focused on us,

1762
01:50:45,191 --> 01:50:46,221
正好如此
and that's what we need.

1763
01:50:46,358 --> 01:50:48,017
没有他，这些怪物会乱阵脚
Without him, these things could run wild.

1764
01:50:48,152 --> 01:50:51,105
史塔在上面，他需要我们…
We got Stark up top. He's going to need us to...

1765
01:50:49,894 --> 01:50:50,937


1766
01:50:58,454 --> 01:51:02,237
挺混乱的
So, this all seems horrible.

1767
01:51:02,708 --> 01:51:03,822
我见过更混乱的
I've seen worse.

1768
01:51:04,376 --> 01:51:05,371
对不起
Sorry.

1769
01:51:05,503 --> 01:51:08,171
我们要将场面弄得更混乱些
No, we could use a little worse.

1770
01:51:08,297 --> 01:51:10,704
- 史塔，他来了 - 班纳吗？
- Stark, we got him. - Banner?

1771
01:51:10,841 --> 01:51:12,085
你猜对了
Just like you said.

1772
01:51:12,218 --> 01:51:14,921
叫他快变身，马上好戏开场
Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.

1773
01:51:20,425 --> 01:51:21,176


1774
01:51:21,394 --> 01:51:23,469
这不是好戏吧
I don't see how that's a party.

1775
01:51:31,319 --> 01:51:32,314
班纳博士
Dr. Banner.

1776
01:51:34,072 --> 01:51:35,862
是时候愤怒了
Now might be a really good time for you to get angry.

1777
01:51:36,908 --> 01:51:39,363
这就是我的秘诀，队长
That's my secret, Captain.

1778
01:51:41,079 --> 01:51:42,323
我总是在发怒
I'm always angry...

1779
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:55,423
撑住
Hold on!

1780
01:52:05,804 --> 01:52:07,639


1781
01:52:09,182 --> 01:52:10,350


1782
01:52:10,433 --> 01:52:12,435


1783
01:52:25,331 --> 01:52:26,873
倾巢出动
Send the rest.

1784
01:52:33,631 --> 01:52:34,875
大家
Guys.

1785
01:52:35,008 --> 01:52:36,205
请发号施令，队长
Call it, Captain.

1786
01:52:36,342 --> 01:52:37,504
听好
All right, listen up.

1787
01:52:37,635 --> 01:52:40,422
关闭传送门前，要牵制住局势
Until we can close that portal, our priority is containment.

1788
01:52:40,555 --> 01:52:41,882
巴顿，你到屋顶
Barton, I want you on that roof.

1789
01:52:42,015 --> 01:52:43,888
盯住局势，有异常马上报告
Eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays.

1790
01:52:44,017 --> 01:52:45,391
史塔，你负责封锁区
Stark, you got the perimeter.

1791
01:52:45,518 --> 01:52:46,680
有跑出三个街区的
Anything gets more than three blocks out,

1792
01:52:46,811 --> 01:52:48,352
你就把它抓回来或者消灭掉
you turn it back or you turn it to ash.

1793
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:49,677
- 能带我一程吗？- 没问题
- Can you give me a lift? - Right.

1794
01:52:49,814 --> 01:52:50,892
抓紧，神射手
Better clench up, Legolas.

1795
01:52:54,486 --> 01:52:56,857
托尔，你负责阻塞传送门
Thor, you got to try and bottleneck that portal.

1796
01:52:56,988 --> 01:52:58,150
拖慢敌军的行速
Slow them down.

1797
01:52:58,281 --> 01:53:00,438
用雷电杀敌
You got the lightning. Light the bastards up.

1798
01:53:02,744 --> 01:53:04,367
你和我就留守地面
You and me, we stay here on the ground.

1799
01:53:04,496 --> 01:53:05,526
继续作战
We keep the fighting here.

1800
01:53:05,663 --> 01:53:06,658
至于浩克
And Hulk...

1801
01:53:06,781 --> 01:53:07,991


1802
01:53:09,375 --> 01:53:10,454
给我砸
Smash.

1803
01:53:21,546 --> 01:53:22,964


1804
01:53:31,848 --> 01:53:34,934


1805
01:53:47,113 --> 01:53:48,531


1806
01:53:59,542 --> 01:54:01,920


1807
01:54:04,055 --> 01:54:05,169
长官
Sir.

1808
01:54:06,223 --> 01:54:07,218
理事会在线
The Council is on.

1809
01:54:12,104 --> 01:54:15,353
史塔，有很多敌人尾随你
Stark, you got a lot of strays sniffing your tail.

1810
01:54:17,192 --> 01:54:19,231
我只是不想他们到街面上
I'm just trying to keep them off the streets.

1811
01:54:19,361 --> 01:54:21,602
可是存太多又不值钱
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

1812
01:54:21,739 --> 01:54:22,900
找个急转弯
So find a tight corner.

1813
01:54:23,031 --> 01:54:24,359
收到
I will roger that.

1814
01:54:47,090 --> 01:54:48,299
好，伙计
Oh, boy.

1815
01:54:55,522 --> 01:54:57,146
好主意
Nice call.

1816
01:54:57,274 --> 01:54:58,471
还有别的招吗？
What else you got?

1817
01:54:58,609 --> 01:55:01,395
托尔在第六街与敌人作战
Thor is taking on a squadron down on Sixth.

1818
01:55:01,528 --> 01:55:03,734
竟敢不邀请我
And he didn't invite me.

1819
01:55:08,736 --> 01:55:10,321


1820
01:55:11,281 --> 01:55:12,782


1821
01:55:21,416 --> 01:55:23,209


1822
01:55:30,216 --> 01:55:31,884


1823
01:55:43,237 --> 01:55:44,860
队长，赶紧关上传送门
Captain, none of this is going to mean a damn thing

1824
01:55:44,988 --> 01:55:46,232
敌人太多了
if we don't close that portal.

1825
01:55:46,365 --> 01:55:48,024
用上巨炮也于事无补
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

1826
01:55:48,158 --> 01:55:50,399
或许不是枪炮的问题
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

1827
01:55:52,329 --> 01:55:54,285
想上去，你得有顺风车
If you want to get up there, you're going to need a ride.

1828
01:55:55,374 --> 01:55:56,452
找到顺风车了
I got a ride.

1829
01:55:57,584 --> 01:55:58,615
需要点助力
I could use a boost, though.

1830
01:56:01,213 --> 01:56:02,208
真要？
Are you sure about this?

1831
01:56:02,673 --> 01:56:05,210
会很好玩
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1832
01:56:20,892 --> 01:56:22,143


1833
01:56:32,244 --> 01:56:34,117
转弯
Okay, turn, turn.

1834
01:56:34,246 --> 01:56:35,988
慢点
Less! Less!

1835
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:10,733


1836
01:57:19,784 --> 01:57:21,411


1837
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:41,556


1838
01:57:47,937 --> 01:57:49,897


1839
01:57:51,524 --> 01:57:53,359


1840
01:57:52,259 --> 01:57:54,158
（中央火车站四十二大街站）

1841
01:57:55,153 --> 01:57:56,821


1842
01:57:58,704 --> 01:58:01,657
队长，42街过麦迪逊大道处的银行
Captain, the bank on 42nd past Madison.

1843
01:58:01,791 --> 01:58:03,533
有大批市民被困
They've cornered a lot of civilians in there.

1844
01:58:03,668 --> 01:58:05,576
我马上过来
I'm on it.

1845
01:58:07,540 --> 01:58:09,000


1846
01:58:10,084 --> 01:58:11,085


1847
01:58:16,174 --> 01:58:17,175


1848
01:58:23,055 --> 01:58:23,806


1849
01:58:25,690 --> 01:58:27,480
大家，快离开
Everyone! Clear out!

1850
01:58:27,477 --> 01:58:28,936


1851
01:58:32,523 --> 01:58:33,524


1852
01:58:57,388 --> 01:58:59,047
霍利局长
Director Fury,

1853
01:58:59,182 --> 01:59:00,972
理事会已作出决定
the Council has made a decision.

1854
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:03,851
知道了
I recognise the Council has made a decision.

1855
01:59:03,978 --> 01:59:05,555
肯定是个白痴决定
But given that it's a stupid-ass decision,

1856
01:59:05,688 --> 01:59:07,098
所以我选择无视
I have elected to ignore it.

1857
01:59:07,231 --> 01:59:10,564
局长，你最靠近战场
Director, you're closer than any of our subs.

1858
01:59:10,693 --> 01:59:11,688
你爬上飞机…
You scramble that jet...

1859
01:59:11,819 --> 01:59:14,523
那可是曼哈顿岛，议员们
That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman.

1860
01:59:14,655 --> 01:59:16,730
除非我的队伍阻挡不了
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

1861
01:59:16,866 --> 01:59:18,822
否则我不会下令发动核武攻击
I will not order a nuclear strike

1862
01:59:18,993 --> 01:59:20,403
来对付市民
against a civilian population.

1863
01:59:20,536 --> 01:59:22,943
如果真的制止不了，那就完蛋了
If we don't hold them here, we lose everything.

1864
01:59:23,081 --> 01:59:25,831
发动核武攻击才是真的完蛋
If I send that bird out, we already have.

1865
01:59:29,587 --> 01:59:31,294
是你
Oh, you.

1866
01:59:33,548 --> 01:59:34,710
鹰眼
Hawkeye!

1867
01:59:36,176 --> 01:59:37,171
娜塔莎，你干什么？
Nat, what are you doing?

1868
01:59:38,095 --> 01:59:39,089
帮下忙？
A little help?

1869
01:59:44,393 --> 01:59:45,387
没问题
I got him.

1870
01:59:56,274 --> 01:59:57,400


1871
02:00:00,778 --> 02:00:02,238


1872
02:00:05,283 --> 02:00:06,450


1873
02:00:07,910 --> 02:00:08,744


1874
02:00:11,962 --> 02:00:12,957
够了
Enough!

1875
02:00:13,296 --> 02:00:15,751
你们只不过是低等生物
You are, all of you, beneath me!

1876
02:00:15,882 --> 02:00:18,633
我是神明，愚蠢的生物
I am a god, you dull creature.

1877
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:20,253
我绝不妥协…
And I will not be bullied by...

1878
02:00:30,105 --> 02:00:31,978
弱神一个
Puny god.

1879
02:00:32,810 --> 02:00:34,604


1880
02:00:40,115 --> 02:00:41,573
权杖
The sceptre...

1881
02:00:42,743 --> 02:00:43,940
博士
Doctor.

1882
02:00:45,829 --> 02:00:48,663
洛基的权杖所拥有的力量
Loki's sceptre. The energy.

1883
02:00:48,790 --> 02:00:50,449
可以对付立方
The Tesseract can't fight,

1884
02:00:50,584 --> 02:00:52,622
因为彼此的力量是同类
but you can't protect against yourself.

1885
02:00:52,753 --> 02:00:53,747
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

1886
02:00:53,879 --> 02:00:55,123
你当时不知道自己在做什么
You didn't know what you were doing.

1887
02:00:58,175 --> 02:01:00,332
其实我是知道的
Actually, I think I did.

1888
02:01:00,469 --> 02:01:03,422
我设立了安全罩，以便切断能量源
I built in a safety to cut their power source.

1889
02:01:04,639 --> 02:01:06,049
洛基的权杖
Loki's sceptre.

1890
02:01:06,183 --> 02:01:08,755
应该可以关闭传送门
It may be able to close the portal.

1891
02:01:10,854 --> 02:01:13,011
它就近在眼前
And I'm looking right at it.

1892
02:01:14,018 --> 02:01:15,686


1893
02:01:24,993 --> 02:01:28,860
先生，我们的能量会在穿透护甲前用尽
Sir, we will lose power before we penetrate that shell.

1894
02:01:35,504 --> 02:01:38,788
佐维斯，听过约拿的故事吗？
Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

1895
02:01:38,924 --> 02:01:41,295
约拿可不是好榜样
I wouldn't consider him a role model.

1896
02:01:43,923 --> 02:01:45,049


1897
02:01:51,222 --> 02:01:52,390


1898
02:02:24,130 --> 02:02:25,506


1899
02:02:29,677 --> 02:02:32,555


1900
02:02:42,273 --> 02:02:43,941


1901
02:02:48,029 --> 02:02:50,114


1902
02:02:50,911 --> 02:02:52,702
霍利局长不再有话事权
Director Fury is no longer in command.

1903
02:02:52,830 --> 02:02:54,868
优先执行7A11
Override order 7-Alpha-1-1.

1904
02:02:54,999 --> 02:02:57,571
7A11,已确认，准备起飞
7-Alpha-1-1, confirmed. We're go for takeoff.

1905
02:02:58,461 --> 02:03:00,536
有飞机起飞
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

1906
02:03:01,047 --> 02:03:03,038
甲板上的人注意，有飞机擅自起飞
Anyone on the deck, we have a rogue bird.

1907
02:03:03,174 --> 02:03:04,453
拦截下来
We need to shut it down!

1908
02:03:04,592 --> 02:03:06,797
重复，行动未经许可
Repeat, takeoff is not authorised.

1909
02:03:37,333 --> 02:03:39,490
史塔，听到吗？
Stark, do you hear me?

1910
02:03:39,627 --> 02:03:41,749
有导弹直奔市中心
You have a missile headed straight for the city.

1911
02:03:42,296 --> 02:03:43,670
还有多久？
How long?

1912
02:03:43,798 --> 02:03:45,873
最多三分钟
Three minutes, max.

1913
02:03:46,008 --> 02:03:47,632
导弹会夷平市中心
The payload will wipe out Midtown.

1914
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:49,798
佐维斯，将所有能量注入推进器
Jarvis, put everything we got into the thrusters.

1915
02:03:49,929 --> 02:03:51,588
完成了
I just did.

1916
02:04:04,485 --> 02:04:05,812
发射完毕
Package is sent.

1917
02:04:05,945 --> 02:04:09,064
两分三十秒后会爆炸
Detonation in 2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.

1918
02:04:17,868 --> 02:04:18,911


1919
02:04:26,794 --> 02:04:27,795


1920
02:04:31,846 --> 02:04:34,217
有能力再战一回吗？
Are you ready for another bout?

1921
02:04:34,890 --> 02:04:35,921
怎么，你累了？
What, are you getting sleepy?

1922
02:04:41,522 --> 02:04:43,264
对准上端
Right at the crown!

1923
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,070
我能关掉传送门
I can close it.

1924
02:04:51,198 --> 02:04:53,237
有人听到吗
Can anybody copy?

1925
02:04:53,367 --> 02:04:54,481
我能关掉传送门
I can shut the portal down.

1926
02:04:54,618 --> 02:04:56,657
- 赶快 - 等下
- Do it! - No, wait.

1927
02:04:56,786 --> 02:04:58,030
史塔，敌军不断攻入
Stark, these things are still coming.

1928
02:04:58,163 --> 02:04:59,157
有颗导弹正奔过来
I got a nuke coming in.

1929
02:04:59,289 --> 02:05:01,197
会在一分钟内爆炸
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

1930
02:05:10,884 --> 02:05:12,710
我找到绝佳的爆炸场所
And I know just where to put it.

1931
02:05:19,893 --> 02:05:22,264
史塔，你有去无回
Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.

1932
02:05:22,395 --> 02:05:23,770
剩下的能量用来上升，佐维斯
Save the rest for the turn, J.

1933
02:05:23,897 --> 02:05:27,976
先生，要不要致电宝芝小姐？
Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?

1934
02:05:28,109 --> 02:05:30,148
也好
Might as well.

1935
02:05:32,072 --> 02:05:34,443
纽约市的街道变成了战场
The streets of New York City have become a battleground.

1936
02:05:34,574 --> 02:05:37,278
军方试图牵制敌方
The Army is here trying to contain the violence

1937
02:05:37,410 --> 02:05:38,868
不过实力悬殊
- but clearly, it is outmatched.

1938
02:05:38,995 --> 02:05:41,283
不得不说，鄙人多年新闻报道中
And I have to say, in all my years of reporting,

1939
02:05:41,414 --> 02:05:44,331
亦未曾见过如斯情形
I have never seen anything like this.

1940
02:05:44,459 --> 02:05:45,952
我方战斗小组的资料有限
We have limited information on the team

1941
02:05:46,086 --> 02:05:49,833
不过据知有亿万富翁史塔的钢铁侠
but we do know that billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...

1942
02:05:58,719 --> 02:06:00,054


1943
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:13,317


1944
02:06:26,576 --> 02:06:28,155
（呼叫小辣椒失败）
(JARVIS POWERING DOWN)

1945
02:06:47,309 --> 02:06:48,352


1946
02:07:03,163 --> 02:07:04,988
快呀，史塔
Come on, Stark.

1947
02:07:06,036 --> 02:07:07,663


1948
02:07:11,629 --> 02:07:12,743
关掉
Close it.

1949
02:07:32,817 --> 02:07:33,812
臭小子
Son of a gun.

1950
02:07:38,572 --> 02:07:40,196
他没有减速
He's not slowing down.

1951
02:07:58,258 --> 02:07:59,716
还有呼吸吗？
Is he breathing?

1952
02:08:21,278 --> 02:08:22,780


1953
02:08:25,616 --> 02:08:26,742


1954
02:08:27,579 --> 02:08:28,989
怎么了？
What the hell?

1955
02:08:31,709 --> 02:08:33,830
干嘛？
What just happened?

1956
02:08:33,961 --> 02:08:36,249
不要告诉我，没人给我做人工呼吸
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

1957
02:08:40,551 --> 02:08:42,210
我们打赢了
We won.

1958
02:08:42,841 --> 02:08:43,842


1959
02:08:44,555 --> 02:08:45,834
太好了
All right, yay!

1960
02:08:45,973 --> 02:08:47,929
干得好
Hurray. Good job, guys.

1961
02:08:48,058 --> 02:08:51,260
明天不上班，休假一天吧
Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day.

1962
02:08:52,146 --> 02:08:53,722
吃过土耳其烤肉吗?
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1963
02:08:54,148 --> 02:08:56,435
离这里两个街口有档土耳其烤肉
There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here.

1964
02:08:56,567 --> 02:08:58,226
虽然不清楚，但是我想试试
I don't know what it is, but I want to try it.

1965
02:08:58,652 --> 02:09:00,110
事情还没结束
We're not finished yet.

1966
02:09:05,075 --> 02:09:07,197
那就稍后再吃烤肉
And then shawarma after.

1967
02:09:11,912 --> 02:09:13,831


1968
02:09:28,849 --> 02:09:31,090
如果你们不介意
If it's all the same to you,

1969
02:09:34,396 --> 02:09:36,055
我想喝杯酒
I'll have that drink now.

1970
02:09:43,947 --> 02:09:47,823
此次灾难事件已确认为外星人袭击事件
Despite the devastation of what has been confirmed as an extraterrestrial attack,

1971
02:09:47,951 --> 02:09:49,493
一班天赋异禀人士
the extraordinary heroics

1972
02:09:49,620 --> 02:09:51,576
组成的复仇者联盟团队
of the group known as the Avengers

1973
02:09:51,705 --> 02:09:53,246
不但慰藉民心
has been to many a cause not only for comfort,

1974
02:09:53,374 --> 02:09:54,368
更被津津乐道
but for celebration.

1975
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:58,834
有这样的人士守护我们，太好了
It's just really great knowing they're out there.That someone is watching over us.

1976
02:09:58,962 --> 02:10:00,159
我爱你，雷神托尔
I love you, Thor!

1977
02:10:00,297 --> 02:10:02,004
然后这些家伙…
And then these guys were like...

1978
02:10:02,132 --> 02:10:03,460
然后天空变得…
And then the air goes...

1979
02:10:03,592 --> 02:10:04,966
接着绿巨人走过来…
And this green guy walks up and he goes...

1980
02:10:05,094 --> 02:10:06,124
不知道
I don't know.

1981
02:10:06,261 --> 02:10:08,716
我并不觉得安全
I don't exactly feel safer with those things out there.

1982
02:10:08,847 --> 02:10:11,931
政府似乎有所隐瞒
It just seems that there's a lot they're not telling us.

1983
02:10:12,059 --> 02:10:15,474
超级英雄在纽约？别闹了
Superheroes in New York? Give me a break.

1984
02:10:15,604 --> 02:10:17,512
这般所谓的英雄
These so-called "heroes"

1985
02:10:17,648 --> 02:10:21,223
要对这所城市遭受的破坏负责
have to be held responsible for the destruction done to this city.

1986
02:10:21,359 --> 02:10:23,481
这是他们造成的，他们去哪了？
This was their fight. Where are they now?

1987
02:10:24,112 --> 02:10:26,436
尽管大家对这些英雄疑问多多
Tough questions are being asked about the Avengers themselves.

1988
02:10:26,572 --> 02:10:27,567
他们从天而降
Their sudden appearance

1989
02:10:27,698 --> 02:10:29,073
又突然消失
and equally sudden disappearance...

1990
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:31,986
这也归咎于他们吗？
What, this is all somehow their fault?

1991
02:10:34,038 --> 02:10:37,204
美国队长救了我
Captain America saved my life.

1992
02:10:39,335 --> 02:10:42,833
无论他在哪里，无论他们在哪
Wherever he is, and wherever any of them are,

1993
02:10:42,964 --> 02:10:44,457
我只想…
I would just...

1994
02:10:45,258 --> 02:10:47,545
我只想道声谢
I would want to say thank you.

1995
02:10:50,012 --> 02:10:51,506
复仇者们去哪了？
Where are the Avengers?

1996
02:10:51,639 --> 02:10:54,046
我目前没追查他们的行踪
I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts.

1997
02:10:54,183 --> 02:10:56,341
但他们应该休息下
I'd say they've earned a leave of absence.

1998
02:10:56,477 --> 02:10:58,054
至于宇宙立方？
And the Tesseract?

1999
02:10:58,187 --> 02:11:00,428
立方回去了属于它的地方
The Tesseract is where it belongs.

2000
02:11:00,857 --> 02:11:03,181
一个我们去不到的地方
Out of our reach.

2001
02:11:03,317 --> 02:11:04,859
你无权话事
That's not your call.

2002
02:11:04,986 --> 02:11:06,016
我可没做什么
I didn't make it.

2003
02:11:06,154 --> 02:11:08,394
我只是遵循神的旨意
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

2004
02:11:08,531 --> 02:11:10,321
可你让他带走
So, you let him take it

2005
02:11:10,450 --> 02:11:12,073
至于战犯洛基
and the war criminal, Loki,

2006
02:11:12,201 --> 02:11:13,908
他应该为所犯下的负责
who should be answering for his crime.

2007
02:11:14,036 --> 02:11:16,609
他会的
Oh, I think he will be.

2008
02:11:30,094 --> 02:11:32,763
你根本不知道你在做什么
I don't think you understand what you've started,

2009
02:11:32,889 --> 02:11:35,343
对复仇者们放任不管
letting the Avengers loose on this world.

2010
02:11:35,892 --> 02:11:36,886
他们很危险的
They're dangerous.

2011
02:11:37,018 --> 02:11:40,682
全世界都知道
They surely are, and the whole world knows it.

2012
02:11:41,230 --> 02:11:43,803
全宇宙都知道
Every world knows it.

2013
02:11:44,233 --> 02:11:46,308
这就是你的目的？
Was that the point of all this?

2014
02:11:46,444 --> 02:11:48,186
声明？
A statement?

2015
02:11:50,907 --> 02:11:52,364
保证？
A promise.

2016
02:12:01,084 --> 02:12:02,625
长官，下一步怎么做？
Sir, how does it work now?

2017
02:12:03,753 --> 02:12:05,744
他们各奔天涯了
They've gone their separate ways.

2018
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:08,797
有些还跑得相当远
Some, pretty extremely far.

2019
02:12:09,550 --> 02:12:11,459
如果再发生类似事件
If we get into a situation like this again,

2020
02:12:11,594 --> 02:12:13,135
要怎么办
what happens then?

2021
02:12:13,262 --> 02:12:14,257
他们会回来的
They'll come back.

2022
02:12:15,765 --> 02:12:17,472
你肯定？
Are you really sure about that?

2023
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:18,595
没错
I am.

2024
02:12:20,228 --> 02:12:21,425
何以见得？
Why?

2025
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:24,685
因为我们需要他们回来
Because we'll need them to.

2026
02:12:40,621 --> 02:12:42,372


2027
02:15:16,278 --> 02:15:18,768
人类
Humans.

2028
02:15:20,073 --> 02:15:24,402
并非我们想象中那么弱小
They are not the cowering wretches we were promised.

2029
02:15:25,370 --> 02:15:27,528
他们意志坚定
They stand.

2030
02:15:28,373 --> 02:15:34,825
桀骜不驯，因而难以奴役
They are unruly, and therefore cannot be ruled.

2031
02:15:41,803 --> 02:15:44,673
挑衅人类
To challenge them

2032
02:15:44,805 --> 02:15:48,505
等同自寻死路
is to court death.

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We are 22 jump points out of Asgard.

12
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,610
我们的船员均是阿斯加德的家庭成员
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Our crew is made up of Asgardian families.

13
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,360

17
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,810
被伟大的泰坦神所拯救
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You have had the privilege

18
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,560
是你们莫大的荣幸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}of being saved by the Great Titan.

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,690

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You may think this is suffering.

20

不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No.

21

这是救赎
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It is salvation.

23
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,700
宇宙才趋于平衡

24
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,830
微笑吧

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I know what it's like to lose.

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,360
明知自己没有错 却还是失败了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}To feel so desperately that you're right...

29
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,740
这种绝望的感觉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}yet to fail, nonetheless.

30
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,540
很可怕
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's frightening.

31
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,750
让人不寒而栗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Turns the legs to jelly.

32
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,170
但我想问问你 结局会如何
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But I ask you, to what end?

33
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,180
畏惧还是逃避
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Dread it, run from it...

34
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,640
命运终会降临
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}destiny arrives all the same.

35
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,680
而现在 它已在眼前
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And now, it's here.

36
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,230
或者我应该说
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Or should I say...

37
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,110
我已在你面前
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am.

38
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,740
你废话太多了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You talk too much.

39
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,820
超能立方
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The Tesseract.

40
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,120
还是你哥哥的人头
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Or your brother's head.

41
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,170
我相信你已经选好了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I assume you have a preference.

42
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,670
噢 当然了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, I do.

43
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,130
想杀就杀吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Kill away.

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,440
够了 住手
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All right, stop!

45
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,240
我们没有超能立方
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We don't have the Tesseract.

46
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,860
它已经在阿斯加德被毁掉了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It was destroyed on Asgard.

47
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,630
你真是史上最差劲的弟弟
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You really are the worst brother.

48
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,720
我向你保证 哥哥
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I assure you, brother...

49
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,800
太阳会再次照耀我们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the sun will shine on us again.

50
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,930
你过于乐观了 阿斯加德人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.

51
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,020
我要声明一点 我不是阿斯加德人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian.

52
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,230
还有一点呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And for another...

53
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,820
我们有浩克
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}we have a Hulk.

54
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,830
让他玩
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Let him have his fun.

55
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,630
天父啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Allfathers...

56
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,720
让黑魔法再一次流经我的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}let the dark magic flow through me one last...

57
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,680

58
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,910
你这就不对了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That was a mistake.

59
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,580
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No!

60
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,390
你要为此偿命
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're going to die for that.

61
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,640
嘘
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Shh.

62
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,400
我谦虚的个体
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}My humble personage...

63

64
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,910
任何人都不曾享有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No other being has ever had the might...

65
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,950
使用哪怕一颗无限原石的尊崇
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}nay, the nobility...

66
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,710
更不用说两颗了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones.

67
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,630
宇宙臣服于您的掌下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The universe lies within your grasp.

68
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,630
地球上还有两颗原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}There are two more stones on Earth.

69
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,850
我的孩子们啊 去找到它们 给我带回泰坦星
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan.

70
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,510

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Father, we will not fail you.

71
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,020
请容我打断一下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If I might interject.

72
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,190
如果要去地球 或许你们需要一位导游
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If you're going to Earth, you might want a guide.

73
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,020
我确实在那片舞台上有过演出经历
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I do have a bit of experience in that arena.

74
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,530
你说的是失败的经历吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If you consider failure experience.

75
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,150
我说的是实战经历
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I consider experience experience.

76

全能的神灭霸啊

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

78
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,880
奥丁之子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Odinson...

81
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,680
在此向您献上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}do hereby pledge to you...

82
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,890
我永生的忠诚
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}my undying fidelity.

83
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,940
永生
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Undying?

84
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,950
你应该谨慎措辞
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You should choose your words more carefully.

85
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,930
你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You...

86
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,730
永远不可能成为
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}will never be...

87
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,610
神
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}a god.

88
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,830
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No!

89
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,220
这次你可没有复活的机会了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No resurrections this time.

90
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,030
不 洛基
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No. Loki.

91
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,950
讲真 你一分钱都没有吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Seriously, you don't have any money?

92
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,120
迷恋物质意味着精神空虚
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.

93
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,710
我会转告便利店小哥的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'll tell the guys at the deli.

94
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,710
他们会给你做一个抽象的黑麦火腿三明治
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye.

95
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,710
噢 等等 我好像有200块钱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh. Wait, wait, wait. I think I have 200.

96
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,880

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, buck and a half.

99
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,130

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What do you want?

100
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,260
我想吃金枪鱼三明治哎
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.

101
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,820
灭霸来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos is coming.

108
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,170
慢点 慢点 我一字一句地跟你说清楚
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Slow down, slow down. I'll spell it out for you.

109
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,340
你就是在胡言乱语
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're totally rambling.

110
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,250
-不 我没有 -你把我说糊涂了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- No, I'm not. - You lost me.

111
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,710
听着 就是你有没有做过一种梦
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Look, you know how you're having a dream,

112
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,920
梦里你急着想要尿尿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and in the dream you gotta pee.

113
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,090
-继续 -好
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Yeah. - Okay.

114
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,050
然后你就会想 "我的天呐
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And then you're like, "Oh, my God.

115
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,430
没有卫生间 我要怎么办啊"
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}"There's no bathrooms. What am I gonna do?

116
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,720
-"哦 有人在看着呢" -是哦
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- "Oh, someone's watching." - Right.

117
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,760
"我要尿裤子了"
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}"Oh, I'm gonna go in my pants."

118
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,930
然后你从梦中醒来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And then you wake up and in real life

119
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,010
确实想要尿尿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you actually have to pee.

120
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,100
-没错 -有过这样的梦
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Yes. - Yeah.

121
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,310
-嗯 -谁都做过这样的梦
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Okay. - Everybody has that.

122
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,350
没错 这就是我要说的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Right, that's the point I'm trying to make.

123
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,360
恰恰就是昨晚 我梦见我们有了孩子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Apropos of that, last night I dreamt we had a kid.

124
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,480
感觉太真实了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It was so real.

125
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,030
我们用你怪叔叔的名字给他取名
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We named him after your eccentric uncle.

126
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,150
呃 他叫什么来着
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, what was his name?

127
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,490
-哎 -摩根 对
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Right. - Morgan! Morgan.

128
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,320
-所以你一觉醒来 -自然醒
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- So you woke up... - Naturally.

129
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,120
觉得我们应该
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}...and thought that we were...

130
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,280
-生个孩子 -好吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Expecting. - Yeah.

131
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,160
-可以吗 -不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Yes? - No.

132
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,000
我做了这个梦 那么真实
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I had a dream about it. It was so real.

133
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
如果你真的想要孩子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If you wanted to have a kid...

134
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,080
就不会天天戴着这个了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you wouldn't have done that.

135
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,130
既然你提起来了 我可以跟你说 这没什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing.

136
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,790
只是个放纳米颗粒的东西罢了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's just a housing unit for nanoparticles.

137
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,170
你这么说可一点帮助都没有 好吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're not helping your case, okay?

138
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,420
不 这是可以拆掉的 这不是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, this is detachable. It's not a...

139
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,260
你不需要这个
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You don't need that.

140
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,380
我知道 我做过手术了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I know, I had the surgery.

141
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,800
我只是想保护你我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm just trying to protect us...

142
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,430
和未来的一家三口 仅此而已
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and future usses and that's it.

143
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,140
万一衣柜里面有个怪物呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Just in case there's a monster in the closet.

144
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,100
-而不是 你懂的 -正常的衣服
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Instead of, you know... - Shirts.

145
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,270
你真的太了解我了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know me so well.

146
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,480
-天呐 -你把我要说的话都说了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- God. - You finish all my sentences.

147
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,360
你的衣柜里应该挂满正常的衣服
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You should have shirts in your closet.

148
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,530
是呀
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah.

149
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,440
你知道还差什么吗 不再有意外
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know what there should be? No more surprises.

150
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,950
我们今晚要共进晚餐
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight.

151
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,070
去炫耀一下这枚海瑞温斯顿的钻戒
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Show off this Harry Winston.

152
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,490
对吧 我们不要再经历任何意外了 永远不要
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever.

153
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,830
我应该向你保证
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I should promise you.

154
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,080
-是的 -我会的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Yes. - I will.

155
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,540
谢谢你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thank you.

156
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,750
托尼·史塔克
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tony Stark.

157
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,000
我是斯蒂芬·斯特兰奇博士 你得跟我走一趟
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me.

158
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,840
噢 对了 顺便祝你们新婚快乐
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way.

159
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,800
不好意思 我给你发过请帖吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sorry, you giving out tickets to something?

160
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,970
我们需要你的帮助
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We need your help.

161
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,510
毫不夸张地说
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's not overselling it to say that

162
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,310
宇宙的命运现在悬于一线
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the fate of the universe is at stake.

163
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,850
"我们"是谁
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And who's "We"?

164
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,810
嘿 托尼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey, Tony.

165
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:12,940
布鲁斯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Bruce.

166
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,440
-佩珀 -嗨
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Pepper. - Hi.

167
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,150
-噢 -你还好吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Oh. - You okay?

168
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,200
在宇宙形成之初
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}At the dawn of the universe,

169
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,160
世界一片混沌 之后
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}there was nothing. Then...

170
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,330
嘭
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Boom.

171
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,910
宇宙大爆炸形成了六颗元素水晶
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals...

172
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,790
划过原始的宇宙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}hurtling across the virgin universe.

173
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,340
这些无限原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}These Infinity Stones

174
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,260
每一颗控制着一种本质的力量
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}each control an essential aspect of existence.

175
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,380
空间
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Space.

176
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,800
现实
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Reality.

177
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,430
力量
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Power.

178
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,930
灵魂
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Soul.

179
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,180
心灵
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Mind.

180
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,310
还有时间
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And Time.

181
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,240
再跟我说一遍他的名字
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tell me his name again.

182
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,570
灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos.

183
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,080
他就是灾难 托尼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He's a plague, Tony.

184
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,080
他侵略了无数星球 烧杀掠夺
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He invades planets. He takes what he wants.

185
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,330
他灭掉了一半的人口
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He wipes out half the population.

186
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,580
是他让洛基来的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He sent Loki.

187
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,540
纽约的那次袭击 他就是始作俑者
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The attack on New York, that's him.

188
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,300
原来如此
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This is it.

189
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,420
我们还有多少时间
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What's our timeline?

190
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,010
不知道 他已经拥有了力量和空间原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones.

191
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,930
这让他成了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That already makes him

192
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,640
全宇宙最为强大的人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the strongest creature in the whole universe.

193
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,180
如果他得到了六颗原石 托尼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If he gets his hands on all six stones, Tony...

194
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,310
他可以摧毁任何生命
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He could destroy life

195
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,480
规模之大我们无法想象
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

196
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,480
你竟然也会说"无法想象"
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Did you seriously just say "Hitherto undreamt of"?

197
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,650
你竟然靠着宇宙大锅在拉筋
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

198
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,270
你说这是什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Is that what it is?

199
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,990
我宽宏大量不跟你计较
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm going to allow that.

200
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,620
如果灭霸要集齐六颗原石 那我们为什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just

201
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,240
不把你的这颗毁了呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}stick this one down a garbage disposal?

202
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,450
这绝不可行
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No can do.

203
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,290
我们曾立誓用生命守护时间原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone with our lives.

204
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,540
我还立誓要戒了冰激凌呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And I swore off dairy...

205
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,170
谁知道后来班杰瑞用我的名字命名了一款口味
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}but then Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me.

206
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,670
-史塔克狂热榛仁 -味道不错啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Stark Raving Hazelnuts. - Not bad.

207
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,290
有点腻了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A bit chalky.

208
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,090
大块浩克热巧克力是我们的最爱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A Hunk of Hulk of Burning Fudge is our favorite.

209
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,260
-真有这个东西 -随你便吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- That's a thing? - Whatever.

210
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,340
重点是 事情已经变了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Point is, things change.

211
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,470
我们保护时间原石的誓言是不会变的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change.

212
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,640
而且这颗原石可能是我们对付灭霸的唯一有利机会
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And this stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.

213
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,510
是啊 但是反过来说
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, so conversely,

214
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,640
如果我们不做好本职工作
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}it may also be his best chance against us.

215
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,310
这也可能是他对付我们的最好机会
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Well, if we don't do our jobs.

216
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,350
话说你到底是做什么的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What is your job exactly?

217
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,060
除了捏个动物气球以外
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Besides making balloon animals.

218
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,940
保护你们的现世 混球
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Protecting your reality, douchebag.

219
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,480
好了 各位 我们能不能先不吵架
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay, guys. Could we table this discussion right now?

220
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,440
好在我们有一颗原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The fact is we have this stone.

221
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,150
我们知道它在哪儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We know where it is.

222
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,570
幻视戴着心灵原石还不知道在哪儿呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone...

223
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,330
我们得尽快找到他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and we have to find him now.

224
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,580
我说的就是这件事
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, that's the thing.

225
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,580
什么意思
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What do you mean?

226
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,120
两周前 幻视关闭了他的通讯器
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder.

227
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,290
他失踪了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He's offline.

228
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,630
-什么 -你没听错
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- What? - Yeah.

229
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,670
托尼 你又弄丢了一个超级机器人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tony, you lost another super-bot?

230
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,210
我没有弄丢 他也不是机器人 他在进化
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.

231
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,590
那谁能找到幻视
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Who could find Vision then?

232
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,340
该死
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Shit.

233
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,470
或许史蒂夫·罗杰斯可以
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Probably Steve Rogers.

234
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,600
噢 真好
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, great.

235
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,350
我是说可能
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Maybe.

236
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,020
但是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But...

237
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,520
给他打电话啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Call him.

238
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,610
没有你想得那么容易
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's not that easy.

239
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,570
天啊 我们是不是太久没见了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?

240
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,650
不是啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No.

241
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,360
复仇者联盟解散了 我们玩完了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The Avengers broke up. We're toast.

242
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,160
解散
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Broke up?

243
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,120
你是说像乐队一样 就像披头士
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Like a band? Like... Like the Beatles?

244
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,040
队长和我吵得很凶
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Cap and I fell out hard.

245
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,210
我们已经不说话了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We're not on speaking terms.

246
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,170
托尼 听我说
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tony, listen to me.

247
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,500
索尔已经死了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thor's gone.

248
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,300
灭霸正在来的路上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos is coming.

249
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,180
你跟谁说不说话已经不重要了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.

250
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
破翻盖手机
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Flip phone.

00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,340
暂不确定 我正在查
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not sure. I'm working on it.

264
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,430
嘿 你最好把那个时间原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Might wanna use it.

267
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,840
内德 嘿 你转移一下大家的注意力
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We're all gonna die!

270
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,590

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}There's a spaceship!

271
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,430

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What's the matter with you kids?

273
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,770
没见过宇宙飞船是咋滴
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You never seen a spaceship before?

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}at the hands of the Children of Thanos.

280
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,830
要心存感激
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Be thankful...

281
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,750
你们这些渺小的生命是在做贡献
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}that your meaningless lives are now contributing...

282
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,710
不好意思 地球今天不营业
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.

283
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,590
你赶紧打包滚吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You better pack it up and get outta here.

284
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,670
原石守护者
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stonekeeper.

285
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,220
这个多嘴怪是在替你说话吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Does this chattering animal speak for you?

286
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,390
当然不是了 我自己有嘴
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Certainly not. I speak for myself.

287
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,760
你非法入侵了这个星球的这个城市
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're trespassing in this city and on this planet.

288
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,430
他的意思是让你赶紧滚 章鱼哥
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He means get lost, Squidward.

289
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,640
他真让我心累
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He exhausts me.

290
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,730
把原石给我拿过来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Bring me the stone.

291
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,770

来吧 加把劲
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come on, come on, man.

天啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}God!

302
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,250
你的大伙伴呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where's your guy?

303
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,960
我不知道 我们之间好像有点小矛盾
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I don't know. We've sorta been having a thing.

304
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,340
-可没时间闹小矛盾了 -我知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- It's no time for a thing. - I know.

305

集中精力看着那边的那个东西
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's the thing right there. Let's go.

306
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,100
老哥 你让我在巫师面前丢脸了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.

307
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,350
托尼 抱歉 不是我不行就是他不想
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tony, I'm sorry. Either I can't or he won't.

308
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,310
没事
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's okay.

309
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,850
你退后吧 麻烦你照顾一下他 谢谢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey, stand down. Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

310
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,310
-我罩他 -该死
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- I have him. - Damn it.

311
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,340
这玩意从哪儿冒出来的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where'd that come from?

312
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,430
这是纳米技术
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's nanotech.

313
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,470

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gotta get that stone outta here, now.

317
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,320
石在我在

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Really good. Do you plan on helping out?

322
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,920
我尽力了 他就是不出来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm trying. He won't come out.

323
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,880
小心铁锤
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hammer.

327
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,860
"不"是什么意思
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What do you mean, "No"?

328
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,540
嘿 史塔克先生 这是什么情况
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?

329
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,370
-小子 你从哪儿冒出来的 -我正在去现代美术馆参观的路上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Kid, where'd you come from? - A field trip to MoMA.

330
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,750
这家伙是什么情况 史塔克先生
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, what is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?

331
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,750
他是从宇宙来的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, he's from space.

332
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,010
他是来偷走巫师的项链的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.

333
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,580
你的把戏真有趣
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Your powers are quaint.

334
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,410
你肯定很受小孩子欢迎
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You must be popular with children.

335
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,120
这是个很简单的咒语 但很难解除
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.

336
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,590
那我就用你的死来破咒
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Then I'll take it off your corpse.

337
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:37,560
要破解死人的咒语可不容易
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You'll find removing a dead man's spell troublesome.

338
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,190
那就让你生不如死
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You'll only wish you were dead.

339
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,490
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No!

340
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,160
小家伙 那就是巫师 去救他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.

341
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,790
这就去
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}On it!

342
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,630
你真阴
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not cool.

343
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,850
接到你了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gotcha!

344
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,010
等一下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wait!

345
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,860
史塔克先生 我要被吸上去了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, Mr. Stark, I'm being beamed up.

346
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,110
坚持住 小子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hang on, kid.

347
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,840
王 你一定要来参加我的婚礼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wong, you're invited to my wedding.

348
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,600
给我加点料 星期五
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Give me a little juice, Friday.

349
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,940
发射17A
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Unlock 17A.

350
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,710
彼得 你快放手 我会接住你的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.

351
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,080
但你说要我救那个巫师
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But you said save the wizard!

352
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,210
我不能呼吸了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I can't breathe.

353
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,050
我们飞得太高了 你会缺氧的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We're too high up. You're running out of air.

354
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,220
是哦 有道理
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah. That makes sense.

355
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,740
史塔克先生 这闻着像一辆新车
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!

356
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,740
旅途愉快 小子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Happy trails, kid.

357
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,160
-星期五 送他回家 -好的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Friday, send him home. - Yep.

358
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,700
别啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, come on!

359
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,170
老板 波兹小姐来电
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.

360
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,210
托尼 我的天
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tony? Oh, my God.

361
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,250
你还好吗 出了什么事情
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Are you all right? What's going on?

362
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,340
我没事 我只是在想
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, I'm fine. I just think

363
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,170
我们八点半的约会可能要推迟了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}we might have to push our 8:30 res.

364
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,300
为什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Why?

365
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,970
我就是可能
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Just 'cause I'll probably

366
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,600
短时间内赶不回去了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}not make it back for a while.

367
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,850
告诉我你没在那艘船上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tell me you're not on that ship.

368
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,100
我在
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah.

369

天呐 不 拜托你告诉我你没在那艘船上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}God, no, please tell me you're not on the ship.

370
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,100
亲爱的 我很抱歉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Honey, I'm sorry.

371
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,140
对不起 我不知道该说什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.

372
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,850
回来 托尼 我发誓
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come back here, Tony. I swear to God.

373
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,020
-佩珀 -你马上回来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Pep. - Come back here right now.

374
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,070
回来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come back.

375
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,820
老板 我们失去信号了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Boss, we're losing her.

376
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,280
我也快没信号了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm going too.

377
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,750
老天
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, my God!

378
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,090
我应该留在校车上的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I shoulda stayed on the bus.

379
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,100
你要去哪里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where you going?

380
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,730
时间原石被夺走了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The Time Stone's been taken.

381
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,650
圣所现在无人看守
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The Sanctum remains unguarded.

382
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,730
你接下来要怎么做
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What will you do?

383
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,110
我要打个电话
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm gonna make a call.

384
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,110
斯蒂文·罗杰斯

385
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,070
{\fn方正宋黑简体\c&HCCCBCD&\fs90\b0\fscx100\fscy96\fad(0,800)}太 空

386
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,690
大声唱 德拉克斯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Sing it, Drax!

387
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,790
我们怎么又在干这事
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Why are we doing this again?

388
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,380
那是个求救信号 火箭
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's a distress signal, Rocket.

389
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,710
有人可能要死了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Someone could be dying.

390
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,880
我知道 但我们为什么要去救人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I get that, but why are we doing it?

391
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,880
因为我们人美心善
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}'Cause we're nice.

392
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,920
而且不管那人是谁
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And maybe whoever it is

393
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,800
有可能会给我们点小报酬
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}will give us a little cheddar cheese for our effort.

394
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,220
-那不是重点 -那不是重点
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Which isn't the point. - Which isn't the point.

395
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,100
我是说 如果他没钱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I mean, if he doesn't pony up...

396
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,270
我们就占了他的船
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We take his ship.

397
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,060
-没错 -正确
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Exactly! - Bingo!

398
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,060
就这么决定了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All right!

399
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,230
我们要到了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We are arriving.

400
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,270
好了 守护者们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All right, Guardians,

401
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,730
不要忘记前方或许有危险
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}don't forget this might be dangerous...

402
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,940
所以我们要先摆出一副恶人脸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}so let's put on our mean faces.

403
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,870
格鲁特 马上把那玩意儿放下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Groot, put that thing away, now.

404
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,910
我不想再说第二遍
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I don't wanna tell you again.

405
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,160
格鲁特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Groot.

406
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,330
我是格鲁特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am Groot!

407
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,410
-哇哦 -注意用词
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Whoa! - Language!

408
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,040
-嘿 -哇
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Hey! - Wow.

409
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,920
你翅膀硬了啊 小子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You got some acorns on you, kid.

410
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,420
自从你长大了一点
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Ever since you got a little sap,

411
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,380
就是个十足的小混蛋
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you're a total d-hole.

412
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,760
你要是继续玩 我就把那玩意砸个粉碎
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna smash that thing to pieces.

413
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,140
出了什么事情
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What happened?

414
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,440
天呐
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, my God.

415
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,950
看来我们是得不到报酬了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Looks like we're not getting paid.

416
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,240
开雨刷 开雨刷
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wipers! Wipers!

417
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,450
把那东西刷下去
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Get it off.

418
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:35,130
这小子究竟是怎么活下来的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How the hell is this dude still alive?

419
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,130
他不是个小子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He is not a dude.

420
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,010
你才是小子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're a dude.

421
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,340
他 他是个男人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This... This is a man.

422
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,300
一个英俊潇洒 肌肉发达的男人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A handsome, muscular man.

423
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,350
我肌肉发达啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm muscular.

424
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,430
得了吧 奎尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But who are you kidding, Quill?

425
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,970
你就是块五花肉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're one sandwich away from fat.

426
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:49,980
呵呵
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, right.

427
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,520
是真的 奎尔 你最近胖了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's true, Quill. You have put on weight.

428
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,730
什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What?

429
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,820
卡魔拉 你也觉得我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gamora, do you think I'm...

430
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:02,860
他很焦虑 愤怒
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He is anxious, angry.

431
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,490
他痛失了很多 心怀愧疚
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He feels tremendous loss and guilt.

432
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:09,330
他就像是海盗和天使生的孩子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.

433
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,330
哇哦
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wow.

434
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,500
这一句还真是敲醒了我 好吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay.

435
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,420
我要买台跑步机 说到做到
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit.

436
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,500
我还要买哑铃
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

437
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,130
哑铃是不能吃的 好吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?

438
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,340
他的肌肉就像是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's like his muscles

439
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,420
用科塔蒂金属纤维造成的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}are made of Cotati metal fibers.

440
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,180
别再摸他的肌肉了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stop massaging his muscles.

441
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,010
叫醒他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wake him up.

442
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,350
醒醒
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wake.

443
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,990
你们是谁
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Who the hell are you guys?

444
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,460
我认识灭霸这么久 他一直就只有一个目标
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal.

445
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,290
通过消除宇宙一半的生命
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}To bring balance to the universe

446
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,380
来维持宇宙的平衡
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}by wiping out half of all life.

447
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,590
他曾经一个星球接一个星球地杀人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He used to kill people planet by planet,

448
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,340
一次又一次的大屠杀
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}massacre by massacre.

449
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,970
包括我的星球
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Including my own.

450
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,550
他要是得到了六颗原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If he gets all six Infinity Stones...

451
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,930
他打个响指就能除掉一半的人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}he can do it with the snap of his fingers like this.

452
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,560
你似乎很了解灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.

453
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,400
卡魔拉是灭霸的女儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gamora is the daughter of Thanos.

454
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,490
你父亲杀死了我弟弟
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Your father killed my brother.

455
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,240
真狗血啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, boy.

456
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,120
严格来讲 是养女
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stepfather, technically.

457
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,080
她跟你一样恨灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And she hates him as much as you do.

458
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,410
家家有本难念的经
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Families can be tough.

459
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,920
我父亲死之前
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Before my father died,

460
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,670
他告诉我 我有个同父异母的姐姐
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}he told me that I had a half-sister...

461
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,210
他把她关在地狱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}that he imprisoned in Hel.

462
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,300
然后她回家了 戳瞎了我的眼睛
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And then she returned home and stabbed me in the eye.

463
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,670
所以我不得不杀了她
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So I had to kill her.

464
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,970
我想生活就是这样 不是吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's life though, isn't it, I guess.

465
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,180
冤冤相报何时了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Goes round and round and...

466
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,180
我懂你的难处
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I feel your pain.

467
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,560
我也懂你的难处 因为
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I feel your pain as well, because...

468
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,930
我是说 虽然我不想跟你们比较
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I mean, it's not a competition,

469
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,190
但我也过得很惨
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}but I've been through a lot.

470
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,060
我爸爸杀了我妈妈
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}My father killed my mother.

471
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,230
然后我又杀了我爸爸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And then I had to kill my father.

472
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,940
真的很难
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That was hard.

473
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,280
可能比杀死姐姐要难一点
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Probably even harder than having to kill a sister.

474
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,320
至少我的眼睛都还在 所以
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Plus, I came out with both my eyes, which was...

475
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,120
我要的是锤子 不是汤勺
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I need a hammer, not a spoon.

476
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:14,450
我要怎么启动这东西 有没有密码之类的 呃
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of, uh...

477
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,160
四位数的密码 有可能是生日
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A four-digit code, maybe? Maybe a birthdate.

478
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,540
-你在做什么 -开走你们的分离舱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Uh, what are you doing? - Taking your pod.

479
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,880
不 不可以
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, you're not.

480
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:29,470
我不允许你驾驶我们的分离舱 先生
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You will not be taking our pod today, sir.

481
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,970
额 奎尔 你是故意把你的声音压低吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh... Quill, are you making your voice deeper?

482
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,560
-没有 -你有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- No. - You are.

483
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,480
你在模仿那位男神 很怪
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.

484
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,940
没有 我没有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, I'm not.

485
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,980
-他又模仿了一次 -我的声音本来就这样
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- He just did it again! - This is my voice.

486
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,490
你是在嘲笑我吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Are you mocking me?

487
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,990
-你是在嘲笑我吗 -够了 你又在学我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Are you mocking me? - Stop it. You did it again.

488
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,080
他在模仿我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He's trying to copy me.

489
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,200
你最好别再学我说话
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I need you to stop doing that.

490
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,040
-够了 -是他先开始的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Enough! - He's doing it first.

491
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,500
我们要阻止灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We need to stop Thanos.

492
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,170
也就是说 我们需要搞清楚
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Which means we need to find out

493
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,330
他下一步是去哪里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}where he's going next.

494
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,670
虚无知地[哪儿也不去]
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Knowhere.

495
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,500
他肯定是要去什么地方的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He must be going somewhere.

496
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,670
不是吧 虚无知地
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, no. Knowhere?

497
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,510
那是个地名 我们去过 那地方太烂了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's a place. We've been there. It sucks.

498
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,390
-不好意思 那是我们的食物 -现在是我的了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Excuse me, that's our food. - Not anymore.

499
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:16,680
索尔 他为什么要去虚无知地
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thor, why would he go to Knowhere?

500
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,140
因为现实原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Because for years...

501
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,310
安全无恙地被寄放在那里好几年了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the Reality Stone's been safely stored there

502
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,980
在一个叫收藏者的人手里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}with a man called the Collector.

503
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,610
如果是在收藏者手里 那就不安全了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe.

504
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,520
蠢货才会把原石交给他呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Only an idiot would give that man a stone.

505
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,150
-天才也会 -你怎么知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Or a genius. - How do you know...

506
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,700
他不会去找其他原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}he's not going for one of the other stones?

507
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,320
无限原石一共有六颗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}There are six stones out there.

508
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,660
灭霸上星期毁灭山达尔星时
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos already has the Power Stone...

509
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,450
从那里得到了力量原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}because he stole it last week when he decimated Xandar.

510
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,620
他毁了我的船
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He stole the Space Stone from me...

511
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,500
屠杀了我一半的子民 又从我手上夺走了空间原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people.

512
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,250
时间原石和心灵原石在地球上很安全
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.

513
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,500
由复仇者联盟守护着
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They're with the Avengers.

514
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,050
-复仇者联盟 -地球上最强大的英雄们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- The Avengers? - Earth's mightiest heroes.

515
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,300
像凯文·贝肯那样的吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Like Kevin Bacon?

516
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,590
他可能也是队里一员吧 我不知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He may be on the team. I don't know.

517
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,680
我很久没去地球了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I haven't been there in a while.

518
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,220
至于灵魂原石 没人见过这颗原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that.

519
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,060
也没人知道它在哪里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No one even knows where it is.

520
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,720
因此灭霸得不到这颗原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Therefore Thanos can't get it.

521
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,430
所以他会先去虚无知地
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Therefore he's going to Knowhere.

522
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:03,100
因为他要去找现实原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hence he'll be getting the Reality Stone.

523
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,270
不用谢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're welcome.

524
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,560
那我们现在就得去虚无知地
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Then we have to go to Knowhere now.

525
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,690
不对 我们要去的地方是尼德威阿尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wrong. Where we have to go is Nidavellir.

526
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,700
-这词是你编的吧 -所有词都是编的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- That's a made-up word. - All words are made up.

527
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,070
真有尼德威阿尔这个地方 没开玩笑吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

528
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,740
那地方是一个传奇
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That place is a legend.

529
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,330
他们制造出最强大 最可怕的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They make the most powerful, horrific weapons

530
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,500
让整个宇宙都饱受折磨的武器
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to ever torment the universe.

531
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,670
我倒是很想去一下这地方
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I would very much like to go there, please.

532
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,750
这只兔子说得对
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The rabbit is correct

533
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,830
很明显他是你们之中最聪明的了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and clearly the smartest among you.

534
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,880
兔子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Rabbit?

535
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,550
只有矮人伊特里能打造出我需要的武器
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Only Eitri the Dwarf can make me the weapon I need.

536
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,840
我想你就是队长吧 先生
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I assume you're the captain, sir.

537
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,170
好眼力
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're very perceptive.

538
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,380
你看着像是个道德高尚的好队长
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You seem like a noble leader.

539
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,220
你愿意和我一起去探访尼德威阿尔吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?

540
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,180
请让我请示一下我们的队长 等等 我就是队长
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Let me just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me!

541
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,100
-没问题 我去 -很好
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Yeah. I'll go. - Wonderful!

542
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,270
呃 我才是队长
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, except for that I'm the captain.

543
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,480
奎尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Quiet.

544
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,140
-那是我的背包 -去坐好
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- That's my backpack. - Go sit down.

545
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,770
听着 这是我的飞船
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Look, this is my ship.

546
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:47,570
我不会去
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And I'm not goin' to...

547
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,780
等等 我们在说什么武器来着
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wait, what kinda weapon are we talkin' about here?

548
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,860
能杀死灭霸的那种
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The Thanos-killing kind.

549
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,570
你不觉得那样的武器我们应该人手一把吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?

550
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,780
不觉得 你力气不够 驾驭不了那样的武器
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No. You simply lack the strength to wield them.

551
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,070
当你的精神不稳定时
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Your bodies would crumble

552
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,370
你的身体会不堪一击
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}as your minds collapsed into madness.

553
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,410
你这么一说我更想试试了 是不是很奇怪
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?

554
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,700
是有点奇怪
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

555
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,160
如果我们不去虚无知地
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If we don't go to Knowhere

556
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,790
让灭霸再得到一颗原石的话
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and Thanos retrieves another stone...

557
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,540
那他会强大得无法阻止
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}he'll be too powerful to stop.

558
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,790
-他已经是了 -我想到办法了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- He already is. - I got it figured out.

559
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,630
我们有两艘船
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We got two ships

560
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,260
和一大群蠢货
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and a large assortment of morons.

561
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,590
那么 我和格鲁特跟着海盗天使走
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So me and Groot will go with the pirate angel here.

562
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,800
剩下的蠢货去虚无知地
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And the morons will go to Knowhere

563
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,600
试着阻止灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to try to stop Thanos.

564
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,680
-同意吗 同意 -非常同意
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Cool? Cool. - So cool.

565
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,730
郑重声明
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}For the record...

566
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,270
我知道你之所以跟他走
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I know that you're going with him

567
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,440
是因为那里没有灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}because it's where Thanos isn't.

568
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,100
你知道的 你真的不该
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know, you really shouldn't

569
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,230
这样跟你的队长说话 奎尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}talk that way to your captain, Quill.

570
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,900
走吧 格鲁特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come on, Groot.

571
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,740
别玩游戏了 脑子都玩坏了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Put that game down. You'll rot your brain.

572
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:41,450
就此告别 祝你们好运 蠢货们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I bid you farewell and good luck, morons.

573
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,540
拜
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Bye.

574
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,840
幻视
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Vis?

575
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,890
原石又有反映了吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Is it the stone again?

576
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,600
它好像在跟我说些什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's as if it's speaking to me.

577
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,810
它说了什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What does it say?

578
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,270
我不 我不知道 但确实想要告诉我什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I don't... I don't know, but something.

579
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,650
嘿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey.

580
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,120
告诉我 你感受到了什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tell me what you feel.

581
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,710
我只感受到了你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I just feel you.

582

583
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,890
十点钟有班车去格拉斯哥
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So there's a 10:00 a.M. To Glasgow...

584
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:46,230
这样在你回去之前 我们能多待一会儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}which would give us more time together before you went back.

585
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,730
万一我错过那班车怎么办
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What if I miss that train?

586
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:48,850
十一点还有一班
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}There's an 11:00.

587
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,400
如果我错过了所有的班车呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What if I missed all the trains?

588
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,610
如果我这次去了就回不来呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What if this time I didn't go back?

589
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,190
但你已经答应史塔克了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But you gave Stark your word.

590
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,360
我宁愿承诺于你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'd rather give it to you.

591
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,570
你知道的 也有人在等着我回去的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Well, there are people who are expecting me too, you know.

592
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,990
我们都做出了承诺
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We both made promises.

593
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,740
但不是对彼此
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not to each other.

旺达

00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,830
试着证明我们俩之间有可能
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}trying to see if this could work and...

597
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,630
我不知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I don't know.

598
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,670
你知道的 我只是想为我自己说几句
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself.

599
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,630
我想
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I think...

600
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,840
-有可能的 -有可能的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- It works. - It works.

601
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,260

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It works.

602
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,840
留下吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stay.

603
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,510
别离开我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stay with me.

如果其中一方过重
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Too much to one side or the other...

663

给你 你来试试

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gamora.

669
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,820
你说这些手榴弹是那种炸烂小丁丁型的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Do you know if these grenades

670
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,150
还是瓦斯型的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}are the blow-off-your-junk kind or the gas kind?

671
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,320
因为我在考虑
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Because I was thinking about

672
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,030
挂几个在我的腰带上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}hanging a couple on my belt right here.

673
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,160
但如果这是那种类型就不好了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But I don't want to if they're the...

674
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,370
我想求你帮个忙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I need to ask a favor.

675
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:43,790
当然 说吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, sure.

676
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,330
不管发生什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}One way or another,

677
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:48,750
我们最终肯定会跟灭霸交手
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the path that we're on leads to Thanos.

678
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:52,880
是啊 所以我才准备这些手榴弹
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Which is what the grenades are for.

679
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,170
抱歉跑题了 你要我帮什么忙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, I'm sorry. What's the favor?

680
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:58,630
如果进展不顺
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If things go wrong...

681
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,220
如果灭霸抓到了我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If Thanos gets me...

682
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:08,850
我要你对我保证
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I want you to promise me...

683
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:10,980
你会杀了我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you'll kill me.

684
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:12,770
什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What?

685
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,200
我知道一些他不知道的秘密
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I know something he doesn't.

686
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:23,080
如果被他发现
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And if he finds it out,

687
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,370
整个宇宙都会处于危险之中
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the entire universe could be at risk.

688
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,330
什么秘密
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What do you know?

689
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:28,370
如果我告诉你 你也会知道的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If I tell you, you'd know too.

690
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,340
但如果这件事这么重要
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If it's so important...

691
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,500
我不应该知道吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}shouldn't I?

692
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,670
除非你想自寻死路
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Only if you wanna die.

693
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,670
为什么非得假设有个人会牺牲呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?

694
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,010
你只要
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Just...

695
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,470
相信我 很有可能需要杀了我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Trust me. And possibly kill me.

696
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:48,060
呃 我很乐意
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I mean, I'd like to.

697
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,060
我真的愿意 但你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I really would. But you...

698
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,230
向我发誓
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Swear to me.

699
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,070
以你母亲的名义发誓
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Swear to me on your mother.

700
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,080
好吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay.

701
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,250
我发誓
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay.

702
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:29,560
-噢 -大哥
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Oh. - Dude.

703
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,270
你站在那儿多久了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How long have you been standing there?

704
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:32,270
一个小时
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}An hour.

705
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,110
一个小时
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}An hour?

706
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,110
你是在开玩笑吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Are you serious?

707
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:38,280
我最近掌握了一个技能
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I've mastered the ability

708
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,030
我只要站在这里一动不动
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}of standing so incredibly still...

709
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,870
肉眼就看不到我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}that I become invisible to the eye.

710
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,370
看吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Watch.

711
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:52,330
你不是在吃坚果吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're eating a zarg-nut.

712
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:53,870
但我的动作
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But my movement...

713
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,250
非常之慢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}was so slow...

714
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,130
你们根本感觉不到
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}that it's imperceptible.

715
00:46:59,130 --> 00:46:59,960
呃 并没有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Mmm, no.

716
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,590
我很确定我隐形了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sure I'm invisible.

717
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:03,930
嗨 德拉克斯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hi, Drax.

718
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:07,470
该死
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Damn it.

719
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:24,970
{\fn方正宋黑简体\c&HCCCBCD&\fs90\b1\fscx100\fscy96\fad(1200,1200)\pos(640,326.133)}虚无知地

720
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:29,330
这个地方看起来好荒凉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This place looks deserted.

721
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:32,290
我正在获取第三象限的动态
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm reading movement in the third quadrant.

722
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,210
我也收到了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yep, I'm picking that up too.

723
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,130
我们就在这降落吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Let's put down right here.

724
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:50,350
原石不在我这儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I don't have it.

725
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,310
银河系的所有人都知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Everyone in the galaxy knows

726
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:55,980
你为了自己
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you'd sell your own brother...

727
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,610
哪怕是那一点点的蝇头小利
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}if you thought it would add even the slightest trinket...

728
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:59,520
都不惜出卖自己的亲兄弟
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to your pathetic collection.

729
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,870
我知道你有现实原石 蒂万
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan.

730
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,250
交给我你就不用受折磨
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.

731
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,130
我跟你说过
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I told you.

732
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,960
我已经卖掉了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I sold it.

733
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:26,010
我有什么理由对你说谎呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Why would I lie?

734
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:28,180
我认为说谎对你来说像呼吸一样稀松平常
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I imagine it's like breathing for you.

735
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:30,930
说谎就是找死
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Like suicide.

736
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:33,310
看来你明白我的意思
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You do understand.

737
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:36,440
就算是你 也不愿意白白交出如此珍贵的东西
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not even you would surrender something so precious.

738
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,230
我不知道它的来历
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I didn't know what it was.

739
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:41,230
那你比我想象中的还要愚蠢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Then you're more of a fool than I took you for.

740
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:42,360
就是他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's him.

741
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,980
我再给你最后一次机会 谎话精
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Last chance, charlatan.

742
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,450
原石在哪里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where's the stone?

743
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:48,990
今天
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Today...

744
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,070
德拉克斯 德拉克斯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Drax. Drax.

745
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:52,160
就是你为我的妻女血债血偿的日子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}...he pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.

746
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,200
德拉克斯 等等
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Drax, wait.

747
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,250
还不行 还不是时候
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not yet, not yet, not yet.

748
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,410
德拉克斯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Drax.

749
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,670
德拉克斯 德拉克斯 听我说
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Drax, Drax, Drax. Listen to me.

750
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:06,220
他还没有拿到原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He doesn't have the stone yet.

751
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,590
如果我们能拿到 我们就可以阻止他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If we get it, then we can stop him.

752
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:12,050
首要任务是拿到原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We have to get the stone first. Yeah.

753
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,260
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No.

754
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,640
不 为了奥维特 为了卡马利亚
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

755
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,100
沉睡吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Sleep.

756
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:31,160
好了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay.

757
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:35,240
卡魔拉 曼蒂斯 你们走右边
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

758
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,960
是你们的右边
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The other right.

759
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:03,980
为什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Why?

760
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:18,000
为什么是你 女儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Why you, daughter?

761
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:37,520
真够快的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That was quick.

762
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:48,280
妙极了 真是妙极了 妙极了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!

763
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:53,320
你是在为我难过吗 女儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Is that sadness I sense in you, daughter?

764
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:59,040
我知道 你还是在乎我的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}In my heart, I knew you still cared.

765
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,550
果然还是眼见为实啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But one never knows for sure.

766
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,560
现实总是令人失望
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Reality is often disappointing.

767
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:27,110
它曾是如此
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That is, it was.

768
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:30,440
但如今
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Now...

769
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:35,280
现实由我掌控了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}reality can be whatever I want.

770
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,410
你知道我会来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You knew I'd come.

771
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:40,740
我等着你来呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I counted on it.

772
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:43,710
我们还有些事情要谈 小家伙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}There's something we need to discuss, little one.

773
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,170
灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos!

774
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,680
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No!

775
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:05,210
奶昔大哥：麦当劳人物，紫色玩偶；类比国内“紫薯精”叫法。

776
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,230
放了她 奶昔大哥
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Let her go, Grimace.

777
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:06,230
彼特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Peter.

778
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:08,770
我让你走右边的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I told you to go right.

779
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,900
现在还要跟我争这个
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Now? Really?

780
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,780
放了她
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You let her go!

781
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,650
原来是小男朋友啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Ah, the boyfriend.

782
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:15,780
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No.

783
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,200
我更像是一个
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Like to think of myself

784
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,700
随叫随到 专杀泰坦星人的职业杀手
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}more as a Titan-killing, long-term booty call.

785
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,870
-放了她 -彼特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Let her go. - Peter.

786
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:26,620
不然我就打爆你那螺丝帽一样的下巴
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin right off your face.

787
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:28,710
你要杀的不是他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not him.

788
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,850
你答应过我的 你答应过的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You promised. You promised.

789
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:48,730
噢 女儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, daughter.

790
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:51,320
你对他的期望太高了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You expect too much from him.

791
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,490
是她要求你这样做的 是吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}She's asked, hasn't she?

792
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:01,450
开枪吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Do it.

793
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:06,500
哼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Mmm.

794
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,250
开枪
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Do it!

795
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,380
我让你走右边的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I told you to go right.

796
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:22,350
我爱你胜过一切
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I love you more than anything.

797
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:26,850
我也爱你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I love you too.

798
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,320
我喜欢这小子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I like him.

799
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,940
还没有幻视的消息吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Still no word from Vision?

800
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:18,360
卫星在爱丁堡的某个地方失去了他的信号
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.

801
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,570
他在一辆被盗的昆式战斗机上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}On a stolen Quinjet

802
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:21,660
和四个世界上最高通缉的罪犯一起
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}with four of the world's most wanted criminals.

803
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,370
他们之所以是罪犯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know they're only criminals because

804
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:24,910
都是因为你们 不是吗 长官
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?

805
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:26,040
我的天 罗德斯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}My God, Rhodes.

806
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,660
你比我还能说谎
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Your talent for horseshit rivals my own.

807
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,830
如果不是因为那些协定
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If it weren't for those Accords,

808
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:32,920
幻视现在就在这里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Vision would've been right here.

809
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,300
我可记得那协定上有你的亲笔签名呢 上校
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.

810
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:37,510
这倒没错
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's right.

811
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,720
我也很肯定我为此付出了代价
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And I'm pretty sure I paid for that.

812
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,010
你犹豫了吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You have second thoughts?

813
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:44,760
不再犹豫了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not anymore.

814
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,310
国务卿先生
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Mr. Secretary.

815
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:58,480
你们胆子可真大
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You got some nerve.

816
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:00,860
这是我对你们的评价
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'll give you that.

817
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,660
现在需要胆量的是你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You could use some of that right now.

818
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:06,580
世界现在水深火热
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The world's on fire.

819
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:10,290
你们以为之前的账就此一笔勾销了吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And you think all is forgiven?

820
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:12,080
我不是来寻求原谅的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm not looking for forgiveness.

821
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,380
我也早就不再征求允许了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And I'm way past asking permission.

822
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,750
地球刚刚失去了她最好的守护者
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Earth just lost her best defender.

823
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,920
所以我们是来战斗的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So we're here to fight.

824
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:23,550
如果你想挡我们的道
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And if you wanna stand in our way...

825
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:26,470
我们会把你也拿下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}we'll fight you too.

826
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,680
逮捕他们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Arrest them.

827
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,680
没问题
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All over it.

828
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,820
估计我得上军事法庭了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's a court-martial.

829
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,400
很高兴见到你 队长
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's great to see you, Cap.

830
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:46,370
我也是 罗迪
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You too, Rhodey.

831
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:47,370
嘿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey.

832
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,870
哇 你们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wow. You guys...

833
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,870
看上去真是一团糟
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}really look like crap.

834
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:55,670
这几年过得不怎么样吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Must've been a rough couple years.

835
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:58,790
是啊 又不是天天住五星级酒店
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.

836
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,920
我觉得你们看上去棒极了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, I think you look great.

837
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,470
呃
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh...

838
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:10,010
没错 我回来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, I'm back.

839
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:12,770
嗨 布鲁斯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hi, Bruce.

840
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,400
小娜
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Nat.

841
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,360
尴尬了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This is awkward.

842
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,530
他们一定会回来的是吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?

843
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:29,830
而且他们肯定能找到我们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And they can clearly find us.

844
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:32,410
我们得全员待命 克林特去哪了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?

845
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:33,870
签署协议的那件事以后
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}After the whole Accords situation,

846
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:35,620
他和斯科特都达成了协议 他们要为家庭考虑
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough

847
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,170
现在都被软禁在家里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}on their families. They're on house arrest.

848
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:38,710
-斯科特是谁 -蚁人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Who's Scott? - Ant-Man.

849
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:40,090
我们有了蜘蛛侠又来个蚁人吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?

850
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,050
好了 听着
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay, look.

851
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:45,130
灭霸拥有宇宙中最强大的军队
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos has the biggest army in the universe...

852
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:48,680
他不拿到幻视的原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and he is not gonna stop until he gets...

853
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:51,680
绝不会罢休
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Vision's stone.

854
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,020
那我们必须保护好它
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Then we have to protect it.

855
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,730
不 我们必须毁了它
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, we have to destroy it.

856
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,190
我头顶的这颗原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I've been giving a good deal of thought

857
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,520
我想了很久
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to this entity in my head.

858
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,520
关于它的性质
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}About its nature.

859
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,820
还有它的组成
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But also its composition.

860
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,860
我觉得如果它被暴露在
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I think if it were exposed

861
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,860
一个和它性质相同的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to a sufficiently powerful energy source...

862
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:11,740
无比巨大的能量源之下 也许
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}something very similar to its own signature, perhaps...

863
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:16,000
它的分子完整性将会被破坏
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}its molecular integrity could fail.

864
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,750
是啊 你也一样
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, and you with it.

865
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,460
我是不会同意的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We're not having this conversation.

866
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,550
毁掉这颗原石 是唯一能确保
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Eliminating the stone is the only way

867
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:24,960
灭霸得不到它的方式
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to be certain that Thanos can't get it.

868
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,130
这代价太高了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's too high a price.

869
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,060
只有你有能力付出这个代价
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Only you have the power to pay it.

870
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,600
灭霸正威胁着半个宇宙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos threatens half the universe.

871
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,190
不能让一条生命阻碍我们的行动
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.

872
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:44,730
但确实会
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But it should.

873
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:48,740
我们不拿性命做交换 幻视
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We don't trade lives, Vision.

874
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,870
队长 七十年前 你放弃自己的生命
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life...

875
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:52,830
救了数百万人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to save how many millions of people?

876
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:54,990
告诉我 这两者有什么区别
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tell me, why is this any different?

877
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:57,410
因为你可能还有选择
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Because you might have a choice.

878
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,000
你的大脑
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Your mind is made up

879
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,630
是由一些复杂的覆盖网络构成的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}of a complex construct of overlays.

880
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:06,260
贾维斯 奥创 托尼 我 还有原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Jarvis, Ultron, Tony, me, the stone.

881
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,090
所有这些结合在一起
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All of them mixed together,

882
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:10,010
在你体内取长补短
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}all of them learning from one another.

883
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:11,930
你是说幻视并不只是原石而已吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?

884
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:15,140
我是说如果我们取出原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm saying that if we take out the stone...

885
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,770
还会有很大一部分的幻视存在
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}there's still a whole lot of Vision left.

886
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:18,600
或许还是最精华的部分
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Perhaps the best parts.

887
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,850
我们可以做到吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Can we do that?

888
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,650
我不行 这儿也没有条件
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not me, not here.

889
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:24,150
那你最好快点找到
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Well, you better find someone

890
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:25,610
能做这件事的人和地点
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and somewhere fast.

891
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:26,980
罗斯不可能这么轻易地
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Ross isn't just gonna let you guys

892
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:28,150
放过你们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}have your old rooms back.

893
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,870
我知道一个地方
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I know somewhere.

894
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:49,530
{\fn方正宋黑简体\blur0.4\c&HDDE3E2&\fs90\b1\fscx100\fscy96\fad(0,800)\pos(640,326.133)}瓦坎达

895
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:48,840
国王护卫队
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The Kingsguard

896
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,220
和女子皇家亲卫队都在待命中
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.

897
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,220
边境部落呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And the Border Tribe?

898
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:54,140
他们留守边境
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Those that are left.

899
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,560
也给贾巴里部落传个话
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Send word to the Jabari as well.

900
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,680
姆巴库喜欢打仗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}M'Baku likes a good fight.

901
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:03,150
那他呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And what of this one?

902
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:05,690
这个人可能已经厌倦了战争
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This one may be tired of war.

903
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:08,730
但是白狼已经休整够了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But the White Wolf has rested long enough.

904
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:32,930
什么时候开战
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where's the fight?

905
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,180
马上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}On its way.

906
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:56,200
我为灭霸做事这么久
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}In all the time I've served Thanos...

907
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,080
从没让他失望过
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I have never failed him.

908
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:08,380
如果原石还镶在
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan...

909
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,090
你这个讨厌的人身上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}with the Time Stone still attached

910
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:12,380
而我却两手空空地回到泰坦星见他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to your vaguely irritating person...

911
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:15,050
那可就说不过去了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}there would be judgment.

912
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:25,140
把原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Give me...

913
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,020
给我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the stone.

914
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:43,950
哇 你还真是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wow, you're a seriously

915
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,160
一件忠心耿耿的披风啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?

916
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,830
呃 说到忠心耿耿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...

917
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:49,210
你怎么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What the...

918
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:50,920
-我知道您要说什么 -你不该来这里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- I know what you're gonna say. - You should not be here.

919
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,920
-我本来要回家的 -我不想听
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- I was gonna go home. - I don't wanna hear it.

920
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,380
但我家那么远 我在半路上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But it was such a long way down and I just thought

921
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:54,260
-想到了您 -现在也不得不听着了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- about you on the way... - And now I gotta hear it.

922
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,340
而且我还被卡在了飞船的一边
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}...and kinda stuck to the side of the ship.

923
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,930
顺便一说 这套战衣好像也感觉到了危险
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way.

924
01:00:57,930 --> 01:00:59,050
该死
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}God damn it.

925
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:02,010
所以 如果非要说的话 其实我在这里也怪你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So, if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.

926
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:03,430
-你说什么 -我收回
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- What did you just say? - I take that back.

927
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:04,980
现在我已经在太空里了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And now, I'm here in space.

928
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:07,650
是啊 就在我最不想让你来的地方
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, right where I didn't want you to be.

929
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:09,860
这不是康尼岛 不是出外勤
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip.

930
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:10,980
这儿可是有去无回
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This is a one-way ticket.

931
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,820
你明白了吗 别假装你已经想清楚了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You hear me? Don't pretend you thought this through.

932
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:13,940
我确实想清楚了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, I did think this through.

933
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,740
你怎么可能想清楚
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You could not have possibly thought this through.

934
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,280
如果整个社区都没了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man...

935
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,950
我如何当个友好的社区蜘蛛侠
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}if there's no neighborhood.

936
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,240
好吧 好像这么说也不对
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay, that didn't really make sense,

937
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,700
但你知道我想表达什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}but you know what I'm trying to say.

938
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:29,710
好吧 我们现在有个状况
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come on. We got a situation.

939
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:30,790
看见下面那个人了吗 他有麻烦了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}See him down there? He's in trouble.

940
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:31,840
你有什么计划吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What's your plan?

941
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:32,960
-说 -呃
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Go. - Um...

942
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:35,300
好吧 好吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay, okay... Uh...

943
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,720
你看过一部非常老的电影吗 叫《异形》
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?

944
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:45,140
很痛苦吧 是不是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Painful, aren't they?

945
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:48,810
这些针最初是在显微外科手术中使用的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They were originally designed for microsurgery.

946
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:50,900
而其中的任意一根
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And any one of them...

947
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:58,820
都能瞬间结束你朋友的生命
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}could end your friend's life in an instant.

948
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:00,450
实话实说 他其实不是我的朋友
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend.

949
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:03,160
救他的命其实只是出于职业素养而已
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Saving his life is more of a professional courtesy.

950
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:07,710
你还没救成呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You've saved nothing.

951
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:09,790
你的力量和我相比
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Your powers are inconsequential

952
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:11,290
根本不值一提
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}compared to mine.

953
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:13,000
是啊 但那孩子看的电影更多
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.

954
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:29,270
太棒了 等等 那些是什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yes! Wait. What are those?

955
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:46,740
嗨 咱们还没有正式见过面呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey, we haven't officially met.

956
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,040
好吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Cool.

957
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,540
我们要调转航向
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We gotta turn this ship around.

958
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:54,880
是啊 现在你倒是想逃了 真是一个好计划
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, now he wants to run. Great plan.

959
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,340
不 我想保护原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, I want to protect the stone.

960
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,760
我还想听你感谢我呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And I want you to thank me.

961
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,300
现在说吧 我听着呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

962
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:02,220
谢你什么 差点把我炸进太空吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}For what? Nearly blasting me into space?

963
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:04,550
是谁刚刚救了你这个大魔术师啊 是我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Who just saved your magical ass? Me.

964
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:05,390
我真的不知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I seriously don't know

965
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:06,560
你是怎么把你的大脑袋塞进那个头盔里的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}how you fit your head into that helmet.

966
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,390
承认吧 我叫你闪开的时候你就应该照做
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Admit it, you should've ducked out when I told you to.

967
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:11,140
我想要你老实待着 而你拒绝了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I tried to bench you. You refused.

968
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,230
我不像你生命中的其他人 我不听命于你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.

969
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:14,940
正因为你不听话
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And due to that fact,

970
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:16,360
我们现在在一个会飞的甜甜圈里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}we're now in a flying doughnut...

971
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,230
离地球几百万里远 还没有后援
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}billions of miles from Earth with no backup.

972
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:20,280
-我是后援 -不 你是偷跑上来的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- I'm backup. - No, you're a stowaway.

973
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,360
大人说话 小孩别插嘴
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The adults are talking.

974
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:24,240
对不起 我搞不清楚你们的关系了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here.

975
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,080
他是谁 你的保镖吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What is he, your ward?

976
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,450
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No.

977
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:29,500
-我是彼得 -斯特兰奇博士
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- I'm Peter, by the way. - Doctor Strange.

978
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,250
要用艺名啊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, you're using our made-up names. Um...

979
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,380
那我是蜘蛛侠
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm Spider-Man, then.

980
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:36,040
这架飞船正在自动矫正航线
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This ship is self-correcting its course.

981
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,170
现在是自动驾驶模式
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thing's on autopilot.

982
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:39,090
我们能控制它吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Can we control it?

983
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:41,010
载我们回家
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Fly us home?

984
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,140
-史塔克 -怎么了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Stark? - Yeah.

985
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:46,470
你能带我们回去吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Can you get us home?

986
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:47,890
我听到你的话了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, I heard you.

987
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,480
我只是在想 我不太确定我们应该回去
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm thinking I'm not so sure we should.

988
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:53,890
无论如何
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Under no circumstances

989
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:56,440
我们都不能把时间原石送到灭霸的手中
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos.

990
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,860
我觉得你还没有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I don't think you quite understand

991
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:58,770
搞清楚现在的局势
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}what's at stake here.

992
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:01,400
什么 不 是你不懂
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What? No. It's you who doesn't understand...

993
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,320
自从他派军到纽约时起
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}that Thanos has been inside my head for six years.

994
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,070
灭霸已经在我的脑海中盘踞六年了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Since he sent an army to New York

995
01:04:06,070 --> 01:04:07,830
而现在他回来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and now he's back.

996
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:09,910
而我不知道应该做什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And I don't know what to do.

997
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:11,040
所以我不确定
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So I'm not so sure

998
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,080
这场战役是在我们还是他的地盘上打更好
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his...

999
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,920
但他们的所作所为 他们的能力 你都看见了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}but you saw what they did, what they can do.

1000
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,210
至少在他的地盘上 可以打他个措手不及
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}At least on his turf, he's not expecting it.

1001
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:22,130
所以我说 我们将战火引到他那儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So I say we take the fight to him.

1002
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:23,130
博士
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Doctor.

1003
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:26,470
你同意吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Do you concur?

1004
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:31,470
好吧 史塔克 我们去找他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All right, Stark. We go to him.

1005
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,940
但你必须要明白
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But you have to understand...

1006
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:36,520
如果我需要在救你 还有那个孩子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}if it comes to saving you

1007
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,230
和时间原石中做选择的话
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}or the kid or the Time Stone...

1008
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:42,990
我会毫不犹豫地放弃你们俩的生命
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I will not hesitate to let either of you die.

1009
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:47,160
我不能失去原石 整个宇宙的希望都在它身上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I can't, because the universe depends on it.

1010
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:50,080
很好 提前说清楚道德标准
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Nice. Good, moral compass.

1011
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:52,910
那就这样说定了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We're straight.

1012
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,410
好了 孩子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All right, kid.

1013
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:57,880
你正式是复仇者的一员了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're an Avenger now.

1014
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:36,580
我觉得你可能饿了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I thought you might be hungry.

1015
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,510
我一直恨那把椅子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I always hated that chair.

1016
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:53,260
我听说了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So I've been told.

1017
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:57,230
即便这样 我也希望你有一天能坐上它
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Even so, I'd hoped you'd sit in it one day.

1018
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,440
我恨这个房间
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I hated this room.

1019
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:01,730
这架飞船
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This ship.

1020
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,570
我恨我的人生
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I hated my life.

1021
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:10,280
你也跟我说过了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You told me that too.

1022
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:14,910
每一天
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Every day.

1023
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:19,540
我听了近二十年
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}For almost 20 years.

1024
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:24,500
你带走我时 我还只是个孩子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I was a child when you took me.

1025
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:26,670
我救了你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I saved you.

1026
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:31,090
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No.

1027
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:36,430
不是 我们曾经快乐地生活在我的母星上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No. We were happy on my home planet.

1028
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:38,180
每天在饥饿中入睡
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Going to bed hungry...

1029
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,100
以拾荒为生
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}scrounging for scraps.

1030
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:43,060
你的星球已经在崩溃的边缘了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Your planet was on the brink of collapse.

1031
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:45,480
是我拯救了那一切
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm the one who stopped that.

1032
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,490
你知道后来发生了什么吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Do you know what's happened since then?

1033
01:06:47,490 --> 01:06:49,700
新生儿们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The children born...

1034
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:53,320
在蓝天下过着富足的生活
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies.

1035
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,530
那里成了天堂
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's a paradise.

1036
01:06:57,290 --> 01:06:59,290
因为你杀掉了星球上一半的人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Because you murdered half the planet.

1037
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:02,330
那只是为了救赎而付出的小小代价而已
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A small price to pay for salvation.

1038
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:03,460
你疯了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're insane.

1039
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,590
小家伙 这是一道简单的算术题
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Little one, it's a simple calculus.

1040
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:09,050
宇宙是有限的 它的资源也是有限的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This universe is finite, its resources finite.

1041
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:13,390
如果对生命不加以约束 它最终将走向消亡
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist.

1042
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:14,600
它需要矫正
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It needs correction.

1043
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,100
你不能妄下定论
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You don't know that!

1044
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,390
我是唯一一个看清的人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm the only one who knows that.

1045
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:24,560
至少我是唯一愿意付出行动的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.

1046
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:27,230
曾经
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}For a time...

1047
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:34,120
与我并肩战斗的你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you had that same will...

1048
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:38,120
也有着共同的信仰
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}as you fought by my side.

1049
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:40,040
女儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Daughter.

1050
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,500
我不是你的女儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm not your daughter.

1051
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,670
我痛恨你教给我的一切东西
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Everything I hate about myself you taught me.

1052
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,090
正是这些
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And, in doing so,

1053
01:07:50,090 --> 01:07:52,300
让你成为银河中最勇敢无畏的女人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy.

1054
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:58,100
所以我当时才派你去寻找灵魂原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.

1055
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:04,270
抱歉我让你失望了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1056
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,070
我的确很失望
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am disappointed.

1057
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:10,440
但不是因为你没有找到
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But not because you didn't find it.

1058
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,700
而是因为你找到了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But because you did.

1059
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,080
却对我说谎了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And you lied.

1060
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:37,260
星云
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Nebula.

1061
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,850
不要这样
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Don't do this.

1062
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,310
不久以前
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Some time ago,

1063
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:50,190
你妹妹潜入这架飞船来刺杀我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.

1064
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:51,280
求求你 别这样
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Please don't do this.

1065
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,530
她差点就成功了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And very nearly succeeded.

1066
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,610
所以我把她带到这里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So I brought her here.

1067
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,450
来谈一谈
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}To talk.

1068
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:08,500
停下 住手
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stop. Stop it.

1069
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:17,260
我以我的性命起誓
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I swear to you on my life.

1070
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:19,510
我没有找到灵魂原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I never found the Soul Stone.

1071
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,390
读取记忆档案
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Accessing memory files.

1072
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:26,810
你知道他打算做什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know what he's about to do.

1073
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:29,610
现在他终于准备好了 他要去掠夺原石了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones.

1074
01:09:29,610 --> 01:09:30,820
-全部原石 -他不可能得到全部的原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- All of them. - He can never get them all.

1075
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:31,900
他会的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He will!

1076
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:34,190
他不会的 星云
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He can't, Nebula.

1077
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:36,610
因为我找到了通往灵魂原石的地图
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Because I found the map to the Soul Stone...

1078
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:39,450
然后我把它烧成了灰 我烧掉了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and I burned it to ash. I burned it.

1079
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:46,290
你的坚强
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're strong.

1080
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:49,330
是我教的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Me.

1081
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:53,460
你的慷慨
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're generous.

1082
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,760
也是我教的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Me.

1083
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,430
但我从未教过你说谎
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But I never taught you to lie.

1084
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:03,140
难怪你撒谎如此拙劣
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's why you're so bad at it.

1085
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:09,730
灵魂原石在哪里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where is the Soul Stone?

1086
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:28,250
沃米尔星
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Vormir!

1087
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:47,850
灵魂原石在沃米尔星
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The stone is on Vormir.

1088
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:53,650
带路
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Show me.

1089
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,900
我是格鲁特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am Groot.

1090
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:58,280
尿在杯子里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tinkle in the cup.

1091
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,700
我们不看 有什么好看的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We're not looking. What's there to see?

1092
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:01,950
害羞什么 谁没见过小树枝
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig before.

1093
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:03,320
我是格鲁特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am Groot.

1094
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:04,450
小树 把杯子里的东西倒进太空
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tree, pour what's in the cup

1095
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:06,290
再继续尿在里面
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}out into space and go in the cup again.

1096
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:07,370
你会说格鲁特语
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You speak Groot?

1097
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:09,540
嗯 我在阿斯加德选修过
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.

1098
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:10,710
我是格鲁特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am Groot.

1099
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:12,830
我们快到的时候你就知道了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You'll know when we're close.

1100
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,590
尼德威阿尔的熔炉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Nidavellir's forge harnesses

1101
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:16,750
能收集中子星喷发的能量
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the blazing power of a neutron star.

1102
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:21,630
我的锤子就是在那里铸造的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's the birthplace of my hammer.

1103
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,220
它的力量十分惊人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's truly awesome.

1104
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:33,350
好吧 是时候尽船长的职责了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay, time to be the captain.

1105
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,530
你弟弟死了 是吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So, dead brother, huh?

1106
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,780
那确实挺伤感的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, that could be annoying.

1107
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,700
嗯 他以前也死过
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Well, he's been dead before.

1108
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,040
但是我觉得这次可能是真的了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But, no, this time I think it really might be true.

1109
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,660
你还提到过你姐姐和爸爸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And you said your sister and your dad?

1110
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:53,580
都死了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Both dead.

1111
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,710
那至少还有个妈妈是吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But still got a mom, though?

1112
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,040
被一个黑暗精灵杀了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Killed by a dark elf.

1113
01:11:57,090 --> 01:11:58,380
最好的朋友呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A best friend?

1114
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,630
心脏被刺穿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stabbed through the heart.

1115
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:06,260
你确定你要参加这次特别的刺杀行动吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You sure you're up to this particular murder mission?

1116
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:09,970
当然
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Absolutely.

1117
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:13,730
怒火 复仇 愤怒 失落 悔恨
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Rage and vengeance, anger, loss, regret...

1118
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:15,440
都是我的动力
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}they're all tremendous motivators.

1119
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:16,560
它们能让我保持头脑清醒
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They really clear the mind.

1120
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:18,820
所以我准备好了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So I'm good to go.

1121
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:21,530
没错 但我们说的可是灭霸
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, but this Thanos we're talkin' about...

1122
01:12:21,530 --> 01:12:23,900
他是最难对付的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}he's the toughest there is.

1123
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:26,070
-那是他没有跟我打过 -他有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Well, he's never fought me. - Yeah, he has.

1124
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:28,410
他没有跟我打过两次
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He's never fought me twice.

1125
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,330
还有别忘了 我要拿到新锤子了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.

1126
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:32,540
那锤子最好厉害一点
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It better be some hammer.

1127
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:39,670
我已经1500岁了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

1128
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:41,840
我杀过两倍于这个数字的敌人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I've killed twice as many enemies as that.

1129
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,880
他们每一个都想置我于死地
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And every one of them would've rather killed me,

1130
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,590
却没一个成功
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}but none succeeded.

1131
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:48,680
是命运要我活着
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm only alive because fate wants me alive.

1132
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:51,640
灭霸只是这些混蛋中的一个
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos is just the latest in a long line of bastards...

1133
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,680
他也将尝到我复仇的怒火
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and he'll be the latest to feel my vengeance.

1134
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,600
这也是命运的安排
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Fate wills it so.

1135
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,940


1136
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,810
那万一你错了呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And what if you're wrong?

1137
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:03,860
如果我错了 那
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If I'm wrong, then...

1138
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:06,740
我还有什么可失去的呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}what more could I lose?

1139
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:21,960
我能失去的还有很多
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I could lose a lot.

1140
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,050
我在世上还有很多牵挂
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Me, personally, I could lose a lot.

1141
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:28,890
好吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay.

1142
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:34,140
如果命运真的想让你杀死那个王八蛋
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If fate does want you to kill that crapsack...

1143
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:36,060
你就不能只有一只眼睛
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.

1144
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:38,520
-这是什么 -这看起来像什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- What's this? - What's it look like?

1145
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:41,150
一个混球在康特阿克夏星打赌输给了我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Some jerk lost a bet with me on Contraxia.

1146
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:42,530
他把眼睛给你了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He gave you his eye?

1147
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:43,780
才不是 他给了我100个筹码
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, he gave me 100 credits.

1148
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:46,740
我当晚溜进他的房间偷走了他的眼睛
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I snuck into his room later that night and stole his eye.

1149
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:49,950
谢谢 可爱的兔兔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thank you, sweet rabbit.

1150
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:50,950


1151
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:55,000
嗯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Huh?

1152
01:13:56,830 --> 01:13:58,120
噢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh.

1153
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,920
要是我的话就先洗一下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I would've washed that.

1154
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,590
唯一能把它带出康特阿克夏星的方法就是把它塞到我的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...

1155
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,840
嘿 我们到了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey, we're here!

1156
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,100
我觉得这东西不管用
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I don't think this thing works.

1157
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:12,430
我的眼前一片漆黑
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Everything seems dark.

1158
01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:16,560
不是眼睛的问题
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It ain't the eye.

1159
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:31,160
有哪里不对劲
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Something's wrong.

1160
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:33,620
这颗星球熄灭了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The star's gone out.

1161
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:35,950
行星环也停住了

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I hope these dwarves are better

1164

1165
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:07,230
或许他们搬家是因为意识到了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Maybe they realized that they live

1166
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:08,900
他们住在宇宙的一个垃圾堆里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}in a junk pile in the middle of space.

1167
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:11,910

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries.

1168
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,950
你说过灭霸有个无限手套 是吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?

1169
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:18,250
是的 怎么了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yes, why?

1170
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:20,460
它是长这样吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It look anything like that?

1171
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:25,750
我是格鲁特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am Groot.

1172
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:27,130
回分离舱上去
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Go back to the pod.

1173
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:32,180
伊特里 等等
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Eitri, wait!

1174
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:34,180
停下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stop!

1175
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,100
住手
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stop.

1176

索尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thor?

1177
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:42,980
这里发生了什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What happened here?

1178
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:46,150
你本应该保护我们的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You were supposed to protect us.

1179
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:48,980
阿斯加德本应该保护我们的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Asgard was supposed to protect us.

1180
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:51,150
阿斯加德被毁灭了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Asgard is destroyed.

1181
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:57,240
伊特里 那个手套 你们做了什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Eitri, the glove. What did you do?

1182
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:13,050
有三百个矮人住在这个行星环上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}300 dwarves lived on this ring.

1183
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:17,470
我以为只要我按他的要求做了 他们就会安全
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe.

1184
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:21,270
我铸造了他想要的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I made what he wanted.

1185
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:27,480
一个能够驾驭无限原石力量的装置
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones.

1186
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:34,610
然而 他还是杀了所有人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Then he killed everyone anyway.

1187
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:38,490
除了我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All except me.

01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:41,290
“你的生命属于你自己” 他说
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}"Your life is yours," He said.

1189

{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know Thor?

1257
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,000
对
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah.

1258
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,880
高个子 长得不帅 心理还有问题
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tall guy, not that good-looking, needed saving.

1259
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,430
他现在在哪里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where is he now?

1260
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,480
这就是计划吗 我们带着一块砖去拍他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This is the plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?

1261
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,860
这只是个模具
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's a mold.

1262
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,450
王之武器
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A king's weapon.

1263
01:21:25,450 --> 01:21:28,410
本是阿斯加德之最
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Meant to be the greatest in Asgard.

1264
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:31,450
理论上 它甚至可以召唤彩虹桥
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.

1265
01:21:31,450 --> 01:21:33,000
它有名字吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Did it have a name?

1266
01:21:34,210 --> 01:21:35,920
风暴之锤
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stormbreaker.

1267
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,000
有点中二
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's a bit much.

1268
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,130
所以我们要怎么把它造出来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So how do we make it?

1269
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:44,130
你要重新燃起熔炉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You'll have to restart the forge.

1270
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:47,300
唤醒一颗濒死星球的心脏
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Awaken the heart of a dying star.

1271
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:52,470
兔子 去启动分离舱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1272
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:58,310
这星球到底经历了什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The hell happened to this planet?

1273
01:21:58,310 --> 01:22:00,230
偏离了轴线八度
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's eight degrees off its axis.

1274
01:22:00,230 --> 01:22:02,400
引力到处都是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gravitational pull is all over the place.

1275
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:07,490
是啊 我们有一个优势 他会来找我们的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us.

1276
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:10,320
我们就利用这点 好了 我有个计划
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We'll use it. All right, I have a plan.

1277
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,660
或者至少是初步计划
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Or at least the beginnings of one.

1278
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,160
很简单 我们把他引过来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's pretty simple. We draw him in,

1279
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,500
合力擒住他 拿走我们需要的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}pin him down, get what we need.

1280
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,290
我们明显不能和这家伙周旋纠缠
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy.

1281
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:18,000
我们只需要拿到手套
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We just want the gauntlet.

1282
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,330
你是在打哈欠吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Are you yawning?

1283
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:22,630
在我解释计划的这个时候 哈
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh?

1284
01:22:22,630 --> 01:22:24,460
你有听到我说了什么吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Did you hear what I said?

1285
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:27,010
在你说“我们需要一个计划”之后 我就没再听了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I stopped listening after you said, "We need a plan."

1286
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:28,050
好吧 光头先生沉浸在自己的世界里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.

1287
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:31,180
“别搞砸事情”不是他们的作风
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}See, "Not winging it" Isn't really what they do.

1288
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:32,930
呃 那他们的实际作风是什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, what exactly is it that they do?

1289
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:34,520
拉风头 抢仇恨
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Kick names, take ass.

1290
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,930
是的 没错
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, that's right.

1291
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,320
算了 先都聚过来吧 拜托了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All right, just get over here, please.

1292
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,360
爵士先生 你能让你的人围过来吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?

1293
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,530
什么“爵士先生” 叫我星爵就行
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

1294
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,660
我们要联合起来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We gotta coalesce.

1295
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:54,490
因为如果我们全都迎面而上 是勇气可嘉的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude...

1296
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:57,040
大哥 别跟我们说什么勇气
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Dude, don't call us plucky.

1297
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,540
我们不懂那是什么意思
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We don't know what it means.

1298
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:01,330
好吧 我们都很乐观 没错 我喜欢你的计划
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All right, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan.

1299
01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:04,040
不过它很烂 所以让我来定计划
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Except it sucks, so let me do the plan...

1300
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,090
这样我们的计划没准会很棒
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and that way it might be really good.

1301
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:08,220
告诉他你是怎么通过尬舞拯救宇宙的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.

1302
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:10,430
-什么尬舞 -没什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- What dance-off? - It's nothing.

1303
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:13,530
《浑身是劲》：1984年上映的美国剧情电影

1304
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:11,590
就像《浑身是劲》电影里那样吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Like in Footloose, the movie?

1305
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:13,550
没错 就跟《浑身是劲》一样
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Exactly like Footloose.

1306
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:15,260
它还是史上最棒的电影吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Is it still the greatest movie in history?

1307
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:16,520
它从来就不是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It never was.

1308
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:17,600
别让他来劲 好吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Don't encourage this, all right?

1309
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:20,620
飞侠哥顿：1980年美国动作科幻电影中的人物

1310
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,100
-好吧 -这位飞侠哥顿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Okay. - We're getting no help

1311
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,640
-显然帮不上我们什么 -飞侠哥顿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- from Flash Gordon here. - Flash Gordon?

1312
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,400
顺便一说 那可是称赞
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}By the way, that's a compliment.

1313
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,150
别忘了 我是半个人类
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Don't forget, I'm half human.

1314
01:23:24,150 --> 01:23:25,570
所以那一半的我是蠢的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So that 50% of me that's stupid...

1315
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:28,070
而你们就是百分百的蠢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}that's 100% you.

1316
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:29,360
你的数学真令我震惊
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Your math is blowing my mind.

1317
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,570
打扰一下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Excuse me.

1318
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:35,120
但你们的朋友经常那样吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But does your friend often do that?

1319
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:38,700
斯特兰奇 你还好吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Strange, we all right?

1320
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:50,260
你回来了 你没事
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're back. You're all right.

1321
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:52,470
-嗨 -嘿 刚刚是怎么回事
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Hi. - Hey, what was that?

1322
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:57,100
我顺着时间前进 去浏览未来的可能
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I went forward in time to view alternate futures.

1323
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,600
去看即将来临的大战
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}To see all the possible outcomes

1324
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,480
所有可能发生的结局
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}of the coming conflict.

1325
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:02,690
你看到了多少种结局
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How many did you see?

1326
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:05,110
一千四百万六百零五种
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}14,000,605.

1327
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:08,150
我们赢了多少次
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How many did we win?

1328
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:14,120
一次
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}One.

1329
01:24:26,690 --> 01:24:30,900
{\fn方正宋黑简体\blur0.4\c&HC8C8C8&\fs90\b0\fad(1200,1200)\pos(640,252.533)}沃米尔星

1330
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:39,010
为了你妹妹小命
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The stone had better be up there.

1331
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,770
原石最好在那里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}For your sister's sake.

1332
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:08,500
欢迎 灭霸 阿拉尔斯之子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1333
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:14,090
卡魔拉 灭霸之女
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1334
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:15,340
你认识我们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know us?

1335
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:20,390
认识每一个来到这里的人就是我的诅咒
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It is my curse to know all who journey here.

1336
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:22,140
灵魂原石在哪里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where is the Soul Stone?

1337
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:25,140
你该知道
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You should know...

1338
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:28,270
它会让你付出可怕的代价
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}it extracts a terrible price.

1339
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,190
我准备好了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am prepared.

1340
01:25:33,570 --> 01:25:36,110
一开始 我们都这样以为
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We all think that at first.

1341
01:25:40,530 --> 01:25:42,790
但我们都错了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We are all wrong.

1342
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:56,880
你为什么对这个地方如此熟悉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How is it you know this place so well?

1343
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:01,720
一百年前 我也试图寻找无限原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones.

1344
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:04,600
甚至已经有一颗在我的手上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I even held one in my hand.

1345
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:08,770
但它驱逐了我 将我流放至此
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But it cast me out, banished me here.

1346
01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:12,820
指引他人搜寻我无法拥有的珍宝
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.

1347
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:24,540
你所寻找的就在你面前
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What you seek lies in front of you.

1348
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,580
你所畏惧的也是如此
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}As does what you fear.

1349
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:30,380
这是什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What's this?

1350
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:31,920
代价
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The price.

1351
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:37,630
在所有无限原石中 灵魂原石有着特殊的地位
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Soul holds a special place among the Infinity Stones.

1352
01:26:37,630 --> 01:26:41,720
可以说 它有一定的智慧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You might say it has a certain wisdom.

1353
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:45,220
告诉我 它需要什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tell me what it needs.

1354
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:48,770
为了确保拥有它的人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}To ensure that whoever possesses it...

1355
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:51,440
理解它的能量
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}understands its power...

1356
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:56,320
这颗原石需要献祭
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the stone demands a sacrifice.

1357
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,280
献祭什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Of what?

1358
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,320
为了获得灵魂原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}In order to take the stone,

1359
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,660
你必须失去你所爱的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you must lose that which you love.

1360
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:06,830
一个灵魂
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A soul...

1361
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:08,790
换取另一个灵魂
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}for a soul.

1362
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,810
我这一生 都梦想着有一天
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All my life, I dreamed of a day...

1363
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:29,310
有一个时刻
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}a moment...

1364
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,650
你会遭到报应
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}when you got what you deserved.

1365
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:37,230
但我总会失望
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And I was always so disappointed.

1366
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:42,280
但是现在
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But now...

1367
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:49,330
你杀戮 折磨他人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You kill and torture...

1368
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:53,290
还称之为仁慈
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and you call it mercy.

1369
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:59,420
宇宙给了你判决
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The universe has judged you.

1370
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:05,470
你想让它给你奖赏 而它对你说不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You asked it for a prize, and it told you no.

1371
01:28:06,890 --> 01:28:08,520
你失败了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You failed.

1372
01:28:09,810 --> 01:28:11,690
你想知道为什么吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And do you wanna know why?

1373
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:14,520
因为你什么都不爱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Because you love nothing.

1374
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:16,820
谁都不爱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No one.

1375
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:23,660
不对
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No.

1376
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:29,370
真的吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Really?

1377
01:28:30,370 --> 01:28:31,460
哭了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tears?

1378
01:28:32,290 --> 01:28:34,250
这眼泪不是为他自己而流
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They're not for him.

1379
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:49,640
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No.

1380
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,560
这不是爱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This isn't love.

1381
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:56,020
我曾忽视过自己的命运
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I ignored my destiny once.

1382
01:28:58,570 --> 01:29:00,730
我不能重蹈覆辙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I cannot do that again.

1383
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:04,610
即使是为了你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Even for you.

1384
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:31,100
我很抱歉 小家伙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sorry, little one.

1385
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:36,350
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No!

1386
01:31:13,830 --> 01:31:16,830
降低高度到2600 朝0-3-0坐标前进
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1387
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:18,160
我希望你没搞错
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I hope you're right about this.

1388
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:21,080
不然我们可就提前着陆了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to.

1389
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:38,230
当你说我们要向世界
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}When you said we were going to open Wakanda

1390
01:31:38,230 --> 01:31:39,640
开放瓦坎达的时候
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to the rest of the world...

1391
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:41,940
我可没想到是这样子的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}this is not what I imagined.

1392
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:44,020
你以为是什么样子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And what did you imagine?

1393
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:45,480
参加奥林匹克运动会
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The Olympics.

1394
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,070
或许再开个星巴克
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Maybe even a Starbucks.

1395
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:02,880
我们该行礼吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Should we bow?

1396
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,540
当然了 他可是国王
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, he's a king.

1397
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:06,550
似乎我总是在向你道谢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Seems like I'm always thanking you for something.

1398
01:32:07,710 --> 01:32:09,880
你在干什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What are you doing?

1399
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:12,010
我们这里不用行礼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, we don't do that here.

1400
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:14,550
所以 我们会面临多大规模的战斗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So how big of an assault should we expect?

1401
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:17,680
呃 陛下 我想你们要做好准备应对一场激烈的战斗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, sir, I think you should expect quite a big assault.

1402
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:18,720
我们有多少兵力
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How we looking?

1403
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:20,770
我们这边出战的有我的国王护卫队
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You will have my Kingsguard,

1404
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:24,730
边境部落 女子皇家亲卫队 还有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...

1405
01:32:24,730 --> 01:32:27,650
还有一位处于半稳定状态的百岁老人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And a semi-stable 100-year-old man.

1406
01:32:30,570 --> 01:32:31,820
你怎么样 巴基
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How you been, Buck?

1407
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:34,910
还行吧 毕竟世界末日都要来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Uh, not bad, for the end of the world.

1408
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,090
哇
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Whoa.

1409
01:32:48,090 --> 01:32:50,710
原石是多形态结构的水晶
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The structure is polymorphic.

1410
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:53,930
没错 我们必须对每个神经元进行非序列性连接
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.

1411
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:55,890
你们为什么不对神经元突触
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Why didn't you just reprogram

1412
01:32:55,890 --> 01:32:57,970
进行重新编码 使其能协调地工作
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}the synapses to work collectively?

1413
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:02,770
因为我们没想到这一点
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Because we didn't think of it.

1414
01:33:02,770 --> 01:33:04,150
我相信你们已经尽力了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sure you did your best.

1415
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:06,270
你能做到吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Can you do it?

1416
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:09,820
能 但这里有超过两万亿的神经元
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here.

1417
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:13,280
一点偏差就会导致一连串的回路故障
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures.

1418
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,530
我需要时间 哥哥
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It will take time, brother.

1419
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:17,200
多长时间
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How long?

1420
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:18,620
越长越好
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}As long as you can give me.

1421
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,290
有外来物正在侵入大气层
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Something's entered the atmosphere.

1422
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:44,600
队长 我们这里有情况
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.

1423
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:55,610
天呐 我爱死这个地方了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}God, I love this place.

1424
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:57,780
先别急着欢呼 伙计们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys.

1425
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:59,700
穹顶外有更多的攻击要来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We got more incoming outside the dome.

1426
01:34:18,890 --> 01:34:19,970
太迟了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's too late.

1427
01:34:21,010 --> 01:34:22,850
我们必须现在就毁掉原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We need to destroy the stone now.

1428
01:34:22,850 --> 01:34:24,680
幻视 乖乖躺回桌上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Vision, get your ass back on the table.

1429
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:26,100
我们会拖住他们的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We will hold them off.

1430
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:29,770
旺达 一旦原石离开了他的头
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wanda, as soon as that stone's out of his head...

1431
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:30,770
你就立刻毁了它
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you blow it to hell.

1432
01:34:31,110 --> 01:34:32,320
我会的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I will.

1433
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:35,150
疏散全城 全面戒备
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Evacuate the city. Engage all defenses.

1434
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:37,320
给这个男人一块盾牌
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And get this man a shield.

1435
01:34:47,870 --> 01:34:49,000
我觉得
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I don't think

1436
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,380
你不懂这里的科学系统如何运作
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you get the scientifics here.

1437
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:52,920
这些行星环庞大无比 想让它们动起来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving...

1438
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,300
你需要更大的东西
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you're gonna need something a lot bigger

1439
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:55,670
才能拉动它们
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}to yank 'em loose.

1440
01:34:55,670 --> 01:34:57,840
-交给我 -交给你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- Leave that to me. - Leave it to you?

1441
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:01,010
哥们 你是在太空里 你手里只有一条绳子和一个
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a...

1442
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:10,350
发动引擎
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Fire the engines!

1443
01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:30,670
加大火力 兔子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}More power, rabbit!

1444
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:03,870
干得好 孩子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Well done, boy.

1445
01:36:05,490 --> 01:36:07,450
这才是尼德威阿尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's Nidavellir.

1446
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:29,020
该死
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Damn it.

1447
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:30,810
“该死” “该死”是什么意思
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}"Damn it"? What's "Damn it"?

1448
01:36:30,810 --> 01:36:32,190
机械装置出故障了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The mechanism is crippled.

1449
01:36:32,190 --> 01:36:33,810
-什么 -光圈闭合的话
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- What? - With the iris closed,

1450
01:36:33,810 --> 01:36:34,980
我就没办法加热金属
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I can't heat the metal.

1451
01:36:34,980 --> 01:36:36,770
加热需要多长时间
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How long will it take to heat it?

1452
01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:39,070
几分钟 或者更久 为什么这么问
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

1453
01:36:41,070 --> 01:36:42,240
我去撑开它
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm gonna hold it open.

1454
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,490
你这是在自杀
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's suicide.

1455
01:36:43,490 --> 01:36:45,990
不带那把斧子去迎战灭霸也是自杀
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}So is facing Thanos without that axe.

1456
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:56,840
你感觉怎么样 布鲁斯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How we looking, Bruce?

1457
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,750
挺好 我觉得我开始适应了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

1458
01:37:02,010 --> 01:37:04,140
哇 太炫了 大家伙儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wow! This is amazing, man.

1459
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:06,140
感觉就像不用变身就成了浩克
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's like being the Hulk without actually...

1460
01:37:09,930 --> 01:37:12,100
我没事 我没事
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm okay. I'm okay.

1461
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:14,560
我发现有两个热信号
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I've got two heat signatures

1462
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:15,770
正在突破林木线
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}breaking through the tree line.

1463
01:37:44,130 --> 01:37:46,840
感谢你们能与我们并肩作战
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thank you for standing with us.

1464
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:10,580
你的另一个丑朋友呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where's your other friend?

1465
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:13,080
你们会为他偿命的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You will pay for his life with yours.

1466
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:17,080
灭霸将会拿到那颗原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos will have that stone.

1467
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:18,580
想都别想
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's not gonna happen.

1468
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:21,130
你们现在是在瓦坎达
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You are in Wakanda now.

1469
01:38:21,130 --> 01:38:24,510
灭霸只会得到灰烬和鲜血
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.

1470
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:29,890
我们的血多得是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We have blood to spare.

1471
01:38:41,150 --> 01:38:42,610
他们投降了吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They surrender?

1472
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,490
没有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Not exactly.

1473
01:39:11,470 --> 01:39:12,970
什么鬼东西
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What the hell?

1474
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:17,520
看来我们惹毛她了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Looks like we pissed her off.

1475
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:29,910
他们是在自杀
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They're killing themselves.

1476
01:40:06,110 --> 01:40:07,650
你看到那些怪物的牙了吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You see the teeth on those things?

1477
01:40:07,650 --> 01:40:08,690
好了 退后 山姆
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All right, back up, Sam.

1478
01:40:08,690 --> 01:40:09,900
你会烤焦你的翅膀的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're gonna get your wings singed.

1479
01:40:22,330 --> 01:40:23,710
队长 如果这些怪物绕过防护线
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Cap, if these things circle the perimeter

1480
01:40:23,710 --> 01:40:24,880
从我们后面攻进来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and get in behind us...

1481
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,210
那可就直接扑上幻视了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}there's nothing between them and Vision.

1482
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:29,220
那么我们最好把他们牵制在我们跟前
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Then we better keep 'em in front of us.

1483
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:30,470
我们该怎么做
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How do we do that?

1484
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:34,470
我们打开屏障
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We open the barrier.

1485
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:41,230
听我的指令 打开西北部第十七号屏障
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen.

1486
01:40:41,230 --> 01:40:43,230
请确认指令 陛下
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Requesting confirmation, My King.

1487
01:40:43,230 --> 01:40:45,060
您刚刚是说打开屏障吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You said open the barrier?

1488
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:46,440
听我的指令
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}On my signal.

1489
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:48,360
这会是瓦坎达的末日
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This will be the end of Wakanda.

1490
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:53,160
那这也将是史上最辉煌的落幕
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Then it will be the noblest ending in history.

1491
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:07,590
瓦坎达万岁
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wakanda forever!

1492
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:21,060
就现在
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Now!

1493
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:52,800
还要多久 苏睿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}How much longer, Shuri?

1494
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,550
我才刚刚开始 哥哥
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I've barely begun, brother.

1495
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:56,430
你最好加快速度
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You might want to pick up the pace.

1496
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:05,480
天父啊 请赐予我力量
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Allfathers, give me strength.

1497
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:07,480
你明白吗 孩子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You understand, boy?

1498
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:10,480
你将会承受一颗星球的全部力量
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're about to take the full force of a star.

1499
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,490
你会死的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It'll kill you.

1500
01:42:13,490 --> 01:42:15,650
真死了再说
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Only if I die.

1501
01:42:16,110 --> 01:42:17,490
没错
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yes.

1502
01:42:17,490 --> 01:42:20,330
这就是“死”的意思
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's what killing you means.

1503
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:50,230
坚持 坚持住 索尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

1504
01:43:40,610 --> 01:43:42,580
索尔 说句话 拜托
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thor! Say something. Come on.

1505
01:43:43,530 --> 01:43:44,540
索尔 你还好吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thor, you okay?

1506
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:51,630
我觉得他快死了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I think he's dying.

1507
01:43:51,630 --> 01:43:53,590
他需要这把斧头
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He needs the axe!

1508
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,420
斧柄在哪里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where's the handle?

1509
01:43:59,470 --> 01:44:01,760
树人 快帮我找找斧柄
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tree, help me find the handle!

1510
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:12,830
它们的数量太多了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}There's too many of 'em!

1511
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:42,740
你们要大祸临头了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You guys are so screwed now!

1512
01:45:45,990 --> 01:45:48,030
给我把灭霸叫来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Bring me Thanos!

1513
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:22,360
啊 没错
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, yeah.

1514
01:46:25,490 --> 01:46:27,490
灭霸人如其名
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're much more of a Thanos.

1515
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:31,910
看来乌木喉已经死了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I take it the Maw is dead.

1516
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:36,710
今天伤亡惨重
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This day extracts a heavy toll.

1517
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:40,960
不过 他还是完成了他的任务
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Still, he accomplished his mission.

1518
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:42,590
你会后悔的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You may regret that.

1519
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:44,800
他让你和至尊法师
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He brought you face-to-face

1520
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,340
正面对决
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}with the Master of the Mystic Arts.

1521
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:51,850
你认为他把你带到了哪儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And where do you think he brought you?

1522
01:46:52,930 --> 01:46:55,680
让我猜猜 你的家乡吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Let me guess. Your home?

1523
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:01,400
曾经是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It was.

1524
01:47:04,030 --> 01:47:05,570
过去它是那么的美
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And it was beautiful.

1525
01:47:08,070 --> 01:47:10,740
泰坦像许多其他的星球那样
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Titan was like most planets.

1526
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:13,790
人口太多 资源却不够
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Too many mouths, not enough to go around.

1527
01:47:13,790 --> 01:47:17,000
当我们面临灭绝的时候 我提出了一个解决办法
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.

1528
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,920
大屠杀
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Genocide.

1529
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:24,000
随机 公正 无论贫富贵贱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike.

1530
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:28,180
他们说我是疯子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They called me a madman.

1531
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:30,590
但我所预言的最终却成真了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And what I predicted came to pass.

1532
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:35,350
那恭喜你了 你可真是个预言家
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Congratulations, you're a prophet.

1533
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:37,100
我是个幸存者
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm a survivor.

1534
01:47:37,140 --> 01:47:39,600
一个想杀死亿万人的幸存者
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Who wants to murder trillions.

1535
01:47:39,650 --> 01:47:43,820
集齐六块原石 我只需要轻松地打个响指
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers.

1536
01:47:43,820 --> 01:47:48,610
他们就不复存在了 这是我的仁慈
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They would all cease to exist. I call that mercy.

1537
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:52,070
然后呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}And then what?

1538
01:47:53,530 --> 01:47:55,790
我才能最终得到安歇
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'd finally rest...

1539
01:47:55,790 --> 01:48:00,000
看着太阳在一个对我充满感激的宇宙里升起
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.

1540
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,500
只有意志最坚强的人才能做出如此艰难的选择
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}The hardest choices require the strongest wills.

1541
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:09,090
你马上就会知道我们的意志也跟你的一样强
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I think you'll find our will equal to yours.

1542
01:48:10,630 --> 01:48:11,640
我们的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Our?

1543
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:19,140
小菜一碟 奎尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Piece of cake, Quill.

1544
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:21,560
是啊 如果你只是想惹毛他的话
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off.

1545
01:48:59,730 --> 01:49:01,060
嘣
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Boom!

1546
01:49:01,060 --> 01:49:03,850
不要让他合上拳头
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Don't let him close his fist.

1547
01:49:08,030 --> 01:49:09,030
看我的魔法
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Magic.

1548
01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:10,690
更多魔法
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}More magic.

1549
01:49:11,570 --> 01:49:12,570
魔法加一个飞踢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Magic with a kick.

1550
01:49:13,070 --> 01:49:14,070
魔法加一个
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Magic with a...

1551
01:49:15,530 --> 01:49:16,780
臭虫子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Insect!

1552
01:49:54,110 --> 01:49:55,570
原来是你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Well, well.

1553
01:49:55,570 --> 01:49:56,740
你早该杀了我的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You should've killed me.

1554
01:49:56,740 --> 01:49:58,580
那可就浪费了你身上的零件了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It would've been a waste of parts!

1555
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,170
卡魔拉在哪
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where's Gamora?

1556
01:50:46,370 --> 01:50:47,750
控制住他了吗 不要放松
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Is he under? Don't let up.

1557
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:50,380
快一点 他太强壮了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Be quick. He is very strong.

1558
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:52,760
帕克 快来这儿帮忙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Parker, help! Get over here.

1559
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:55,010
她坚持不了多久 快动手
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

1560
01:51:00,390 --> 01:51:01,720
我们得掰开他的手指才能拿下来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We gotta open his fingers to get it off.

1561
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:02,890
我还以为你很难对付呢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I thought you'd be hard to catch.

1562
01:51:02,890 --> 01:51:04,060
以防大家不知道 这是我的计划
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}For the record, this was my plan.

1563
01:51:05,310 --> 01:51:07,100
现在没那么嚣张了吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're not so strong now, huh?

1564
01:51:07,690 --> 01:51:09,360
卡魔拉在哪
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where is Gamora?

1565
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:11,650
是我的卡魔拉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}My Gamora.

1566
01:51:11,650 --> 01:51:13,940
你放屁
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, bullshit!

1567
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:15,150
她在哪
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where is she?

1568
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:17,660
他现在极度痛苦
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He is in anguish.

1569
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:20,320
很好
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Good.

1570
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:23,200
他 他在哀悼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He... He mourns.

1571
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:26,910
这个怪物有什么好哀悼的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What does this monster have to mourn?

1572
01:51:27,670 --> 01:51:28,750
卡魔拉
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Gamora.

1573
01:51:32,670 --> 01:51:34,000
什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What?

1574
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,090
他带她去了沃米尔星
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He took her to Vormir.

1575
01:51:36,090 --> 01:51:38,050
然后他带着灵魂原石回来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He came back with the Soul Stone.

1576
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:40,300
她却没回来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But she didn't.

1577
01:51:42,220 --> 01:51:46,270
奎尔 你现在得冷静下来 你明白吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now. You understand?

1578
01:51:46,270 --> 01:51:49,850
别别别 别动手 我们马上就要摘下来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Don't, don't. Don't engage. We almost got this off!

1579
01:51:51,020 --> 01:51:52,020
告诉我她在撒谎
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tell me she's lying.

1580
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:57,240
混蛋 告诉我你没杀她
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Asshole, tell me you didn't do it!

1581
01:51:58,820 --> 01:52:02,160
我必须那么做
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I had to.

1582
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:04,370
不 你没有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, you didn't.

1583
01:52:04,370 --> 01:52:06,200
不 你没有
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, you didn't.

1584
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:11,460
-不 你没有杀她 -奎尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- No, you didn't! - Quill!

1585
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:14,040
嘿 住手 住手 住手
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop!

1586
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:15,300
住手 住手
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hey, stop! Stop!

1587
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:17,050
快掉了 快掉了 我摘下来了 我摘下来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's coming, it's coming. I got it, I got it!

1588
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:21,720
不 天呐
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, God.

1589
01:53:20,110 --> 01:53:23,820
来尝尝我的子弹吧 太空狗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come and get some, space dogs!

1590
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:29,290
来呀 尝尝我的厉害
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come on! Get some! Get some!

1591
01:53:29,290 --> 01:53:31,410
来呀 来打呀
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come on! Get some!

1592
01:53:31,410 --> 01:53:34,130
-你的枪多少钱 -不卖
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- How much for the gun? - Not for sale.

1593
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:36,040
好吧 那手臂多少钱
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Okay. How much for the arm?

1594
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:40,010
行吧 我会自己搞到手的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, I'll get that arm.

1595
01:53:48,850 --> 01:53:50,140
新发型吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}New haircut?

1596
01:53:50,140 --> 01:53:51,390
你留的那胡子是学我的吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Noticed you've copied my beard.

1597
01:53:53,890 --> 01:53:55,900
顺便说下 这是我朋友 小树
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}By the way, this is a friend of mine, Tree.

1598
01:53:56,810 --> 01:53:58,770
我是格鲁特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am Groot.

1599
01:53:59,570 --> 01:54:01,490
我是史蒂夫·罗杰斯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am Steve Rogers.

1600
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:23,340
撤退 撤退 快
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Fall back! Fall back, now!

1601
01:54:32,850 --> 01:54:35,100
山姆 瞄准左翼开火
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.

1602
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:36,190
正在这么做
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm doing it.

1603
01:55:00,130 --> 01:55:01,840
她怎么不早点下来帮忙
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Why was she up there all this time?

1604
01:55:02,590 --> 01:55:05,510
引她出来了 去抢原石吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}She's on the field. Take it.

1605
01:55:37,210 --> 01:55:39,380
伙伴们 幻视那边有危险了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Guys, we got a Vision situation here.

1606
01:55:42,090 --> 01:55:44,210
快去幻视那边
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Somebody get to Vision!

1607
01:55:44,210 --> 01:55:46,050
-我去帮他 -我马上到
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}- I got him! - On my way.

1608
01:55:51,350 --> 01:55:54,350
他会孤独地死去 你也是
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He'll die alone. As will you.

1609
01:55:54,350 --> 01:55:55,600
她可没有落单
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}She's not alone.

1610
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:23,670
住手 你们休想
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, no, you don't.

1611
01:56:23,670 --> 01:56:25,380
这次可不会像在纽约时一样 伙计
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This isn't gonna be like New York, pal.

1612
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:27,970
这套装甲曾经可是把浩克都揍扁过
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This suit's already kicked the crap outta the Hulk.

1613
01:56:27,970 --> 01:56:29,010
什么 不 不要
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What? No! No!

1614
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:35,310
伙计们 幻视现在需要支援
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Guys! Vision needs backup, now!

1615
01:56:37,310 --> 01:56:39,060
浩克 浩克
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hulk? Hulk,

1616
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:41,150
我知道你喜欢在最后关头出场
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I know you like making your entrance at the last second.

1617
01:56:41,150 --> 01:56:43,650
现在就是了 哥们 现在就是最后关头
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second.

1618
01:56:48,190 --> 01:56:49,650
浩克 浩克
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hulk! Hulk!

1619
01:56:50,530 --> 01:56:51,530
浩克
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hulk!

1620
01:56:52,660 --> 01:56:55,160
我不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No!

1621
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:58,080
去你的 你这个绿色大饭桶
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, screw you, you big, green asshole!

1622
01:56:58,080 --> 01:56:59,250
我自己上
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'll do it myself!

1623
01:57:00,160 --> 01:57:02,040
来呀
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come on! Yeah!

1624
01:57:14,350 --> 01:57:16,060
拜拜咯
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}See ya!

1625
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:30,110
浩克 我们得好好谈谈了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.

1626
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:43,000
我还以为你有多厉害呢 机器人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I thought you were formidable, machine.

1627
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:46,380
但你却要死了 像所有凡人一样
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But you're dying, like any man.

1628
01:57:55,050 --> 01:57:56,260
快离开这里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Get outta here!

1629
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:00,640
快走
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Go!

1630
01:58:19,410 --> 01:58:21,160
真恶心
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That was really gross.

1631
01:58:48,270 --> 01:58:49,360
我不是叫你走了吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I thought I told you to go.

1632
01:58:50,820 --> 01:58:52,780
我们从不以命换命 这是队长你说的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We don't trade lives, Captain.

1633
01:59:04,210 --> 01:59:06,460
我接住你了 我接住你了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I got you. I got you.

1634
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:08,460
不好意思我记不住大家的名字
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names.

1635
01:59:53,670 --> 01:59:55,340
你的花样还真多 巫师
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're full of tricks, wizard.

1636
01:59:57,340 --> 02:00:00,260
但你却一次也没用过你最强大的武器
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yet you never once used your greatest weapon.

1637
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:04,680
假的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}A fake.

1638
02:00:12,570 --> 02:00:16,280
你要是再拿月球砸我 我就要发狂了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna lose it.

1639
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:17,530
史塔克
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stark.

1640
02:00:17,530 --> 02:00:18,610
你认识我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You know me?

1641
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:20,820
当然认识
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I do.

1642
02:00:20,870 --> 02:00:24,160
你可不是唯一一个被知识诅咒的人
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.

1643
02:00:24,870 --> 02:00:26,370
我唯一的诅咒就是你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}My only curse is you.

1644
02:00:28,830 --> 02:00:29,830
来吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Come on!

1645
02:00:57,780 --> 02:00:59,740
忙活那么久就为了让我出点血
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}All that for a drop of blood.

1646
02:01:43,780 --> 02:01:45,620
你赢得了我的尊敬 史塔克
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You have my respect, Stark.

1647
02:01:47,370 --> 02:01:50,540
等我成功后 一半的人类还会活着
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive.

1648
02:01:55,960 --> 02:01:58,210
我希望他们会记得你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I hope they remember you.

1649
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:08,970
住手
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Stop.

1650
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:16,400
放他一条生路
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Spare his life...

1651
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:19,820
我就把原石交给你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}and I will give you the stone.

1652
02:02:23,490 --> 02:02:24,700
别耍花招
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No tricks.

1653
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:30,540
不要
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Don't.

1654
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:23,670
还剩一颗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}One to go.

1655
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:34,890
他去哪儿了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where is he?

1656
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:45,400
我们输了吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Did we just lose?

1657
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:51,080
你为什么要那么做
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Why would you do that?

1658
02:03:54,540 --> 02:03:56,750
我们已经没戏唱了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We're in the endgame now.

1659
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:24,110
你没事吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Are you okay?

1660
02:04:26,030 --> 02:04:27,860
怎么了 怎么回事
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What? What is it?

1661
02:04:29,910 --> 02:04:31,030
他来了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}He's here.

1662
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:45,090
所有人注意 我的位置 有敌人来袭
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Everyone, on my position. We have incoming.

1663
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:49,840
什么鬼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What the hell?

1664
02:05:15,490 --> 02:05:16,490
队长
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Cap.

1665
02:05:17,080 --> 02:05:18,660
就是他
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}That's him.

1666
02:05:20,660 --> 02:05:23,130
全体集中注意 保持警惕
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1667
02:05:47,730 --> 02:05:48,730
旺达
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Wanda.

1668
02:05:49,820 --> 02:05:51,200
是时候了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's time.

1669
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:52,530
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No.

1670
02:05:52,530 --> 02:05:54,820
他们阻止不了他 旺达 但我们可以
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can.

1671
02:05:54,820 --> 02:05:56,490
看着我
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Look at me.

1672
02:05:56,490 --> 02:05:57,700
你有能力摧毁原石
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You have the power to destroy the stone.

1673
02:05:57,700 --> 02:05:58,790
不行
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Don't.

1674
02:05:58,790 --> 02:05:59,870
你必须得这么做 旺达 求你了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You must do it. Wanda, please.

1675
02:06:01,870 --> 02:06:04,540
我们已经没有时间了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}We are out of time.

1676
02:06:05,170 --> 02:06:06,630
我做不到
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I can't.

1677
02:06:06,630 --> 02:06:07,960
不 你可以的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yes, you can.

1678
02:06:08,670 --> 02:06:09,880
你能做到
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You can.

1679
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:13,720
如果他得到了原石 宇宙中一半的人都会死
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.

1680
02:06:16,010 --> 02:06:17,640
这不公平
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's not fair.

1681
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:20,470
这不该由你来做 但只能如此
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It shouldn't be you, but it is.

1682
02:06:22,230 --> 02:06:23,810
没关系的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's all right.

1683
02:06:25,150 --> 02:06:26,900
你不会伤害到我的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You could never hurt me.

1684
02:06:35,950 --> 02:06:37,780
我感受到你了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I just feel you.

1685
02:08:00,910 --> 02:08:01,990
没事的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's all right.

1686
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:13,210
没关系的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}It's all right.

1687
02:08:17,680 --> 02:08:18,760
我爱你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I love you.

1688
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,120
我明白你的感受 我的孩子
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I understand, my child.

1689
02:08:51,750 --> 02:08:53,250
比任何人都明白
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Better than anyone.

1690
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,920
你永远也不会懂
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You could never.

1691
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:04,810
我今天所失去的远比你想象的还要多
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Today, I lost more than you can know.

1692
02:09:06,430 --> 02:09:09,140
但我现在没有时间去哀悼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}But now is no time to mourn.

1693
02:09:11,350 --> 02:09:15,360
现在没有时间
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Now is no time at all.

1694
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:39,800
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No!

1695
02:10:37,770 --> 02:10:39,150
我告诉过你
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I told you...

1696
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:42,320
你会偿命的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}you'd die for that.

1697
02:10:56,790 --> 02:10:58,420
你应该
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You should have...

1698
02:11:01,130 --> 02:11:02,470
你应该
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You should...

1699
02:11:05,090 --> 02:11:08,300
你应该朝着我的头砍
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}You should have gone for the head.

1700
02:11:10,220 --> 02:11:11,220
不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No!

1701
02:11:44,550 --> 02:11:45,930
女儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Daughter?

1702
02:11:53,430 --> 02:11:54,930
你做到了吗
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Did you do it?

1703
02:11:56,850 --> 02:11:57,850
是的
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Yes.

1704
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:07,860
代价是什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What did it cost?

1705
02:12:11,450 --> 02:12:13,040
我的一切
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Everything.

1706
02:12:23,250 --> 02:12:24,880
你做了什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What did you do?

1707
02:12:26,090 --> 02:12:27,510
你刚刚做了什么
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}What'd you do?

1708
02:12:41,230 --> 02:12:42,520
他去哪儿了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where'd he go?

1709
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:46,610
索尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Thor.

1710
02:12:49,950 --> 02:12:51,570
他去哪了
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Where'd he go?

1711
02:12:51,570 --> 02:12:52,990
史蒂夫
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Steve?

1712
02:13:27,650 --> 02:13:30,570
起来 将军 起来
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Up, General. Up!

1713
02:13:30,570 --> 02:13:32,160
我们不能死在这里
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}This is no place to die.

1714
02:13:47,130 --> 02:13:48,670
我是格鲁特
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}I am Groot.

1715
02:13:48,670 --> 02:13:50,300
噢
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh...

1716
02:13:51,220 --> 02:13:53,300
不 不 不
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}No, no, no!

1717
02:13:54,140 --> 02:13:57,010
格鲁特 不要
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Groot! No.

1718
02:14:10,360 --> 02:14:11,490
山姆
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Sam!

1719
02:14:15,530 --> 02:14:17,240
山姆 你在哪儿
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Sam, where you at?

1720
02:14:26,500 --> 02:14:28,670
情况有些不对
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Something's happening.

1721
02:14:40,810 --> 02:14:42,140
奎尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Quill?

1722
02:14:49,440 --> 02:14:50,690
冷静 奎尔
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Steady, Quill.

1723
02:14:50,690 --> 02:14:52,030
不是吧
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Oh, man.

1724
02:14:56,160 --> 02:14:57,160
托尼
{\3c&H000000&\fs30}Tony.

1725

我们找到了办法逆转离子电荷
and we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge...

88
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,460
争取到了大约48小时的飞行时间
and bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time.

89
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,050
但是现在已经彻底不能用了
But it's now dead in the water.

90
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,470
距最近的便利店有上千光年
Thousand light years from the nearest 7-Eleven.

91
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,220
明天早上氧气将会耗尽
Oxygen will run out tomorrow morning...

92
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,310
然后就完了
and that'll be it.

93
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,170
小派  我知道我说过再不制造意外了
Pep, I know I said no more surprises...

94
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,510
但我得说  我真的希望能完成这最后一个
but I gotta say I was really hoping to pull off one last one.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,230
但是现在看来...
But it looks like...

96
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,570
你知道看起来如何
Well, you know what it looks like.

97
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,160
别为此而难过
Don't feel bad about this.

98
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,660
其实  如果你痛心难过个几周
I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks...

99
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,460
然后带着巨大的罪恶感继续生活下去...
and then move on with enormous guilt...

100
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,190
也许我应该躺会儿
I should probably lie down for a minute.

101
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,460
让眼睛休息一下
Go rest my eyes.

102
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,300
请知道
Please know...

103
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,220
当我渐渐睡去  会和近来的每晚一样
when I drift off, it'll be like every night lately.

104
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,230
我很好  真的很好
I'm fine. Totally fine.

105
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,770
我会梦到你
I dream about you.

106
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,690
因为一直都是你
Because it's always you.

107
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,740
没能阻止他
Couldn't stop him.

108
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,740
我也一样
Neither could I.

109
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,690
等等
Hang on.

110
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,820
我没救下那孩子
I lost the kid.

111
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,990
托尼  我们都输了
Tony, we lost.

112
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,320
派珀她...
Is, uh...?

113
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,200
-太好了  -天呐
- Oh, good. - Oh, my God!

114
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,160
天呐
Oh, my God!

115
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,630
没事了
It's okay.

116
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,260
距灭霸来到地球  已经过了23天
It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth.

117
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,260

{\an9}山姆·威尔逊

121
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,100
世界各国政府分崩离析
World governments are in pieces.

00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,810
{\an7}霍普·凡·戴恩

123
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,230
{\an9}旺达·马克西莫夫

124
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,190
仍在运转的部门
The parts that are still working...

125
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:46,980
{\an7}亨利·皮姆

126
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,980
{\an9}斯科特·朗

127
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,730
在进行人口普查  看来他是成功了
...are trying to take a census and it looks like he did...

128
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,240
{\an8}彼得·帕克

129
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,790
{\an8}苏睿

130
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,290
他做到了他声称要做的事
He did exactly what he said he was gonna do.

131
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,000
{\an8}特查拉

132
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,200
灭霸消灭了...
Thanos wiped out...

133
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,320
{\an8}尼克·弗瑞

134
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,080
一半的生命
...50% of all living creatures.

135
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,460
他现在在哪
Where is he now? Where?

136
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,420
我们不知道
We don't know.

137
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,050
他开了个传送门  穿过去了
He just opened a portal and walked through.

138
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,010
他是哪根筋不对
What's wrong with him?

139
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,090
他很愤怒
Oh, he's pissed.

140
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,470
他觉得自己失败了
He thinks he failed.

141
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,030
没错  他是失败了
Which, of course, he did...

142
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,370
但我们都失败了  不是吗
but you know, there's a lot of that going around, ain't there?

143
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,200
说真的  要不是你开口说话
Honestly, until this exact second

144
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,490
我还以为你是小熊玩偶
I thought you were a Build-A-Bear.

145
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,160
没准我就是
Maybe I am.

146
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,290
我们已经找了灭霸三周
We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now.

147
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,370
扫描外太空
Deep space scans...

148
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,570
卫星搜索  然而毫无发现
and satellites, and we got nothing.

149
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,820
托尼  你和他交手过
Tony, you fought him.

150
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,820
谁跟你说的
Who told you that?

151
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,050
我没跟他"交手"
I didn't fight him.

152
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,090
他用一颗星球暴揍了我
No, he wiped my face with a planet...

153
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,590
然后那个布里克街魔术师把宝石交出去了
while the Bleecker Street magician gave away the store.

154
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,820
实情就是这样  根本谈不上交手
That's what happened. There was no fight,

155
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,010
-好吧  -他根本不可战胜
- Ok.  - 'cause he's not beatable.

156
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,290
他有没有透露过任何线索或坐标
Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?

157
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,480
我几年前就预料到了
I saw this coming a few years back.

158
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,380
我看到了幻象  我本来不想相信
I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it.

159
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,010
以为自己是做梦
Thought I was dreaming.

160
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,110
托尼  我需要你集中精神
Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.

161
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,970
我曾经也需要你
And I needed you.

162
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,450
我是指过去
As in, past tense.

163
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,850
那比你现在的需求重要  太迟了  哥们
That trumps what you need. It's too late, buddy.

164
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,180
抱歉
Sorry.

165
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,850
知道我需要什么吗  我需要刮胡子
You know what I need? I need a shave.

166
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,500
而且我记得我告诉过你们所有人
And I believe I remember telling all youse...

167
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,040
托尼  托尼
Tony, Tony!

168
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,480
还在和不在的  我们需要的
...alive and otherwise, that what we needed

169
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,760
是一套保护世界的战衣
was a suit of armor around the world.

170
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,420
记得吗
Remember that?

171
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,430
不管那是否会影响到我们宝贵的自由
Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not.

172
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,760
那才是我们曾需要的
That's what we needed.

173
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,890
但那并没成功  不是吗
Well, that didn't work out, did it?

174
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,460
我说过我们会输的
I said we'd lose.

175
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,290
而你说  "那就一起输"
You said, "We'll do that together, too."

176
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,540
你猜怎么着  队长
And guess what, Cap?

177
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,090
我们输了
We lost.

178
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,000
而你不在场
And you weren't there.

179
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,150
不过我们就是干这个的  不是吗
But that's what we do, right?

180
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,400
总是在事后行动  我们是"复仇者"
Our best work after the fact? We're the "Avengers."

181
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,320
"复仇者"  而不是"预防者"
We're the "Avengers," Not the "Pre-vengers."

182
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,200
-好了  -对吗
- Okay. - Right?

183
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,910
-你说得很明白了  先坐下吧  -好
- You made your point. Just sit down, okay? - Okay.

184
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,070
-不  我还没说完  -托尼
- No, no, here's my point. You know what? - Tony,

185
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,280
-对了  她可真棒  -你身体不好  坐下
- She's great by the way. - you're sick. Sit down.

186
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,080
我们需要你  你是新生力量
We need you. You're new blood.

187
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,160
一群身心疲惫的老家伙
Bunch of tired old mules.

188
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,460
我没什么可给你的  队长
I got nothing for you, Cap.

189
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,110
没坐标
I got no coordinates...

190
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,770
没线索  没战略  没选择
no clues, no strategies, no options.

191
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,360
屁都没有
Zero. Zip. Nada.

192
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,990
也没有信任  骗子
No trust, liar.

193
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,080
给你  拿着
Here, take this.

194
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,080
你找到他  戴上它
You find him, you put that on...

195
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,960
躲起来
you hide.

196
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,000
-托尼  -我没事
- Tony! - I'm fine.

197
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,460
让我...
Let me...

198
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,110
布鲁斯给他注射了镇静剂
Bruce gave him a sedative.

199
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,600
估计他今天之内都不会醒了
He's gonna probably be out for the rest of the day.

200
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,450
你们照顾好他
You guys take care of him...

201
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,520
我回来时给他捎点克佐利亚的神药
and I'll bring him a Xorrian elixir when I come back.

202
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,160
你要去哪
Where are you going?

203
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,770
去杀灭霸
To kill Thanos.

204
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,380
我们通常一起行动
You know, we usually work as a team here and, uh,

205
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,340
私下里说一句  现在士气有点低落
between you and I, morale's a little fragile.

206
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,420
我们知道太空是你的领域
We realize up there is more your territory,

207
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,990
但这也是我们的战斗
but this is our fight, too.

208
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,090
你知道他在哪吗
You even know where he is?

209
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,380
我认识可能知道的人
I know people who might.

210
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,500
不必麻烦了
Don't bother.

211
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,830
我可以告诉你灭霸在哪
I can tell you where Thanos is.

212
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,880
灭霸花了很长时间来完善我
Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me.

213
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,420
他改造我时  总爱说他的伟大计划
And when he worked, he talked about his Great Plan.

214
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,550
就算被拆解了  我仍然想讨好他
Even disassembled, I wanted to please him.

215
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,390
我会问
I'd ask...

216
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,520
等计划完成后  我们去哪
where would we go once his plan was complete?

217
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,100
他每次的回答都一样
And his answer was always the same.

218
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,730
"去花园"
"To the Garden."

219
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,920
真有爱  灭霸还有退休计划
That's cute. Thanos has a retirement plan.

220
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,070
那他在哪
So, where is he?

221
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,760
灭霸打响指时
When Thanos snapped his fingers...

222
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,170
地球成了宇宙级能量涌的
Earth became ground zero for a power surge

223
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,220
爆发点
of ridiculously cosmic proportions.

224
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,160
可谓前无古人
No one's ever seen anything like it.

225
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,410
直到两天前...
Until two days ago...

226
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,130
这个星球上又发生了一次
on this planet.

227
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,460
灭霸在那儿
Thanos is there.

228
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,050
他又用了一次宝石
He used the stones again.

229
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,280
我们去的话  人手不足
We'd be going in shorthanded, you know?

230
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,740
宝石还在他手里  所以...
Look, he's still got the stones, so...

231
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,810
那我们就去夺回来
So, let's get 'em.

232
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,030
用宝石把大家救回来
Use them to bring everyone back.

233
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,120
就这样
Just like that?

234
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,030
对  就这样
Yeah. Just like that.

235
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,410
哪怕有一丝挽回一切的希望
Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this...

236
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,000
我们也必须为不在这里的每个人一试
I mean, we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try.

237
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,710
就算我们去  我们怎么知道
If we do this, how do we know

238
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,250
结局会跟上次不一样
it's gonna end any differently than it did before?

239
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,160
因为上次你们没有我
Because before you didn't have me.

因为如果不成功  我不知道该怎么办
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

之后  宝石就没有用了
After that, the stones served no purpose...

268
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,830
只是诱惑
beyond temptation.

269

你杀了数万亿生灵
You murdered trillions!

270

What?

286
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,170
你干了什么
What did you do?

287
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,720
我砍脑袋了

294
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,300
都不知道该谈些什么
I didn't even know what to talk about.

295
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,220
你们谈了什么
What did you talk about?

296
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,720
还是老一套  时过境迁了
Same old crap. You know, how things have changed.

297

And then things got quiet...

300
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,490
侍者上沙拉时  他哭了
then he cried as they were serving the salads.

301
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,110
那你呢
What about you?

302
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,660

你已经完成了最难的部分  你鼓起勇气行动了
You did the hardest part. You took the jump.

306
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,000

我们得这样勇敢地迈出一个个小步

00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,160
显然  你的朋友很好
Clearly, your friend is fine.

401
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,260
我过桥的时候
You know, I saw a pod of whales

402
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,510
看到了一群鲸鱼
when I was coming over the bridge.

403
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,510
在哈德逊河里吗
In the Hudson?

404
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,640
船只少了  水就清了
There's fewer ships... cleaner water.

405
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,750
如果你要跟我说
You know, if you're about to tell me

406
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,710
去看好的一面
to look on the bright side...

407
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,050
我就用花生酱三明治砸你的头
I'm about to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich.

408
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,890
抱歉
Sorry.

409
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,310
旧习难改
Force of habit.

410
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,800
我一直告诉大家要放下过去
You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on...

411
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,030
继续生活
and grow.

412
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:31,950
有些人这么做了
Some do.

413
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,790
但是我们不行
But not us.

414
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,790
如果我放下过去  谁来做这些事
If I move on, who does this?

415
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,050
也许这些事不需要做
Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

416
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,300
以前我一无所有
I used to have nothing.

417
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,640
然后我拥有了这些
And then I got this.

418
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,390
这份工作
This job.

419
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,650
这个家庭
This family.

420
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,190
我因此
And I was

421
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,660
变得更好
I was better because of it.

422
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:17,790
虽然他们都不在了
And even though they're gone...

423
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,500
我还是在尽量变得更好
I'm still trying to be better.

424
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,220
我觉得我们俩都需要有点私生活
I think we both need to get a life.

425
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,180
你先来
You first.

426
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,200
有人在吗
Is anyone home?

427
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,110
我是斯科特·朗
This is, uh, Scott Lang.

428
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,360
我们几年前在机场见过
We met a few years ago at the airport...

429
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,530
德国的机场
in Germany?

430
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,510
我是那个变大的人  我当时戴了面具
I was the guy that got really big. I had a mask on.

431
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,170
-你们大概认不出我  -这是以前的信息吗
- You wouldn't recognize me. - Is this an old message?

432
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,470
蚁人  我知道你们知道我
Ant-Man? I know you know... I know you know that.

433
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,210
-那是前门  -我真的需要和你们谈谈
- It's the front gate.  - I really need to talk to you guys.

434
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,130
斯科特
Scott.

435
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,360
你没事吧
Are you okay?

436
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,260
我没事
Yeah.

437
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,550
你们俩学过量子物理学吗
Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics?

438
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,680
只有一点点了解
Only to make conversation.

439
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,810
好吧  是这样...
All right, so...

440
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,520
五年前  就在...
five years ago, right before...

441
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,310
灭霸的事发生前...
Thanos...

442
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,610
我进入了一个叫量子域的地方
I was in a place called the quantum realm.

443
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,550
量子域有它自己的微观宇宙
The quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe.

444
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,700
要想进去  你得变得非常非常小
To get in there, you have to be incredibly small.

445
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,200
霍普  她是我的...
Hope. She's my, um...

446
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,740
她本是我的...
She was my...

447
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,930
她本应该把我拉出来的
She was supposed to pull me out.

448
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,640
然后灭霸的事发生了...
And then Thanos happened...

449
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,750
我就被困在里面了
and I got stuck in there.

450
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,770
很遗憾  这五年一定很漫长
I'm sorry, that must have been a very long five years.

451
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,040
是啊  问题就在这里
Yeah, but that's just it.

452
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,630
并不漫长
It wasn't.

453
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,310
对我来说  只有五个小时
For me, it was five hours.

454
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,690
量子域的法则
See, the rules of the quantum realm

455
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:50,900
跟这个世界不一样
aren't like they are up here.

456
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,570
一切都不可预测
Everything is unpredictable.

457
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,940
那个三明治有人要吗
Is that anybody's sandwich?

458
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,220
我饿死了
I'm starving.

459
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,680
斯科特
Scott.

460
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,430
你说的是什么意思
What are you talking about?

461
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,060
所以...
So...

462
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,940
我想说的是...
what I'm saying is...

463
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,440
在量子域里  时间有不同的运行方式
time works differently in the quantum realm.

464
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,030
唯一的问题是  现在
The only problem is right now

465
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,090
我们没法在其中定位
we don't have a way to navigate it.

466
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,240
但如果有办法呢
But what if we did?

467
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,630
我一直在思考这个
I can't stop thinking about it.

468
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,130
如果我们能想办法控制这种混沌
What if we could somehow control the chaos...

469
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,130
并在其中定位呢
and we could navigate it?

470
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,880
如果我们有办法
What if there was a way...

471
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,550
在某个特定时间点
that we could enter the quantum realm

472
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,800
进入量子域
at a certain point in time...

473
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,310
然后在另一个特定时间点
but then exit the quantum realm

474
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,890
离开量子域呢
at another point in time?

475
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:24,750
比如说
Like...

476
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,960
-在灭霸打响指之前  -等等
- Like before Thanos. - Wait.

477
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,840
你指的是时间机器吗
Are you talking about a time machine?

478
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,770
不  不  当然不是  不是时间机器
No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine.

479
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,090
这更像是...
This is more like a...

480
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,700
没错  就是时间机器
Yeah. Like a time machine.

481
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,720
我知道  这很疯狂  非常疯狂
I know, it's crazy. It's crazy.

482
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,780
但我就一直在思考这个
But I can't stop thinking about it.

483
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,060
肯定有...
There's gotta be...

484
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,270
办法的...
some way...

485
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,080
-是很疯狂  -斯科特
- It's crazy. - Scott.

486
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,790
我能收到一只浣熊发的邮件
I get emails from a raccoon...

487
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,150
所以  再没什么算是"疯狂"了
so nothing sounds crazy anymore.

488
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,700
那么  我们要跟谁讨论这个
So, who do we talk to about this?

489
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:12,800
开饭咯
Chow time!

490
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,550
摩古娜
Maguna.

491
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,600
摩根·H·斯塔克  你想吃午饭吗
Morgan H. Stark, you want some lunch?

492
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,870
定义一下"午饭"  不然
Define "lunch" or be

493
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,230
-就等着被灭吧  -好吧
- disintegrated. - Okay.

494
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,330
你不应该戴这个  好吗
You should not be wearing that, okay?

495
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,080
这是我给妈妈做的周年纪念
That is part of a special anniversary gift

496
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,360
特别礼物里的
I'm making for Mom.

497
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,240
好了  想吃午饭吗
There you go. You thinking about lunch?

498
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,720
我可以拿莴苣包一把蟋蟀给你
I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.

499
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,540
-不  -你不是想吃那个吗
- No. - That's what you want.

500
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,050
你怎么找到这个的
How did you find this?

501
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,810
-在车库里  -真的吗
- Garage. - Really?

502
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,040
-你是有意去找它的吗  -没有
- Were you looking for it? - No.

503
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,340
反正我找到了
I found it, though.

504
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,520
你喜欢进车库是吗
You like going in the garage, huh?

505
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,170
爸爸也是
So does Daddy.

506
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,760
其实没关系  我给妈妈买的礼物她从来不穿
It's fine, actually. Mom never wears anything I buy her.

507
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,430
那么  我要...
So, I'm gonna...

508
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,670
不  我们知道这听上去多疯狂
No. We know what it sounds like.

509
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,010
托尼  在经历过这一切之后
Tony, after everything you've seen,

510
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,890
-难道还真有不可能的事吗  -量子波动
- is anything really impossible? - Quantum fluctuation

511
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,220
达到普朗克尺度
messes with the Planck scale...

512
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,930
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}大卫·德将量子理论与多重宇宙理论结合
提出回到过去只是进入另一个平行宇宙

513
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,930
并引出德氏观点
which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition.

514
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:29,250
我们能认同这一点吗
Can we agree on that?

515
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,350
谢谢
Thank you.

516
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:33,040
通俗地讲  就是你无法回到这里了
In layman's terms, it means you're not coming home.

517
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,150
-我回来了  -不对
- I did. - No.

518
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,710
你是碰巧幸存了
You accidentally survived.

519
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,300
这是十亿分之一的宇宙侥幸
It's a billion-to-one cosmic fluke.

520
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,050
现在你想进行...
And now you wanna pull a...

521
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,930
你怎么说的来着
What do you call it?

522
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,120
时间盗窃
A time heist?

523
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,530
没错  时间盗窃  当然了
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.

524
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,980
我们之前怎么没想到呢
Why didn't we think of this before?

525
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,580
因为这太好笑了  简直是白日梦
Because it's laughable. Because it's a pipe dream.

526
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,320
无限宝石都在过去
The stones are in the past.

527
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,040
我们可以回去拿到它们
We could go back, we could get them.

528
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,380
我们可以自己打响指  把所有人带回来
We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everybody back.

529
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,630
或者让事情变得更糟  对吗
Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?

530
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,170
我觉得我们不会的
I don't believe we would.

531
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,330
不得不说  有时我还挺怀念你的乐观
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss that giddy optimism.

532
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,260
然而  如果没有合理可行的方法
However, high hopes won't help

533
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,390
来安全地进行所谓的时间盗窃
if there's no logical, tangible way

534
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:12,350
寄予厚望也没用
for me to safely execute said time heist.

535
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,020
我认为最可能的后果
I believe the most likely outcome

536
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,060
就是我们共同灭亡
will be our collective demise.

537
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,090
只要我们严格遵守时间旅行的规则就不会
Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel.

538
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:21,030
就是说  不可以跟过去的自己交谈
All right? It means no talking to our past selves...

539
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,400
不可以给体育比赛下注
no betting on sporting events.

540
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,810
我得让你打住了  斯科特
I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott.

541
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,870
你真要跟我说
Are you seriously telling me

542
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,450
你拯救宇宙的计划
that your plan to save the universe...

543
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,600
是基于《回到未来》的吗
is based on Back to the Future?

544
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,480
-是吗  -不是
- Is it? - No.

545
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,580
很好  你刚刚害我有点担忧
Good. You had me worried there.

546
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,730
因为那就扯淡了
'Cause that would be horseshit.

547
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,210
量子物理的原理不是那样的
That's not how quantum physics works.

548
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,110
托尼
Tony.

549
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,120
我们必须奋起抗争
We have to take a stand.

550
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,030
我们抗争了  但还是落得这个地步
We did stand. And yet, here we are.

551
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,600
我知道你有很多顾虑
I know you got a lot on the line.

552
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,540
你有妻子  女儿
You got a wife, a daughter.

553
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,380
但我也失去了对我非常重要的人
But I lost someone very important to me.

554
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,460
很多人都是
A lotta people did.

555
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,690
而现在  我们有机会让她回来
And now, now we have a chance to bring her back...

556
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,070
让所有人回来

557
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,400
而你却告诉我  你甚至都不...
and you're telling me that you won't even...

558
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,510
是的  斯科特  我甚至都不
That's right, Scott. I won't even.

559
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,390
我做不到
I can't.

560
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,890
妈妈让我来救你
Mommy told me to come and save you.

561
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,610
干得好  你救下我了
Good job. I'm saved.

562
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,420
我真希望你们是来问我其他事的
I wish you were coming here to ask me something else.

563
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,610
什么都行
Anything else.

00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,420
我真的很高兴见到你们  我只是...
I'm honestly happy to see you guys, I just...

565
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,710
对了  我们准备了六人份的午餐
Oh, look, the table's set for six.

566
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,530
托尼  我懂
Tony. I get it.

567
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,820
我为你高兴  真的
And I'm happy for you. I really am.

568
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,620
但这是我们的第二次机会
But this is a second chance.

569
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,080
我的第二次机会就在这儿呢  队长
I got my second chance right here, Cap.

570
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,830
我不能拿她冒险
Can't roll the dice on it.

571
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,250
只要不谈工作  你们可以留下来用午餐
If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch.

572
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,590
他害怕了
Well, he's scared.

573
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,180
他没有错
He's not wrong.

574
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,400
是啊  但是  我们该怎么办
Yeah, but, I mean, what are we, what are we, what are we gonna do?

575
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,140
我们需要他  我们就这么放弃吗
We need him. What, are we gonna stop?

576
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,510
不  我想把这事做好
No, I wanna do it right.

577
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,730
我们需要一个大大脑
We're gonna need a really big brain.

578
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,690
比他的还大吗
Bigger than his?

579
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,290
别这样  怎么好像就我一个人在吃
Come on, I feel like I'm the only one eating here.

580
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,360
尝尝那个
Try some of that.

581
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,820
来点炒蛋
Have some eggs.

582
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,380
我好困惑
I'm so confused.

583
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,910
现在就是令人困惑的年代
These are confusing times.

584
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,090
是啊  不  不  我不是那个意思
Right, no, no. That's not what I meant.

585
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:10,200
我懂啦  我开玩笑的
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

586
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,120
我知道  这很疯狂
I know, it's crazy.

587
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,720
我都开始穿衬衫了
I'm wearing shirts now.

588
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,960
是啊  什么  怎么会  为什么
Yeah. What? How? Why?

589
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,460
五年前  我们惨败
Five years ago, we got our asses beat.

590
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,520
只不过我更惨
Except it was worse for me...

591
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,020
因为我输了两次
'cause I lost twice.

592
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,340
先是绿巨人输了  后来班纳又输了
First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost...

593
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,190
再后来  我们都输了
and then, we all lost.

594
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,740
没人怪你  布鲁斯
No one blamed you, Bruce.

595
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,640
我怪
I did.

596
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,120
这么多年来  我一直把绿巨人
For years, I've been treating the Hulk

597
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,450
当成一种疾病
like he's some kind of disease...

598
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,640
一种需要摆脱的东西
something to get rid of.

599
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,400
但后来  我开始视他为出路
But then, I start looking at him as the cure.

600
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,040
我在伽马实验室待了18个月
Eighteen months in the gamma lab.

601
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,740
把思想和力量融为了一体
I put the brains and the brawn together...

602
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,490
现在看看我
and now, look at me.

603
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,990
两个自我的最佳状态
Best of both worlds.

604
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,840
-打扰一下  绿巨人先生  -什么事
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk? - Yes.

605
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,330
我们能跟你合影吗
Can we get a photo?

606
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,550
当然可以  小朋友
100%, little person.

607
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,790
来  站过来  能帮个忙吗

608
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,830
-当然  -谢谢
- Oh, yeah, yeah. - Thanks.

609
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,540
说"绿"
Say "Green."

610
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,560
-绿  -绿
- Green. - Green.

611
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,480
拍到了吗
Did you get that?

612
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,590
拍得很好
That's a good one.

613
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,140
你们也想跟我合个影吗  我是蚁人
Did you want to grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man.

614
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,110
他们是绿巨人的粉丝
They're Hulk fans.

615
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,280
-他们不知道蚁人  -等等  不  不
- They don't know Ant-Man. - Wait. No, no.

616
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,580
-他难过了  -没人知道
- He feel bad. - Nobody...nobody does.

617
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,780
-他想跟你们...  -我不想合影
- No, he wants you...  - I don't want a picture.

618
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,330
-他想跟你们合影  -陌生人很危险
- He wants you to take a picture with him. - Stranger danger.

619
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,200
你看  他都说不要了
Yeah, look, he's even saying no, he doesn't.

620
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,580
-我懂  我也不想  -别这样  那孩子
- I get it. I don't want it, either. - But come on, the kid, but...

621
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,880
-我不想跟他们合影  -可你...
- I don't want a picture with them. - But you...

622
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,080
-他会难过的  -抱歉
- He's gonna feel bad. - Sorry.

623
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,210
他们乐意的  他们说愿意了
They're happy to do it. They said they'll do it.

624
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,500
-我不想合影  -我们可以拍的
- I don't want to do it. - We can do it.

时间旅行重来一次的事

各位  这不是我专长的领域
Guys, it's outside of my area of expertise.

638
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,390
这事你都搞定了
Well, you pulled this off.

639
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,980
我记得这曾经也看似不可能
I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible, too.

640
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,410
我有个小灵感
I've got a mild inspiration.

641
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:37,720
我想看看行不行得通
I'd like to see if it checks out.

642
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,080
所以  今晚收工前
So, I'd like to run one last sim

643
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,810
我想再做一次模拟

644
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:45,000
这一次  以莫比乌斯环的形态

进行光谱分解
factoring in spectral decomp.

649

不成功也没事  我只是...

-该死  -不  我们不能说那种话

00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,090
因为我还有大事要做
'Cause I've got some important shit going on here!

661

00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,290
是的
Sure was.

666
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,680
这是敲诈  敲诈是个词
That's extortion. That's a word.

667
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,670
你想要什么味的
What kind you want?

快睡觉  不然我把你玩具全卖了
Go to bed or I'll sell all your toys.

684
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,300
晚安

对  我也不可能帮助所有人
Nope. And I can't help everybody.

706
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,170
看来你可以
Sorta seems like you can.

707
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,160
除非我停手
Not if I stop.

708
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:47,620
我可以马上收手不干
I can put a pin in it right now and stop.

709
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,290
托尼
Tony...

710
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,880
劝你收手
trying to get you to stop...

711
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,750
是我这辈子少数做不到的事之一
has been one of the few failures of my entire life.

712
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,800
我有几分觉得  我该把它
Something tells me I should put it in a

713
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,220
锁进盒子里  沉进湖底
lockbox and drop it to the bottom of the lake...

714
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,850
然后上床睡觉
and go to bed.

715
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,320
但你能安心睡着吗
But would you be able to rest?

716
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,990
好  准备好  时间旅行测试1
Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one.

717

斯科特  启动
Scott, fire up...the, uh,

718
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,040
车里那玩意
van thing.

断路器已安装好
Breakers are set.

720
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,390
紧急发电机已就绪
Emergency generators are on standby.

721
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:34,890
很好  因为如果我们烧断了电网
Good, because if we blow the grid,

722
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,520
我可不想把小不点丢在上世纪五十年代
I don't want to lose, uh, Tiny here in the 1950s.

723
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,260
-你说什么  -他在开玩笑呢
- Excuse me? - He's kidding.

724
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,860
你不能说这种话
You can't say things like that.

725
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,470
就是个冷笑话而已
It was a bad joke.

726
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,370
你是在开玩笑  对吧
You were kidding, right?

727
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:51,540
我不知道  这可是时间旅行
I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here.

728
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,860
要么就是玩笑  要么就是玩完
Either it's all a joke, or none of it is.

729
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:55,190
我们准备好了
We're good!

730
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:57,150
戴上你的头盔
Get your helmet on.

731
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:59,880
斯科特  我要把你送回一周之前
Scott, I'm gonna send you back a week...

732
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,420
让你待一个小时
let you walk around for an hour,

733
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,450
然后10秒后带你回来
then bring you back in 10 seconds.

734
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,660
懂吗
Make sense?

735
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,300
完全明白
Perfectly not confusing.

736
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,620
祝你好运  斯科特  你能行的
Good luck, Scott. You got this.

737
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:10,790
你说得对
You're right.

738
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,210
我能行的  美国队长
I do, Captain America.

739
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,310
三秒倒计时
On a count of three...

740
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:20,550
三  二  一
Three, two, one.

741
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,720
各位
Guys?

742
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,160
这感觉不对劲
This doesn't feel right.

743
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,740
怎么回事
What is this?

744
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,820
-这是怎么了  -那是谁
- What's going on? - Who is that?

745
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:30,660
-等等  -那是斯科特吗
- Hold on. - Is that Scott?

746
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,940
当然是了
Yes, it's Scott.

747
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:37,080
-怎么回事  布鲁斯  -我的背
- What's going on, Bruce? - Oh, my back!

748
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,290
-这又怎么回事  -等等的
- What is this? - Hold on a second.

749
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:39,540
-能让让吗  -当然
- Could I get a little space here? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

750
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,630
你能把他变回来吗
Can you bring him back?

751
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:41,780
我在努力呢
I'm working on it.

752
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:49,720
是个婴儿
It's a baby.

753
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,550
-是斯科特  -婴儿的斯科特
- It's Scott. - As a baby.

754
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,140
-他会长大的  -把斯科特变回来
- He'll grow. - Bring Scott back.

755
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,810
我说断电时  就断电
When I say kill the power, kill the power.

756
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:55,790
天呐
Oh, my God.

757
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,420
准备...断电
And... kill it!

758
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,340
有人尿在我裤子里了
Somebody peed my pants.

759
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,480
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

760
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:08,890
但我不确定是婴儿的我  还是老年的我
But I don't know if it was baby me or old me.

761
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,330
还是就是我
Or just me me.

762
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:15,810
时间旅行啊
Time travel!

763
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,400
怎么了
What?

764
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,490
我觉得这绝对是成功啊
I see this as an absolute win.

765
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,280
干吗拉个脸
Why the long face?

766
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,200
我猜猜  他变成婴儿了
Let me guess, he turned into a baby.

767
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,510
还不止  对  你怎么来了
Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?

768
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,370
是爱波罗悖论
It's the EPR Paradox.

769
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,060
你们没能让朗在时间里移动
Instead of pushing Lang through time,

770
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,390
而是让时间在朗身上流动了
you might've wound up pushing time through Lang.

771
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,270
这很不好弄  很危险
It's tricky, dangerous.

772
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:25,260
真该有人提醒你注意的
Somebody could have cautioned you against it.

773
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,380
你提醒了
You did.

774
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:27,800
是吗
Oh, did I?

775
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,970
幸好我来了
Well, thank God I'm here.

776
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,350
不管怎样  我解决了
Regardless, I fixed it.

777
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:35,600
完全好用的时间空间定位仪
A fully functioning time-space GPS.

778
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:38,850
我只想要和平
I just want peace.

779
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:43,230
原来怨恨会腐蚀心灵  我讨厌它
Turns out resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.

780
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,860
我也是
Me, too.

781
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:47,880
我们有机会拿到宝石
We got a shot at getting these stones,

782
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,070
但我得告诉你我最看重什么
but I gotta tell you my priorities.

783
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:52,620
找回我们失去的  希望可以
Bring back what we lost, I hope, yes.

784
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,540
留住我得到的  我必须  不惜一切
Keep what I found, I have to, at all costs.

785
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:59,330
或许  不用杀身成仁
And maybe not die trying.

786
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,750
那样最好了
Would be nice.

787
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,300
听上去不错
Sounds like a deal.

788
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:28,920
托尼  这好吗
Tony, I don't know.

789
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,820
怎么了
Why?

790
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:31,740
这是他为你造的
He made it for you.

791
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,590
而且  说实在的  我得赶紧从车库里取出来
Plus, honestly, I have to get it out of the garage

792
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,490
不然要被摩根拿去滑着玩了
before Morgan takes it sledding.

793
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:42,960
谢谢  托尼
Thank you, Tony.

794
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:45,500
你能别声张吗
Will you keep that a little quiet?

795
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,880
我可没给全队都带礼物来
Didn't bring one for the whole team.

796
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,550
是全队都来吧
We are getting the whole team, yeah?

797
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:54,600
我们正在集结人手呢
We're working on that right now.

798
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:13,990
人类
Hey, Humie.

799
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,870
大绿呢
Where's Big Green?

800
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,450
在厨房里吧
The kitchen, I think.

801
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,790
好赞啊
That's awesome.

802
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,330
罗德  降落时小心
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.

803
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:26,290
降落区有个白痴
There's an idiot in the landing zone.

804
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,500
天呐
Oh, God.

805
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,920
好啊  普通大小的哥们
What's up, Regular-Sized Man?

806
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:06,460
{\an8}欢迎来到新阿斯加德  请慢速行驶

807
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:23,990
跟金宫殿  魔法锤比
Kind of a step down from the golden palaces

808
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:26,160
差远了啊
and the magic hammers and whatnot.

809
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,790
有点同情心嘛  伙计
Hey, have a little compassion, pal.

810
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:30,000
他们先失去了阿斯加德  然后又失去了半数人民
First, they lost Asgard, then half their people.

811
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,630
他们大概有个家就很开心了
They're probably just happy to have a home.

812
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:33,280
你们不该来的
You shouldn't have come.

813
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,590

见到你真高兴  生气姑娘
Great to see you, angry girl!

815
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:42,410
我觉得你另外两个形态哪个都比这样好
I think I liked you better either of the other ways.

816
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:43,800
这是火箭
This is Rocket.

817
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:44,660
你好
How ya doing?

818
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:48,500
他不会见你们的
He won't see you.

819
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,850
那么糟吗
It's that bad, huh?

820
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,150
我们每月只能见到他一次
We only see him once a month

821
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:54,880
在他来取"补给"时
when he comes in for "supplies."

822
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,260
{\an8}啤酒

823
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,400
那么糟啊
It's that bad.

824
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,300
是啊
Yeah.

825
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:11,480
搞什么
What the...?

826
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:16,570
这里面一股腐臭
Something died in here!

827
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,740
有人吗  托尔
Hello? Thor!

828
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,030
你是来修电视的吗
Are you here about the cable?

829
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:24,950
电影频道两周前就收不到了
The Cinemax went out two weeks ago and...

830
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,170
体育频道也都模模糊糊的
the sports are all kinda fuzzy and whatnot.

831
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:29,710
托尔
Thor?

832
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:40,600

835
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,020
别了  别介了
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.

836
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,830
真没必要
That's not necessary.

837
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,580
绿巨人  你认识我的朋友米克和寇格吧
Hulk, you know my friends Miek and Korg, right?

838
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,040

Thor, he's back.

844
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,700
电视上那小子刚刚又喊我蠢货了
That kid on the TV just called me a dickhead again.

845
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,040
新手大师

00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,930
对  新手大师69
Yeah, NoobMaster69

847
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:11,630
-喊我蠢货  -我受够了
- called me a dickhead. - I am sick of this.

848
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:14,140
新手大师  还是托尔
Noobmaster, hey, it's Thor again.

849
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:15,520
雷神哦
You know, the God of Thunder.

我就飞去你家
I am gonna fly over to your house,

852
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,280
冲进你正躲在的地下室里
come down to that basement you're hiding in,

853
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,970
扯掉你的胳膊  塞进你屁眼里
rip off your arms, and shove them up your butt!

854
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,070
没错
Oh, that's right, yes!

855
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:27,390
去你爸那儿哭吧  小混蛋
Go cry to your father, you little weasel.

856
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:28,740
谢谢  托尔
Thank you, Thor.

857
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,410
他再敢欺负你就告诉我  好吗
Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?

858
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:32,100
非常感谢  我会的

859
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,120
你们想喝点啥吗  我们喝什么

伙计
Buddy.

862
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,620
-你没事吧  -嗯  我没事  怎么了
- You all right? - Yes, I'm fine. Why?

863
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,220
我看上去不好吗
Why, don't I look all right?

864
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,830
你看上去像融化的冰淇淋
You look like melted ice cream.

865
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,920
怎么  你就是来玩的吗
So, what's up? You just here for a hang, or what?

866
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,250
我们需要你帮忙
We need your help.

867
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,560
我们或许有机会修复一切
There might be a chance we could fix everything.

868
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,000
电视吗
What, like the cable?

869
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:59,400
因为这事折磨我几周了
'Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks.

870
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,630
是灭霸
Like Thanos.

871
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:22,740
别提那个名字
Don't say that name.

872
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:26,370
是啊  我们这里不提那个名字的
Yeah, we don't actually say that name in here.

873
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,210
请把你的手拿开
Please take your hand off me.

874
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:39,630
我知道那...家伙
Now, I know that guy...

875
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,630
可能让你害怕
might scare you.

876
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:42,930
怎么会呢
Why would I be...?

877
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,180
我怎么会怕那家伙
Why would I be scared of that guy?

878
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,760
是我杀了那家伙  记得吗
I'm the one who killed that guy, remember?

879
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,560
这里有别人杀他了吗
Anyone else here kill that guy?

880
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:55,940
没有
Nope.

881
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:58,150
我猜也是
Didn't think so.

882
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,740
寇格  你跟大家说说
Korg, why don't you, uh, tell everybody

883
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,200
是谁砍掉了灭霸的大脑袋
who chopped Thanos' big head off?

884
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,460
风暴斧吗
Stormbreaker?

885
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,570
那是谁挥的风暴斧
Who was swinging Stormbreaker?

886
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:12,850
我懂的  你心里很难过
I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay?

887
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,060
我也经历过
I've been there myself.

888
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,880
知道是谁帮我走出来的吗
And you want to know who helped me out of it?

889
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:18,880
是娜塔莎吗
Was it Natasha?

890
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:20,590
是你
It was you.

891
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,720
是你帮了我
You helped me.

892
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,390
那你怎么不去问问
So, why don't you ask...

893
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:29,220
下面的阿斯加德人
the Asgardians down there...

894
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,310
我的帮助有多少价值
how much my help is worth?

895
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:38,770
至少是还剩下的那些
The ones that are left, anyway.

896
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,610
我觉得我们能把他们找回来
I think we could bring them back.

897
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,320
住口
Stop.

898
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:44,700
别说了  好吗
Stop, okay?

899
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,420
我知道你觉得我是待在这里
I know you think I'm down here

900
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,380
沉湎于自怨自艾之中
wallowing in my own self-pity...

901
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:51,010
等着有人来拯救
waiting to be rescued and saved...

902
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:53,390
但我没事  好吗  我们都没事  是吧
but I'm fine, okay. We're fine, aren't we?

903
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:54,390
我们很好  伙计
Oh, we're good here, mate.

904
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:57,060
所以  不管你有什么提议  我们不感兴趣
So, whatever it is that you're offering, we're not into it.

905
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,790
不在乎  完全不在乎
Don't care. Couldn't care less.

906
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:59,840
再见
Goodbye.

907
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:04,550
我们需要你  伙计
We need you, pal.

908
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:15,940
船上有啤酒
There's beer on the ship.

909
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,610
哪种的
What kind?

910
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,570
{\an8}{\pos(306.8,90.667)}东京

911
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,290
{\pos(161.6,221.6)}是他  他来杀昭彦了

912
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:06,030
你为什么要这么做

913
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,360
我们跟你无冤无仇

914
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,990
{\pos(277.6,205.6)}你们还活着

915
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,160
{\pos(284.4,205.6)}半个地球的人却死了

916
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,040
{\pos(266.4,204.533)}他们因灭霸而死

917
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,580
{\pos(271.6,202.4)}你会死在我手里

918
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:23,960
{\pos(95.6,233.866)}你再别想伤害谁了

919
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,300
{\pos(267.6,148.533)}我们伤害人

920
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:31,510
{\pos(196.4,230.667)}你真是疯了

921
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:02,830
{\pos(205.6,225.333)}等等  救我

922
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:05,960
{\pos(244.4,209.867)}你想要什么我都给你

923
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,210
{\pos(198,214.133)}你想要什么

924
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,380
我想要的
What I want

925
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:11,840
你给不了
you can't give me.

926
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:36,740
你不该来的
You shouldn't be here.

927
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,410
你也不该
Neither should you.

928
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:48,590
我有工作要做
I've got a job to do.

929
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:51,720
你管这叫工作吗
Is that what you're calling this?

930
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:55,220
杀这些人也不能让你的家人回来
Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back.

931
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,390
我们有发现
We found something.

932
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:05,860
或许是一线希望
A chance, maybe.

933
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,190
别
Don't.

934
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,490
别什么
Don't what?

935
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,070
别给我希望
Don't give me hope.

936
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:22,870
很抱歉我没能早点给你
I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.

937
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:46,060
你左偏了
You're drifting left.

938
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,310
小心点  督爷
One side there, Lebowski.

939
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:52,860
火贱  干得怎么样了
Ratchet, how's it going?

940
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,000
是火箭
It's Rocket.

941
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,160
你放尊敬点  你只在地球上是天才  伙计
Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal.

942
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:03,450
时间旅行服  不赖啊
Time travel suit, not bad.

943
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,260
小心点
Easy! Easy!

944
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:07,390
我很小心了
I'm being very careful.

945
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:09,020
不  你很绿巨人
No, you're being very Hulky.

946
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:09,810
我很小心了
I'm being careful.

947
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:11,480
这可是皮姆粒子
These are Pym Particles, all right?

948
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,690
因为汉克·皮姆已被响指打消失了
And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence,

949
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,310
我们只剩这些了
this is it.

950
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,400
我们只有这么多  我们再造不出更多了
This is what we have. We're not making any more.

951
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,430
-斯科特  冷静  -抱歉
- Scott, calm down. - Sorry.

952
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:21,530
我们只够每人往返一次  再就没了
We've got enough for one round-trip each. That's it.

953
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:22,530
不能重来
No do-overs.

954
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:24,770
还能做两次测试
Plus two test runs.

955
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:30,480
一次测试
One test run.

956
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:33,210
好吧  我没准备好呢
All right. I'm not ready for this.

957
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:34,030
我愿意
I'm game.

958
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:37,570
我去吧
I'll do it.

959
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,290
克林特  你会因时移
Clint, now you're gonna feel a little

960
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:41,930
而感到有些混乱
discombobulated from the chronoshift.

961
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:42,590
不用担心的
Don't worry about that.

962
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,220
等等  我问你件事
Wait, wait, wait a second. Let me ask you something.

963
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,620
如果我们能做到
If we can do this, you know...

964
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:48,390
回到过去  何不去找到婴儿灭霸
go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos?

965
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:49,210
然后...
You know, and...

966
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,060
首先  这太黑暗了
First of all, that's horrible.

967
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:55,770
那是灭霸啊
It's Thanos.

968
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:58,110
其次  时间不是那样的
And secondly, time doesn't work that way.

969
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:00,530
改变过去不能改变未来
Changing the past doesn't change the future.

970
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:02,030
我们回到过去  赶在灭霸之前
Look, we go back, we get the stones

971
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:03,410
拿到宝石
before Thanos gets them...

972
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:06,120
灭霸就拿不到宝石了  问题解决
Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved.

973
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,120
-是啊  -原理不是这样的
- Bingo. - That's not how it works.

974
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,160
我听说是这样的
Well, that's what I heard.

975
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,500
谁  谁说的
Wait, but who? Who told you that?

976
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,710
《星际迷航》《终结者》《时间警察》
Star Trek, Terminator, Timecop...

977
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:14,210
-《两世奇人》  -《量子跳跃》
- Time After Time. - Quantum Leap.

978
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:15,460
《时间的皱折》《时光倒流七十年》
Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time.

979
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,290
《热浴盆时光机》
Hot Tub Time Machine.

980
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:17,590
《热浴盆时光机》
Hot Tub Time Machine.

981
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:19,000
《比尔和泰德历险记》
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.

982
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:21,590
基本上所有讲时间旅行的电影都是这样的
Basically, any movie that deals with time travel.

983
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:23,340
《虎胆龙威》  不对  那个不是
Die Hard. No, that's not one.

984
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:24,380
这是已知定律
This is known.

985
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:25,890
我不知道为什么大家都相信那个
I don't know why everyone believes that,

986
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:26,930
但那不是真的
but that isn't true.

987
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,220
想想看  如果你回到过去
Think about it. If you travel to the past...

988
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:31,390
那过去就是你的未来了
that past becomes your future...

989
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,770
你之前的现在  就成了过去
and your former present becomes the past...

990
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:37,400
它是不能被你的新未来改变的
which can't now be changed by your new future.

991
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,470
没错
Exactly.

992
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,720
所以《回到未来》就是胡扯吗
So Back to the Future is a bunch of bullshit?

993
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:47,730
好  克林特
All right, Clint.

994
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,190
准备  三  二
We're going in three, two...

995
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:52,400

1004
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:39,480
看着我
Look at me.

1005
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:40,300
你没事吧
You okay?

1006
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,170
没事
Yeah.

1007
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:43,630
没事
Yeah.

1008
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:45,970
成功了
It worked.

1009
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:48,930

01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:56,050
{\an8}现实宝石

1015
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:58,440
现在我们得确定时间和地点
Now, we gotta figure out the when and the where.

1016
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:57,550
{\an8}时间宝石

1017
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:58,890
{\an8}灵魂宝石

1018
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,120
这房间里几乎每个人都曾遭遇过
Almost everyone in this room has had an encounter

1019
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:02,710
六颗无限宝石中的至少一颗
with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.

1020
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:04,380
也可以把"遭遇"
Or substitute the word "encounter"

1021
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:05,590
换成"差点被六颗
for "damn near been killed"

1022
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:07,300
无限宝石中的一颗害死"
by one of the six Infinity Stones.

1023
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,370
我没有
Well, I haven't...

1024
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:10,780
但我根本不知道你们在说什么
but I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about.

1025
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:12,240
不管怎样
Regardless,

1026
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:13,970
我们剩的皮姆粒子
we only have enough Pym Particles

1027
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:16,060
只够每人往返一次
for one round-trip each.

1028
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,100
而这些宝石曾在
And these stones have been

1029
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,350
历史上很多不同的地方出现过
in a lot of different places throughout history.

1030
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:20,380
我们的历史
Our history.

1031
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:23,940
所以  我们刚好能去的地方不多  是吧
So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in, yeah?

1032
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,130
所以我们得选好目标
Which means we have to pick our targets.

1033
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,220
没错
Correct.

1034
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,050
那么
So,

1035
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:30,350
先从以太粒子说起
let's start with the Aether.

1036
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:31,930
托尔  你知道些什么
Thor, what do you know?

1037
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:38,560
他睡着了吗
Is he asleep?

1038
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:39,870
不不
No, no.

1039
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:41,400
我肯定他是死了
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

1040
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:44,320
{\an8}现实宝石

1041
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:45,690
从何说起呢
Where to start?

1042
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:50,740
以太粒子  首先  它不是宝石
The Aether, firstly, is not a stone.

1043
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,780
之前有人把它称为宝石
Someone called it a stone before.

1044
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:58,080
它更像是团愤怒的烂泥
It's more of an angry sludge sort of a thing, so

1045
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,970
得有人纠正一下
someone's gonna need to amend that

1046
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,380
别再那么喊它了
and stop saying that.

1047
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,350
关于以太粒子  有个有趣的故事
Here's an interesting story, though, about the Aether.

1048
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,360
我祖父  很多年前
My grandfather, many years ago...

1049
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:10,140
不得不把宝石藏在了黑暗精灵找不到的地方
had to hide the stone from the Dark Elves.

1050
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:12,900
他们可吓人了
Scary beings.

1051
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:14,970
简呢  其实
So, Jane, actually...

1052
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:20,900
{\an8}简·福斯特

1053
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:16,680
她在这儿呢
There she is.

1054
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:20,560
是啊  简是我的老情人
Yeah, so Jane was an old flame of mine.

1055
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:24,940
她有次把手伸进了一块石头里
You know, she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time...

1056
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,070
以太粒子就进入了她体内
and then the Aether stuck itself inside her...

1057
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:30,130
她就病得很重
and she became very, very sick.

1058
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:32,090
我不得不把她带回阿斯加德
And so I had to take her to Asgard,

1059
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:33,340
我的家乡
which is where I'm from...

1060
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,140
我们只能想办法治好她
and we had to try and fix her.

1061
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:36,640
我们当时在约会
We were dating at the time, you see...

1062
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,120
我还把她介绍给了我妈妈
and I got to introduce her to my mother...

1063
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:43,630
她死了
who's dead and, um...

1064
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,730
然后简和我也分手了
Oh, you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, so...

1065
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:51,400
这种事难免嘛
Yes, these things happen, though. You know?

1066
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,940
没什么能天长地久  唯一...
Nothing lasts forever. The only thing that...

1067
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:54,200
-你过来坐下吧  -我没说完呢
- Why don't you come sit down? - I'm not done yet.

1068
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,280
人生中唯一永久不变的
The only thing that is permanent in life

1069
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,720
就是它的无常
is impermanence.

1070
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:01,080
说得太好了  鸡蛋  吃早饭吗
Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?

1071
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,950
不了  我想喝杯血腥玛丽
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

1072
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,980
奎尔说他是在莫拉格偷走了力量宝石
Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.

1074
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:09,400
-那是个人吗  -不  莫拉格是个星球
- Is that a person? - No, Morag's a planet.

1075
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,450
奎尔才是人
Quill was a person.

1076
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:14,550
星球  是在外太空吗
Like a planet? Like in outer space?

1077
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:15,910
看啊
Oh, look.

1078
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:18,830
它就像只小狗  乐哈哈的
It's like a little puppy, all happy and everything.

1079
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:22,140
你想去太空吗  想去吗  狗狗
Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy?

1080
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,540

灭霸在沃密尔星球上找到了灵魂宝石

What is Vormir?

死亡之域
A dominion of death...

1085

灭霸就在那里杀了我姐姐
It's where Thanos murdered my sister.

01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:40,610
好了
All right.

1167
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:43,710
听好了  胖胖
Here's the deal, tubby.

1168
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:44,710
你来迷倒她
You're gonna charm her,

1169
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:46,050
我拿这个戳倒她
and I'm gonna poke her with this thing

1170
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:48,910
抽走现实宝石  然后就麻溜走人
and extract the Reality Stone, and get gone lickety-split.

1171
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:51,390
我马上回来  好吗
I'll be right back, okay?

1172
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:53,510
酒窖就在这边
The wine cellar is just down here.

1173
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:56,390
我父亲以前藏了几大桶的俄科尼麦芽酒
My father used to have this huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

1174
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:58,540
我去碗碟室看看有没有外带杯
I'll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cups.

1175
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:00,550
你不是已经喝醉了吗
Aren't you drunk enough already?

1176
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:08,610
麻烦你给洛基送点汤过去
If you could send Loki some soup.

1177
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:09,240
是  陛下
Yes, milady.

1178
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,450
叫我们的图书管理员
And ask our librarians

1179
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:13,390
去天文区拿几卷书来
to pull some volumes from the astronomy shelf.

1180
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:21,020
那个贵气的女人是谁
Who's the fancy broad?

1181
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:23,530
我妈妈
That's my mother.

1182
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:25,740
她今天会死
She dies today.

1183
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:28,620
是今天吗
That is today?

1184
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:37,870
我做不到
I can't do this. I can't do this.

1185
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,630
我不该来的
I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.

1186
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:41,250
这是个坏主意
It's a bad idea!

1187
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:42,520
-过来  -不不
- Come here. - No, no, no.

1188
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,190
我觉得我恐慌发作了
I think I'm having a panic attack.

1189
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:46,570
-过来  -我不该来的
- Come here. - I shouldn't be here.

1190
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:47,510
-这里  -这不妙
- Right here. - This is bad.

1191
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,860
你以为只有你失去了人吗
You think you're the only one who lost people?

1192
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:51,550
你以为我们在干什么
What do you think we're doing here?

1193
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:53,860
我失去了我唯一曾拥有过的家庭
I lost the only family I ever had.

1194
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:56,830
奎尔  格鲁特  德拉克斯  触角妹
Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna...

1195
01:10:56,830 --> 01:10:57,940
都没了
all gone.

1196
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:00,450
我理解你想你妈妈
I get you miss your mom...

1197
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:01,960
但她死了
but she's gone.

1198
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,120
真死了
Really gone.

1199
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:06,320
但还有很多人只是不在了
And there are plenty of people who are only kind of gone...

1200
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:07,900
你可以帮他们
and you can help them.

1201
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:10,130
所以这个要求过分吗
So, is it too much to ask

1202
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:12,120
把你胡子里的食物渣子掸掉
that you brush the crumbs out of your beard...

1203
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:14,510
去哄那个漂亮妞
make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants...

1204
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:17,930
趁她不备  吸走无限宝石
and when she's not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone...

1205
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:20,040
然后帮我找回家人
and help me get my family back?

1206
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:21,960
好
Okay.

1207
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,750
你哭了吗
Are you crying?

1208
01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:25,210
没有
No.

1209
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:28,300
对
Yes.

1210
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,860
我觉得我要不行了
I feel like I'm losing it.

1211
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:30,860
振作起来
Get it together!

1212
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:32,050
你可以的
You can do this.

1213
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:34,560
你可以的
You can do this.

1214
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:38,640
好吗
All right?

1215
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:40,060
我可以的
Yes, I can.

1216
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:40,980
很好
Good.

1217
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,610
我可以的
I can do this. I can do this.

1218
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:47,820
我做不到
I can't do this.

1219
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,840
好了  女人杀手  她现在就一个人
All right, heartbreaker, she's alone.

1220
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,070
我们的机会来了
This is our shot.

1221
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:52,320
托尔
Thor?

1222
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,200
托尔
Thor!

1223
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,580
{\an8}{\pos(196.8,183.467)}莫格拉

1224
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,130
好  降下来  小蓝
All right, bring it down, Blue.

1225
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:08,300
对准那条线  没错  再往下
Right on that line. That's it. Down, down.

1226
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:14,780
能快点的吗
Can we hurry it up?

1227
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:16,970
各位  快点  我们赶时间呢
Guys, chop-chop. Come on. We're on the clock.

1228
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:19,310
这么催真的很有帮助
All that is really helpful.

1229
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,730
-要小心  好吗  -嗯
- Take care, okay? - Yeah.

1230
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,110
拿到宝石就回来  别干别的
Get that stone and come back. No messing around.

1231
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:27,630
我们行的
We got this.

1232
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:28,830
-我们搞定这事吧  -好的
- Let's get it done. - Yes, sir.

1233
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:29,780
回头见
I'll see you back.

1234
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:32,910
你们彼此照应着点
You guys watch each other's six.

1235
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:33,820
嗯
Yeah.

1236
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:44,880
沃密尔星球的坐标已输入
Coordinates for Vormir are laid in.

1237
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:48,170
他们只要不跌出来就行
All they have to do is not fall out.

1238
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:56,050
我们离布达佩斯可很远了
We're a long way from Budapest.

1239
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,560
好吧
Okay, so, uh...

1240
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:07,290
我们就等着这个奎尔出现
we just wait around for this Quill guy to show up...

1241
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:09,400
然后他就会带我们找到力量宝石  是吗
and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?

1242
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:11,650
我们找掩护吧
Let's take cover.

1243
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:15,760
2014年时  我们不是唯一在找宝石的人
We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.

1244
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:17,380
等等  你在说什么呢
Wait a minute. What are you talking about right now?

1245
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:18,990
还有谁在找宝石
Who else is looking for these stones?

1246
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:23,290
我父亲
My father...

1247
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:24,920
我姐姐
my sister...

1248
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:26,840
和我
and me.

1249
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:28,170
还有你
And you?

1250
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:31,420
你现在在哪
Where are you right now?

1251
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:01,540
不客气
You're welcome.

1252
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,040
我没叫你帮忙
I didn't ask for your help.

1253
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,830
但你总需要我帮
And yet, you always need it.

1254
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:12,730
起来  父亲要我们回飞船上
Get up. Father wants us back on the ship.

1255
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:13,460
为什么
Why?

1256
01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:15,720
他找到了一颗无限宝石
He's found an Infinity Stone.

1257
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:20,930
在哪
Where?

1258
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:23,770
在一颗叫莫格拉的星球上
On a planet called Morag.

1259
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,270
父亲的计划总算开始运作了
Father's plan is finally in motion.

1260
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:29,250
一颗宝石可不比六颗  星云
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

1261
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:30,480
这是个开始
It's a start.

1262
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,780
如果他能拿到全部...
If he gets all of them...

1263
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:47,390
罗南已找到了力量宝石
Ronan's located the Power Stone.

1264
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:49,270
我要派你们去他的飞船上
I'm dispatching you to his ship.

1265
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:50,710
他不会高兴的
He won't like that.

1266
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:52,840
他不配合就得死
His alternative is death.

1267
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:56,010
罗南的执迷
Ronan's obsession...

1268
01:14:57,070 --> 01:14:59,010
影响了他的判断力
clouds his judgment.

1269
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,430
我们不会让你失望的  父亲
We will not fail you, Father.

1270
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:08,020
是啊  你不会的
No, you won't.

1271
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,480
我发誓
I swear...

1272
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,740
我会让你骄傲的
I will make you proud.

1273
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:27,470
我们就等着这个奎尔出现
...we just wait around for this Quill guy to show up...

1274
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:29,540
然后他就会带我们找到力量宝石  是吗
and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?

1275
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:31,710
我们找掩护吧
Let's take cover.

1276
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:36,210
2014年时  我们不是唯一在找宝石的人
We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.

1277
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:39,300
那是谁
Who was that?

1278
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:40,530
我不知道
I don't know.

1279
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:42,890
我头痛欲裂  我不知道
My head is splitting. I don't know.

1280
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:47,560
她的突触驱动可能在打斗中损伤了
Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle.

1281
01:15:57,790 --> 01:15:59,490
把她带上我的飞船
Bring her to my ship.

1282
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:08,300
快点吧  队长
Better hustle, Cap.

1283
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:10,220
这边看上去像是快要完事了
Things look like they're just about wrapped up here.

1284
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:12,380
收到  我正在往电梯去
Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now.

1285
01:16:18,690 --> 01:16:20,430
如果你们不介意
If it's all the same to you...

1286
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:24,430
我现在想来一杯
I'll have that drink now.

1287
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,220
好  把他拉起来
All right, get him on his feet.

1288
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:29,060
我们稍后再傻站着摆姿势吧
We can all stand around posing up a storm later.

1289
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:31,270
对了  你们可以收拾一下
By the way, feel free to clean up.

1290
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:34,120
罗杰斯先生  我差点忘了  那身战衣
Mr. Rogers, I almost forgot that that suit...

1291
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,920
太不衬你的屁股了
did nothing for your ass.

1292
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,370
你非得看吗  托尼
No one asked you to look, Tony.

1293
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:37,960
真荒唐
It's ridiculous.

1294
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,440
我觉得你很帅  队长
I think you look great, Cap.

1295
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:42,460
在我看来  那就是美国屁股
As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass.

1296
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:44,300
魔杖归谁
Who gets the, uh, magic wand?

1297
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,030
突击队正在赶来收走它
S.T.R.I.K.E. Team's coming to secure it.

1298
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,000
那个交给我们吧
We can take that off your hands.

1299
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,710
请吧
By all means.

1300
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,010
小心哦
Careful with that thing.

1301
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:05,150
是啊  除非你想被抹除思想
Yeah, unless you want your mind erased.

1302
01:17:05,150 --> 01:17:06,280
而且可不好玩
And not in a fun way.

1303
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,490
我们一定小心
We promise to be careful.

1304
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:08,490
他们是谁
Who are these guys?

1305
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:10,060
他们是神盾局的
They are S.H.I.E.L.D.

1306
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:13,290
但其实是九头蛇的  但我们当时不知道
Well, actually Hydra, but we didn't know that yet.

1307
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:15,100
真的吗  你们不知道
Seriously? You didn't? I mean,

1308
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:17,210
他们一看就不像好人啊
they look like bad guys.

1309
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:18,960
你虽然个头小  但好聒噪
You're small, but you're talking loud.

1310
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,880
这就下去协调搜救工作
On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.

1311
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,170
这就下去协调搜救工作
On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.

1312
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:25,840
真的  你怎么做到不吐的
I mean, honestly, how do you keep your food down?

1313
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,160
闭嘴
Shut up.

1314
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:29,340
好  该你上了  小伙计
All right, you're up, little buddy.

1315
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:30,830
我们的宝石在那里呢
There's our stone.

1316
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:32,410
好
All right.

1317
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:33,830
弹我
Flick me.

1318
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:48,850
让开
Move.

1319
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:50,910
伙计
Buddy!

1320
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:53,280
你怎么想的  已达到承载上限了
What do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached.

1321
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:53,950
走楼梯吧
Take the stairs.

1322
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:56,060
是啊  别别
Yeah. Stop, stop.

1323
01:17:58,830 --> 01:18:01,690
"走楼梯"  讨厌楼梯
"Take the stairs." Hate the stairs.

1324
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:07,840
好了  队长  权杖在电梯里
All right, Cap, I got our scepter in the elevator...

1325
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,950
刚过80层
just passing the 80th floor.

1326
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:11,700
知道了
On it.

1327
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:13,260
去大堂
Head to the lobby.

1328
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:14,330
好  在那里碰头
All right, I'll see you there.

1329
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,040
证据已收押
Evidence secure.

1330
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:17,790
我们这就去找李斯特博士
We're en route to Doctor List.

1331
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:21,460
不  毫无意外  部长先生
No. No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary.

1332
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:27,610
队长
Captain.

1333
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:29,640
我以为你去协调搜救行动了
I thought you were coordinating search and rescue.

1334
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:31,260
计划有变
Change of plans.

1335
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,270
队长
Hey, Cap.

1336

朗姆洛

我刚接到了部长的电话
I just got a call from the secretary.

1338

权杖的事将由我负责
I'm gonna be running point on the scepter.

1339
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:54,080
长官  我不懂
Sir? I don't understand.

1340
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:58,350
我们收到消息  可能有人会企图偷它
We got word there may be an attempt to steal it.

1341
01:18:58,350 --> 01:18:59,380
抱歉  队长
Sorry, Cap.

1342
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:01,630
我们不能把权杖给你
We can't give you the scepter.

1343
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:03,960
我得打给局长
I'm gonna have to call the director.

1344
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:06,260
没事  相信我
That's okay. Trust me.

1345
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:11,100
九头蛇万岁
Hail Hydra.

1346
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:27,360
好多楼梯啊
So many stairs!

1347
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:41,850
拇指姑娘  收到吗  我看到目标了
Thumbelina, do you copy? I've got eyes on the prize.

1348
01:19:41,850 --> 01:19:43,020
可以开始了
It is go time.

1349
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,210
炸吧
Bombs away.

1350
01:19:51,490 --> 01:19:53,950
那是AXE香氛吗
Is that Axe Body Spray?

1351
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:56,570
对  我桌子里常备一罐应急的  放松啦
Yeah, I had a can in the desk for emergencies. Relax.

1352
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:57,530
可以专心点吗
Can we focus, please?

1353
01:19:57,530 --> 01:19:59,060
我要进入你了
I'm going inside you...

1354
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:00,650
行动
now.

1355
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,880
可以问问你们要去哪吗
May I ask you where you're going?

1356
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,420
吃点午饭  然后去阿斯加德
Bit of lunch and then Asgard.

1357
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,500
抱歉  你是...
I'm sorry, you are...?

1358
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:11,550
亚历山大·皮尔斯
Alexander Pierce.

1359
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:13,920
他是尼克·弗瑞背后老大的老大
He's the man above the folks behind Nick Fury.

1360
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:15,510
我的朋友喊我部长先生
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.

1361
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:18,120
我得请你把那位犯人交给我
I'm gonna have to ask you to turn that prisoner over to me.

1362
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:20,140
洛基会去向奥丁做个交待的
Loki will be answering to Odin himself.

1363
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:21,310
不  他得向我们做交待
No, he's going to answer to us.

1364
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:22,520
我们审过了再给奥丁
Odin can have what's left.

1365
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,880
我还要拿走那个箱子
And I'm gonna need that case.

1366
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:26,020
那七十多年来都是神盾局的财产
That's been S.H.I.E.L.D. property for over 70 years.

1367
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:27,340
交出箱子  斯塔克
Hand over the case, Stark.

1368
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,580
好  行动吧  精灵鼠小弟
All right, move it, Stuart Little.

1369
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:29,720
这边情况有点麻烦了  快点的
Things are getting dicey out here. Let's go.

1370
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:32,030
我不打算争论这里谁的权力更高
I'm not gonna argue who's got the higher authority here...

1371
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:33,550
你保证你不会死吗
You promise me you won't die?

1372
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:36,780
我们只是要让我稍稍心律失常
We're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

1373
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:38,350
那听上去很暴力啊
That doesn't sound mild.

1374
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:39,280
我需要那个箱子
I need the case.

1375
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,830
我知道你权力挺大的  我只是说
I know you got a lot of pull, I'm just saying,

1376
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:42,080
-管辖权...  -好吧  那给我箱子
- jurisdiction... - Okay, then give me the case.

1377
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,120
管辖权...
Well, jurisdiction...

1378
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,560
交出来
Hand it over.

1379
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:45,660
动手  朗
Do it, Lang!

1380
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:46,460
手拿开
Get your hands off me.

1381
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:48,360
快没时间了  拔线
Window's closing. Pull my pin.

1382
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:49,780
来了
Here goes!

1383
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,320
-斯塔克  -斯塔克
- Stark? - Stark?

1384
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:56,970
他在抽搐  给他点空间
He's convulsing. Give him air!

1385
01:20:56,970 --> 01:20:58,700
-医务人员  -医务人员
- Medic! - Medic!

1386
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:00,500
他们需要帮助
Give these guys some help.

1387
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:01,910
说话啊
Speak to me.

1388
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:04,420
斯塔克  是你的胸口机器吗
Stark, is it your chest machine?

1389
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:08,380
呼吸
Breathe, breathe.

1390
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:14,780
好样的  巷子里见
Good job. Meet me in the alley.

1391
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:16,180
我去找点吃的
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

1392
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:23,940
不走楼梯
No stairs!

1393
01:21:31,210 --> 01:21:32,790
拜托  斯塔克  保持清醒
Come on, Stark, stay with us.

1394
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,710
我要试个办法  好吗
I'm going to try something. Okay?

1395
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:35,070
我也不知道行不行
I have no idea if it's going to work.

1396
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:38,260
好啊
Yes!

1397
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,490
非常行啊
That worked a treat.

1398
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,640
哥们  真疯狂
Dude, that was so crazy.

1399
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,160
我完全不知道那行不行
I had no idea if that was gonna work.

1400
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:44,080
-箱子呢  -箱子
- The case. - The case is, uh...

1401
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:46,580
箱子呢  洛基呢
Where's the case? Where's Loki?

1402
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:48,250
洛基
Loki!

1403
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:49,690
那不符合计划  是吧
That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?

1404
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:50,920
我们搞砸了
Oh, we blew it.

1405
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,550
洛基
Loki?

1406
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:56,300
托尼  怎么回事
Tony, what's going on?

1407
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:58,550
告诉我你找到魔方了
Tell me you found that Cube.

1408
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,560
开什么玩笑
You gotta be shitting me.

1409
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,480
看到洛基了  14楼
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.

1410
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:10,780
我不是洛基
I'm not Loki...

1411
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:16,030
我也不想伤害你
and I don't wanna hurt you.

1412
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:26,100
我可以和你耗一整天
I can do this all day.

1413
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:27,250
我知道
Yeah, I know.

1414
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,580
我知道
I know.

1415
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:02,870
你从哪拿到的
Where did you get this?

1416
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:14,600
巴基
Bucky

1417
01:23:14,610 --> 01:23:15,420
还
is

1418
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,590
活着
alive.

1419
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:20,970
什么
What?

1420
01:23:36,130 --> 01:23:37,780
确实是美国屁股
That is America's ass.

1421
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:43,610
-拜托了  -对不起
- Please, please. - I'm sorry,

1422
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:45,240
我帮不了你  布鲁斯
I can't help you, Bruce.

1423
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:47,430
如果我交出时间宝石
If I give up the Time Stone

1424
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:49,640
帮助你的现实  就是毁了我的现实
to help your reality, I'm dooming my own.

1425
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,180
恕我直言
With all due respect, all right...

1426
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:54,550
我觉得科学并不支持你这个说法
I'm not sure the science really supports that.

1427
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:01,570
无限宝石
The Infinity Stones

1428
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:04,430
创造了你所感知的时间流
create what you experience as the flow of time.

1429
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:06,220
如果拿走一颗宝石
Remove one of the stones...

1430
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:08,140
就会产生支流
and that flow splits.

1431
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:10,980
这或许对你的现实有好处
Now, this may benefit your reality...

1432
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:13,690
但对我新的这个  就不好了
but my new one, not so much.

1433
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:15,790
在这个新的支流现实里
In this new branch reality...

1434
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:17,330
没有了我们对抗
without our chief weapon

1435
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:19,070
黑暗力量的首要武器
against the forces of darkness...

1436
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:21,130
我们的世界会被颠覆
our world would be overrun.

1437
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:22,870
数百万人会蒙受灾难
Millions will suffer.

1438
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:24,620
告诉我  博士
So, tell me, Doctor.

1439
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,300
你的科学能阻止这一切吗
Can your science prevent all that?

1440
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:28,200
不能
No...

1441
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:30,560
但我们可以抹除它
but we can erase it.

1442
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,350
因为我们用完宝石后
Because once we're done with the stones...

1443
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:34,600
我们可以把每一颗拿回原来的时间点
we can return each one to its own timeline...

1444
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,230
放回被拿走的那一刻
at the moment it was taken.

1445
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:38,630
这样  从时间上讲
So, chronologically...

1446
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,680
在那个现实里
in that reality...

1447
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:44,800
它就根本没被拿走过
it never left.

1448
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:50,350
是啊  但你漏掉了最重要的部分
Yes, but you're leaving out the most important part.

1449
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:56,870
要还回宝石  你们得能幸存下来
In order to return the stones, you have to survive.

1450
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:59,820
我们会的  我会的  我保证
We will. I will. I promise.

1451
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:02,780
我不能为了一句承诺拿这个现实冒险
I can't risk this reality on a promise.

1452
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:06,720
至尊法师有责任
It's the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme

1453
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,740
保护时间宝石
to protect the Time Stone.

1454
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:11,330
那斯特兰奇为什么把它交了出去
Then why the hell did Strange give it away?

1455
01:25:12,890 --> 01:25:13,930
你说什么
What did you say?

1456
01:25:13,930 --> 01:25:16,880
斯特兰奇  他把宝石交给了灭霸
Strange. He gave it away. He gave it to Thanos.

1457
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:18,840
-自愿的吗  -是的
- Willingly? - Yes.

1458
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:24,280
-为什么  -我不知道
- Why? - I have no idea.

1459
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,840
或许他错了
Maybe he made a mistake.

1460
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:37,610
或是我错了
Or I did.

1461
01:25:57,770 --> 01:26:00,300
斯特兰奇将成为我们中最优秀的
Strange is meant to be the best of us.

1462
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:03,170
所以他那么做肯定是有原因的
So, he must've done it for a reason.

1463
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:05,590
你恐怕是对的
I fear you might be right.

1464
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:11,310
谢谢
Thank you.

1465
01:26:17,790 --> 01:26:19,650
我指望你了  布鲁斯
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1466
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:22,690
我们都指望你了
We all are.

1467
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:44,800
运行诊断
Run diagnostics.

1468
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,090
给我看她的记忆文件
Show me her memory file.

1469
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:51,640
大人  文件似乎凌乱了
Sire, the file appears entangled.

虽然有段记忆  但不属于她

这个二重身有时间戳

在我们太阳系里的莫格拉上

1478
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,730
你能读取她吗

01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:24,550
能  她俩是相连的

我们的历史  所以

1485
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:40,370
我们刚好能去的地方不多  是吧
not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in, yeah?

1486
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:42,580
所以我们得选好目标
Which means we have to pick our targets.

1487
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:44,230
-没错  -定格
- Correct. - Freeze image.

那个倒影是什么
What's that reflection?

放大它  乌木喉
Amplify this, Maw.

1493
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:01,920
我不懂
I don't understand.

两个星云

1495

不  是一个星云
No. The same Nebula...

1496
01:28:11,610 --> 01:28:13,390
来自两个时间
from two different times.

1497
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:16,320
设置航向去莫格拉
Set course for Morag.

1498
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,350
并扫描那个二重身的记忆

我想看到一切

女士们  稍后见
My ladies, I'll see you after.

1501

你们先去吧
I'll see you after. Go on ahead.

1502
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:50,720
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1503
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:53,570
天呐
Oh, God!

1504
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:56,200
偷偷摸摸这种事最好还是交给你弟弟
You're better off leaving the sneaking to your brother.

1505
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,700
我没偷偷摸摸  我就是出来走走
No, I wasn't sneaking. I was just going for a walk.

1506

记得海拉根战役吗
Remember the, uh, Battle of Harokin...

1511
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,740
我被大刀击中了脸
when I got hit in the face with the broadsword?

1512
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:20,250
你根本不是我认识的托尔  是吧
You're not the Thor I know at all, are you?

1513
01:29:20,510 --> 01:29:21,710
我是的
Yes, I am.

1514
01:29:22,850 --> 01:29:25,500
看来未来对你很不好  是吧
The future hasn't been kind to you, has it?

1515
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,670
我没说我是未来来的
I didn't say I was from the future.

1516
01:29:28,150 --> 01:29:30,300
我是被女巫养大的  孩子
I was raised by witches, boy.

1517
01:29:31,610 --> 01:29:34,300
我看东西不光靠眼睛  你知道的
I see with more than eyes, you know that.

1518
01:29:35,990 --> 01:29:38,490
是啊  我就是从未来来的
Yeah, I'm totally from the future.

1519
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:40,490
是啊  亲爱的
Yes, you are, honey.

1520
01:29:40,490 --> 01:29:42,180
我真的需要跟你谈谈
I really need to talk to you.

1521
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:43,230
我们可以谈谈
We can talk.

1522
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,170
他的脑袋在这边
His head was over there...

1523
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,510
他的身体在另一边
and his body over there...

1524
01:30:13,570 --> 01:30:15,930
有什么意义呢  我太迟了
I mean, what was the point? I was too late.

1525
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:18,350
我就傻站在那里
I was just standing there.

1526
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:21,070
一个拿着斧头的白痴
Some idiot with an axe.

1527
01:30:21,070 --> 01:30:23,230
你才不是白痴
Now, you're no idiot.

1528
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:25,480
你不是来这儿了吗
You're here, aren't you?

1529
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:28,610
向阿斯加德最睿智的人寻求建议
Seeking counsel from the wisest person in Asgard.

1530
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:29,860
是啊
I am. Yes.

1531
01:30:29,870 --> 01:30:31,230
不是白痴
Idiot, no.

1532
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:32,940
失败呢
A failure?

1533
01:30:33,130 --> 01:30:34,500
的确
Absolutely.

1534
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:35,750
这有点残忍了吧
That's a little bit harsh.

1535
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,570
知道那意味着你什么吗
Do you know what that makes you?

1536
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,660
跟其他人一样
Just like everyone else.

1537
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:43,410
我不是该与众不同的吗
I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, am I?

1538
01:30:44,430 --> 01:30:47,750
每个人都会辜负他人的期待  托尔
Everyone fails at who they're supposed to be, Thor.

1539
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:51,090
衡量一个人  一个英雄的标准
The measure of a person, of a hero...

1540
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:54,840
是他们能把真实的自己做得多好
is how well they succeed at being who they are.

1541
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:01,470
我真的好想你  妈妈
I've really missed you, Mom.

1542
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:09,610
托尔  我拿到了
Thor! I got it!

1543
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,480
抓住那只兔子
Get that rabbit!

1544
01:31:14,630 --> 01:31:16,500
妈妈  我有事要告诉你
Mom, I have to tell you something.

1545
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,160
不  儿子  你不用说
No, son, you don't.

1546
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:21,260
你是来修复你的未来的  不是我的
You're here to repair your future, not mine.

1547
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:24,580
-这就是关于你的未来  -那我管不着
- This is about your future.  - It's none of my business.

1548
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,340
你就是妈妈吧
You must be Mom.

1549
01:31:31,940 --> 01:31:33,810
我拿到了  我们得走了
I got the thing. Come on. We gotta move.

1550
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:35,060
真希望我们还有时间
I wish we had more time.

1551
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:37,340
不  这已是恩赐
No, this was a gift.

1552
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:40,180
你去做你该成为的那个人吧
Now you go and be the man you're meant to be.

1553
01:31:41,150 --> 01:31:42,240
我爱你  妈妈
I love you, Mom.

1554
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:43,560
我爱你
I love you.

1555
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:49,600
吃点蔬菜吧
And eat a salad.

1556
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:52,020
好了  我们得走了
Come on, we gotta go.

1557
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:53,320
-再见  -三
- Goodbye. - Three...

1558
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:54,980
-二  -不  等等
- Two... - No, wait!

1559
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,300
什么情况啊
What am I looking at?

1560
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:01,490
有时得需要点时间
Sometimes it takes a second.

1561
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:11,960
我还有资格
I'm still worthy.

1562
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:14,840
天呐
Oh, boy.

1563
01:32:16,610 --> 01:32:18,670
-再见  妈妈  -再见
- Goodbye, Mom. - Goodbye.

1564
01:32:57,730 --> 01:32:59,010
所以  他是个白痴吗
So, he's an idiot?

1565
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:01,840
对
Yeah.

1566
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:11,690
那是什么
What's that?

1567
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:13,350
贼的工具
The tool of a thief.

1568
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:25,510
按说这时候就会有尖刺冒出来
This is the part where you know, spikes come out...

1569
01:33:25,510 --> 01:33:27,130
上面还插着骷髅
with skeletons on the end of them and everything.

1570
01:33:27,130 --> 01:33:27,930
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

1571
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:29,300
当你闯入什么
When you break into a place called

1572
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:30,850
"力量宝石神殿"时
"The Temple of the Power Stone"...

1573
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:32,310
肯定会有一堆陷阱的
there's gonna be a bunch of booby traps.

1574
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:34,170
-天呐  -好吧  行啊  你去吧
- Oh, my God. - Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1575
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,620
我并不一直是如此的
I wasn't always like this.

1576
01:34:10,510 --> 01:34:11,410
我也一样
Me either.

1577
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:14,870
但我们只能尽力而为了  是吧
But we work with what we got, right?

1578
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:19,540
我们同步吧
Let's sync up.

1579

你杀了数万亿生灵

01:34:38,710 --> 01:34:40,320
你应该感激

宝石在哪

没了
Gone.

1584
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,260
化成原子了
Reduced to atoms.

1585
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:49,160
你两天前还用过的
You used them two days ago!

1586
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:52,180
我用宝石摧毁了宝石
I used the stones to destroy the stones.

1587
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:54,390
差点要了我的命
It nearly killed me.

1588
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:56,210
但大业已成
But the work is done.

1589
01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:58,670
注定会完成的
It always will be.

1590
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:03,130
我是宿命
I am inevitable.

1591
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,010
你对他们做了什么
What did you do to them?

1592
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:07,510
没什么
Nothing.

1593
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:09,800
还没做呢
Yet.

1594
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:13,320
他们不是想阻止我要在
They're not trying to stop something

1595
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:15,310
我们的时间里做的事
I'm going to do in our time.

1596
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:17,620
他们是想撤销我已在
They're trying to undo something

1597
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:19,540
他们的时间里做了的事
I've already done in theirs.

1598
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:20,770
宝石
The stones.

1599

1607
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:52,550
也许我过去对你太残酷了
Perhaps I treated you too harshly.

1608
01:35:56,870 --> 01:35:59,600
那就是实现了命运
And that is destiny fulfilled.

1609
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,150
大人
Sire...

1610
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:02,770

你会有机会证明的
And you'll have the chance to prove it.

1618
01:36:31,150 --> 01:36:32,090

No!

1619

Well, what are we gonna do now?

1631
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:14,530
饶了我吧  史蒂夫
You know what? Give me a break, Steve.

1632
01:37:14,530 --> 01:37:16,140
我刚被绿巨人砸了脑袋
I just got hit in the head with the Hulk.

1633
01:37:16,450 --> 01:37:17,910
你说我们只有一次机会的
You said that we had one shot.

1634
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:19,450
这就是我们的机会
This was our shot.

1635
01:37:19,450 --> 01:37:20,700
我们试了  没机会了
We shot it. It's shot.

1636
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:21,530
六颗宝石  不然就不行
Six stones or nothing.

1637
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:22,120
六颗宝石  不然就不行
It was six stones or nothing.

1638
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:23,410
你在重复自己的话  知道吗
You're repeating yourself, you know that?

1639
01:37:23,410 --> 01:37:24,000
你在重复自己的话
You're repeating yourself.

1640
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,710
你才在重复自己的话
You're repeating yourself. You're repeating yourself.

1641
01:37:25,710 --> 01:37:26,710
-不  -哥们
- You know, no. - Dude.

1642
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:28,290
-行了  -你当初就不想进行时间盗窃
- Come on! - You never wanted a time heist.

1643
01:37:28,290 --> 01:37:29,330
你不赞成时间盗窃
You weren't on board with the Time Heist.

1644
01:37:29,330 --> 01:37:30,590
-我搞砸了  -你毁了时间盗窃
- I dropped the ball. - You ruined the Time Heist.

1645
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:31,750
-是吗  -是啊
- Is that what I did? - Yeah.

1646
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:33,550
宇宙魔方还有其他选择吗
Are there any other options with the Tesseract?

1647
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:35,550
没了  没有其他选择
No, no, no, there's no other options.

1648
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:36,550
没法重来
There's no do-overs.

1649
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:39,090
我们别想去别的地方了  我们只剩一剂粒子了
We're not going anywhere else. We have one particle left.

1650
01:37:39,090 --> 01:37:40,050
每人一剂
Each.

1651
01:37:40,050 --> 01:37:42,500
就这些了  好吗  我们用了
That's it. All right? We use that...

1652
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:43,850
再见了  别想回家了
bye-bye, you're not going home.

1653
01:37:43,850 --> 01:37:45,540
如果我们不试试
Yeah, well, if we don't try...

1654
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:47,850
那别人也都别想回家了
then no one else is going home, either.

1655
01:37:47,850 --> 01:37:48,750
我知道了
I got it.

1656
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:51,610
还有别的办法能拿到宇宙魔方
There's another way to retake the Tesseract

1657
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:54,010
并拿到更多粒子
and acquire new particles.

1658
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:56,180
回忆一下
Little stroll down memory lane.

1659

它们都在...我大致知道是什么时候
They were there at a time... I have a vaguely exact idea.

1663

1666
01:38:14,050 --> 01:38:15,410
伙计们  怎么回事
Guys, what is it?

1667
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:17,880
看来我们得即兴发挥了
Looks like we're improvising.

1668
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:19,300
-好  -什么即兴发挥

Look, if you do this...

1680
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,930
但不成功  你们就回不来了

1691
01:39:19,650 --> 01:39:21,100

I'll look at the weather projections.

1776
01:44:47,110 --> 01:44:49,220
这可不是雷击
It's not lightning strikes we're looking at.

1777
01:45:00,490 --> 01:45:02,200
名字想得怎么样了
So, where you at with names?

1778
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:05,440
如果是男孩  我妻子想叫埃蒙泽
Well, if it's a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo.

1779
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:08,480
还是再考虑考虑吧  还有时间呢
Might wanna let that stew awhile. You got time.

1780
01:45:10,590 --> 01:45:11,780
我问问你
Let me ask you a question.

1781
01:45:13,010 --> 01:45:14,280
你孩子出生时
When your kid was born,

1782
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:16,380
你紧张吗
were you nervous?

1783
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:17,240
可紧张了
Wildly.

1784
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:19,800
-是啊  -你觉得自己够格吗
- Yeah. - Did you feel qualified?

1785
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:21,680
你知道
Like you had any idea

1786
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:23,720
要怎么成功操作那玩意吗
how to successfully operate that thing?

1787
01:45:23,730 --> 01:45:26,770
我真的是一边干一边学的
I literally pieced it together as I went along.

1788
01:45:26,770 --> 01:45:29,010
我回想了我爸爸是怎么做的
I thought about what my dad did.

1789
01:45:29,610 --> 01:45:32,430
我老爸  他什么问题都用皮带解决
My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt.

1790
01:45:32,530 --> 01:45:34,530
我以前觉得我爸爸对我很严厉
I thought my dad was tough on me.

1791
01:45:34,530 --> 01:45:35,820
而如今回想起来
And now, looking back on it,

1792
01:45:35,820 --> 01:45:37,220
我只记得那些美好的回忆
I just remember the good stuff.

1793
01:45:37,490 --> 01:45:39,270
他偶尔也说过些金句
You know? He did drop the odd pearl.

1794
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:40,810
是吗  比如呢
Yeah? Like what?

1795
01:45:41,790 --> 01:45:44,310
"千金难买寸光阴"
"No amount of money ever bought a second of time."

1796
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:46,810
他很睿智
Smart guy.

1797
01:45:47,210 --> 01:45:48,320
他尽力了
He did his best.

1798
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:51,490
我跟你说  那孩子还没出生
I'll tell you, that kid's not even here yet

1799
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:53,570
我已经愿意为他付出一切了
and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him.

1800
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:03,540
很高兴认识你  波茨
Good to meet you, Potts.

1801
01:46:04,770 --> 01:46:05,790
我也是
Yeah.

1802
01:46:05,930 --> 01:46:06,880
霍华德
Howard...

1803
01:46:07,810 --> 01:46:09,250
一切都会没事的
everything's gonna be all right.

1804
01:46:12,230 --> 01:46:13,130
谢谢你
Thank you...

1805
01:46:14,650 --> 01:46:15,680
做的一切
for everything...

1806
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:17,970
为这个国家做的一切
you've done for this country.

1807
01:46:21,450 --> 01:46:22,310
贾维斯
Jarvis.

1808
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:27,400
我们见过那个人吗
Have we ever met that guy?

1809
01:46:29,830 --> 01:46:31,400
您每天会见到很多人  先生
You meet a lot of people, sir.

1810
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:35,150
看着很眼熟
Seems very familiar.

1811
01:46:36,510 --> 01:46:37,660
胡子挺怪的
Weird beard.

1812
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:47,330
你好弱
You're weak.

1813
01:46:47,770 --> 01:46:49,040
我就是你
I'm you.

1814
01:47:06,410 --> 01:47:08,020
你可以阻止这一切
You could stop this.

1815
01:47:08,830 --> 01:47:10,820
你知道你想的
You know you want to.

1816
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,690
你看到未来发生了什么吗
Did you see what happens in the future?

1817
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:17,360
灭霸拿到了灵魂宝石
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1818
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:20,580
你想知道他是怎么拿到的吗
You wanna know how he does that?

1819
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:26,580
你想知道他对你做了什么吗
You wanna know what he does to you?

1820
01:47:26,890 --> 01:47:27,920
够了
That's enough.

1821
01:47:40,610 --> 01:47:42,220
你让我恶心
You disgust me.

1822
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:47,770
但这不代表你毫无用处
But that doesn't mean you're useless.

1823
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:11,380
我看起来怎么样
How do I look?

1824
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:16,380
{\an8}{\pos(194,183.467)}沃密尔星球

1825
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:22,050
要不是在这种情况下
Under different circumstances...

1826
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:25,350
这本会很赞的
this would be totally awesome.

1827
01:48:37,630 --> 01:48:39,780
我敢说那浣熊不用爬山
I bet the raccoon didn't have to climb a mountain.

1828
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:42,630
严格说  他也不是浣熊
Technically he's not a raccoon, you know?

1829
01:48:42,630 --> 01:48:44,370
随便  反正他吃垃圾
Whatever. He eats garbage.

1830
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:45,530
欢迎
Welcome.

1831
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:50,160

伊迪丝之子
Son of Edith.

1835
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:03,010
你是谁
Who are you?

1836
01:49:03,950 --> 01:49:06,060
就当我是向导
Consider me a guide...

1837
01:49:06,570 --> 01:49:07,600
指引你们
to you...

1838
01:49:07,950 --> 01:49:10,240
和所有人寻找灵魂宝石的人
and to all who seek the Soul Stone.

1839
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:11,450
很好
Oh, good.

1840
01:49:11,450 --> 01:49:13,980
你告诉我们宝石在哪  我们马上就去
You tell us where it is, then we'll be on our way.

1841
01:49:14,910 --> 01:49:16,150
亲爱的
Liebling.

1842
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:19,610
要是那么简单就好了
If only it were that easy.

1843
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:35,080
你所寻找的就在你面前
What you seek lies in front of you.

1844
01:49:36,850 --> 01:49:39,050
你所害怕的也在那里
As does what you fear.

1845
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:45,760
宝石就在下面
The stone's down there.

1846
01:49:46,820 --> 01:49:48,010
只能给一个人
For one of you.

1847
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:50,390
而另一个
For the other...

1848
01:49:53,410 --> 01:49:55,370
要得到灵魂宝石
In order to take the stone...

1849
01:49:55,370 --> 01:49:57,980
你必须失去自己的珍爱之物
you must lose that which you love.

1850
01:49:59,830 --> 01:50:02,490
永恒的交换
An everlasting exchange.

1851
01:50:04,090 --> 01:50:07,490
以一个灵魂  换一个灵魂
A soul for a soul.

1852
01:50:10,760 --> 01:50:11,750
你好啊
How's it going?

1853
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:16,710
老天
Jesus.

1854
01:50:17,270 --> 01:50:19,300
这可能都是他编的
Maybe he's making this shit up.

1855
01:50:19,850 --> 01:50:20,760
不
No.

1856
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:23,170
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

1857
01:50:23,690 --> 01:50:25,470
为什么  就因为他知道你爸爸的名字吗
Why? 'Cause he knows your daddy's name?

1858
01:50:27,530 --> 01:50:28,550
连我都不知道
I didn't.

1859
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:31,720
灭霸带着灵魂宝石离开了这里
Thanos left here with the stone...

1860
01:50:32,950 --> 01:50:34,600
却没带走他女儿
without his daughter.

1861
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:36,440
那不是巧合
That's not a coincidence.

1862
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:38,860
的确
Yeah.

1863
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:42,780
不惜一切
Whatever it takes.

1864
01:50:47,670 --> 01:50:48,740
不惜一切
Whatever it takes.

1865
01:50:53,510 --> 01:50:55,000
如果我们拿不到宝石
If we don't get that stone...

1866
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:57,170
几十亿人就不能复生
billions of people stay dead.

1867
01:50:58,140 --> 01:50:58,880
是啊
Yeah.

1868
01:51:01,270 --> 01:51:03,130
我想我们都知道该牺牲的是谁了
Then I guess we both know who it's gotta be.

1869
01:51:04,070 --> 01:51:05,220
我想是的
I guess we do.

1870
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:14,980
我开始觉得
I'm starting to think

1871
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:17,980
我们想的不是一个人  娜塔莎
we mean different people here, Natasha.

1872
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:20,870
过去五年来  我一直在为一件事努力
For the last five years, I've been trying to do one thing.

1873
01:51:20,870 --> 01:51:21,980
就是此刻
Get to right here.

1874
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,170
一切都是为了此刻  让所有人复生
That's all it's been about. Bringing everybody back.

1875
01:51:24,170 --> 01:51:26,750
不  你别在这时候跟我装伟大
No, don't you get all decent on me now.

1876
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:28,320
怎么  你以为我想这么做吗
What, you think I wanna do it?

1877
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:31,170
我是在救你的命  傻瓜
I'm trying to save your life, you idiot.

1878
01:51:31,180 --> 01:51:33,330
可我不想让你救  行吗
Yeah, well, I don't want you to. How's that?

1879
01:51:34,550 --> 01:51:36,370
娜塔莎  你知道我都做了什么
Natasha, you know what I've done.

1880
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:39,920
你知道我已变成了什么样的人
You know what I've become.

1881
01:51:42,230 --> 01:51:44,880
我不会以一个人最糟糕的错误来评判他
I don't judge people on their worst mistakes.

1882
01:51:49,110 --> 01:51:50,220
或许你应该这样
Maybe you should.

1883
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:52,300
你当年就没有
You didn't.

1884
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:00,730
你真是太烦人了  你知道吗
You're a pain in my ass, you know that?

1885
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:12,990
好
Okay.

1886
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:16,200
你赢了
You win.

1887
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:24,500
跟我家人说我爱他们
Tell my family I love 'em.

1888
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:29,130
你自己告诉他们
You tell 'em yourself.

1889
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:03,420
该死的
Damn you.

1890
01:53:10,650 --> 01:53:11,470
等等
Wait.

1891
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:20,810
放手吧
Let me go.

1892
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:23,650
不
No.

1893
01:53:25,710 --> 01:53:26,730
不要啊
No. Please, no.

1894
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:31,070
没事的
It's okay.

1895
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:34,950
别
Please.

1896
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:37,660
不要
No!

1897
01:55:19,490 --> 01:55:20,600
我们都拿到了吗
Did we get 'em all?

1898
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:23,560
你是说真成功了吗
Are you telling me this actually worked?

1899
01:55:28,410 --> 01:55:29,610
克林特  小娜呢
Clint, where's Nat?

1900
01:55:58,990 --> 01:56:00,430
她有家人吗
Do we know if she had family?

1901
01:56:00,990 --> 01:56:01,800
有
Yeah.

1902
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:03,350
我们
Us.

1903
01:56:04,820 --> 01:56:05,520
什么
What?

1904
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:09,080
-你干什么  -就是问他个问题
- What are you doing? - Just asked him a question.

1905
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:10,450
不  你一副她已经死了的样子
Yeah, no, you're acting like she's dead.

1906
01:56:10,450 --> 01:56:11,540
我们为什么一副她已经死了的样子
Why are we acting like she's dead?

1907
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:12,980
我们有宝石啊
We have the stones, right?

1908
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:14,710
只要我们有宝石  队长
As long as we have the stones, Cap,

1909
01:56:14,710 --> 01:56:15,830
我们能复活她的  是吧
we can bring her back. Isn't that right?

1910
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:18,340
别垂头丧气的了  我们是复仇者  振作起来
So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers. Get it together.

1911
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:19,570
不能复活她
Can't get her back.

1912
01:56:22,510 --> 01:56:23,970
他说什么...什么
What's he...? What?

1913
01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:25,290
不能撤销
It can't be undone.

1914
01:56:25,930 --> 01:56:26,790
不能
It can't.

1915
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:31,390
对不起  别介意
Look, I'm sorry, no offense, but

1916
01:56:31,390 --> 01:56:33,180
但你就是个地球人  好吗
you're a very earthly being, okay?

1917
01:56:33,190 --> 01:56:34,770
这可是太空魔法
And we're talking about space magic.

1918
01:56:34,770 --> 01:56:36,780
"不能"也太绝对了  不是吗
And "can't" seems very definitive. Don't you think?

1919
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:39,820
我知道这远超我的水平
Yeah, look, I know that I'm way outside my pay grade here.

1920
01:56:39,820 --> 01:56:41,470
但她还是不在  是吧
But she still isn't here, is she?

1921
01:56:41,570 --> 01:56:42,690
我就是这意思
No, that's my point.

1922
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:45,350
是不能撤销的
It can't be undone.

1923
01:56:45,820 --> 01:56:46,740
至少
Or that's at least

1924
01:56:46,740 --> 01:56:49,200
那个飘着的红人是这么说的
what the red, floating guy had to say.

1925
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:50,870
或许你该去跟他谈谈
Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay?

1926
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:54,270
你去拿上锤子  飞过去  跟他谈谈
Go grab your hammer and you go fly and you talk to him.

1927
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:03,740
本该是我的
It was supposed to be me.

1928
01:57:06,890 --> 01:57:09,260
她为了那颗宝石牺牲了生命
She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone.

1929
01:57:09,260 --> 01:57:10,750
她赌上了性命
She bet her life on it.

1930
01:57:15,730 --> 01:57:17,340
她回不来了
She's not coming back.

1931
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:21,590
我们不能让她白死
We have to make it worth it.

1932
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:22,970
绝对不能
We have to.

1933
01:57:24,820 --> 01:57:25,680
不会的
We will.

1934
01:57:57,810 --> 01:57:59,300
好  手套准备好了
All right, the glove's ready.

1935
01:58:00,230 --> 01:58:02,840
问题是  谁来打指响
Question is, who's gonna snap their freakin' fingers?

1936
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:04,260
我来
I'll do it.

1937
01:58:04,690 --> 01:58:05,530
-什么  -没事
- Excuse me? - It's okay.

1938
01:58:05,530 --> 01:58:07,180
-不不  -打住  别急
- No, no, no. - Stop, stop. Slow down.

1939
01:58:07,570 --> 01:58:08,660
托尔  等等
Thor. Just wait.

1940
01:58:08,660 --> 01:58:10,720
我们还没决定由谁来戴
We haven't decided who's gonna put that on yet.

1941
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:12,870
不好意思  难道我们还要干坐着
I'm sorry. What, we're all just sitting around

1942
01:58:12,870 --> 01:58:14,330
等待合适时机吗
waiting for the right opportunity?

1943
01:58:14,330 --> 01:58:15,620
我们至少该谈谈
We should at least discuss it.

1944
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:17,460
坐在这里盯着它看
Look, sitting here staring at the thing

1945
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:19,320
是不会让大家复活的
is not gonna bring everybody back.

1946
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:21,880
我是最强的复仇者  好吗
I'm the strongest Avenger, okay?

1947
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:23,630
所以这责任该由我来担
So, this responsibility falls upon me.

1948
01:58:23,630 --> 01:58:24,840
-一般来说  你是对的  -这是我的责任
- Normally, you're right. - It's my duty.

1949
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:25,920
-但那不是重点  -不是那个
- It's not about that. - It's not that.

1950
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:28,660
-伙计  -住口  让我来吧
- Hey, buddy... - Stop it! Just let me.

1951
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:33,120
让我来吧
Just let me do it.

1952
01:58:33,510 --> 01:58:35,470
让我做件好事  做件对的事
Just let me do something good. Something right.

1953
01:58:35,470 --> 01:58:37,020
这不光是因为
Look, it's not just the fact that

1954
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:38,690
那只手套所承载的能量
that glove is channeling enough energy

1955
01:58:38,690 --> 01:58:39,600
足以点亮一个大陆
to light up a continent.

1956
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:41,730
相信我  你的状态不行
I'm telling you. You're in no condition.

1957
01:58:41,730 --> 01:58:45,070
你以为我现在血管里流的是什么
What do you think is coursing through my veins right now?

1958
01:58:45,070 --> 01:58:46,130
奶酪吗
Cheez Whiz?

1959
01:58:48,780 --> 01:58:49,530
雷电
Lightning.

1960
01:58:49,530 --> 01:58:50,860
-是啊  -雷电
- Yeah. - Lightning.

1961
01:58:50,870 --> 01:58:52,560
雷电也帮不了你  伙计
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1962
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:53,930
得由我来
It's gotta be me.

1963
01:58:55,700 --> 01:58:58,020
你们看到宝石对灭霸的伤害了
You saw what those stones did to Thanos.

1964
01:58:58,080 --> 01:58:59,360
他差点没命
They almost killed him.

1965
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:03,110
你们都撑不住的
None of you could survive.

1966
01:59:03,590 --> 01:59:04,990
我们怎么知道你撑得住
How do we know you will?

1967
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:06,530
我们不知道
We don't.

1968
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:09,120
但辐射主要就是伽马射线
But the radiation's mostly gamma.

1969
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:14,160
就好像
It's like...

1970
01:59:16,350 --> 01:59:17,960
我是为此而诞生的
I was made for this.

1971
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:38,560
可以了吗
Good to go, yeah?

1972
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:41,770
开始吧
Let's do it.

1973
01:59:42,210 --> 01:59:43,120
好  记住
Okay, remember,

1974
01:59:43,130 --> 01:59:44,920
五年前被灭霸的指响打没的人
everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago

1975
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:47,320
你把他们带回来  回到现在  今天来
you're just bringing them back to now, today.

1976
01:59:47,710 --> 01:59:49,740
别改变过去五年里的任何事
Don't change anything from the last five years.

1977
01:59:50,420 --> 01:59:51,450
好的
Got it.

他们毫未怀疑
They suspected nothing.

2017

去
Go.

2019

找到宝石  拿给我

2023
02:06:09,890 --> 02:06:11,200
在未来
In the future...

2024
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:14,210
你和我怎么样了
what happens to you and me?

2025
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:18,040
我企图杀你
I try to kill you.

2026
02:06:20,060 --> 02:06:21,420
好几次
Several times.

2027
02:06:22,650 --> 02:06:23,800
但最终
But eventually...

2028
02:06:24,740 --> 02:06:25,970
我们成了朋友
we become friends.

2029
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:29,720
我们成了姐妹
We become sisters.

2030
02:06:37,540 --> 02:06:38,480
来吧
Come on.

2031
02:06:40,750 --> 02:06:41,990
我们可以阻止他

2032
02:06:50,840 --> 02:06:51,910
拜托  伙计  醒醒
Come on, buddy, wake up!

2033
02:06:52,510 --> 02:06:53,580
这就对了
That's my man.

2034
02:06:54,970 --> 02:06:57,420
你再弄丢  我可就不还你了
You lose this again, I'm keeping it.

2035
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:01,590
怎么回事
What happened?

2036
02:07:01,900 --> 02:07:03,920
你扰乱时间  时间就给你捣乱
You mess with time, it tends to mess back.

2037
02:07:04,110 --> 02:07:05,090
你会明白的
You'll see.

2038
02:07:27,170 --> 02:07:28,240
他都干什么了
What's he been doing?

2039
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:31,700
什么都没干
Absolutely nothing.

2040
02:07:33,550 --> 02:07:35,080
宝石呢
Where are the stones?

2041
02:07:35,720 --> 02:07:37,370
在这堆东西下面
Somewhere under all this.

2042
02:07:39,020 --> 02:07:40,630
我只知道他没拿到
All I know is he doesn't have 'em.

2043
02:07:41,480 --> 02:07:42,980
那就别让他拿到
So, we keep it that way.

2044
02:07:42,980 --> 02:07:44,710
你们知道这是陷阱吧
You know it's a trap, right?

2045
02:07:44,900 --> 02:07:45,840
知道
Yeah.

2046
02:07:46,230 --> 02:07:47,510
我不怎么在乎
I don't much care.

2047
02:07:48,490 --> 02:07:49,260
很好
Good.

2048
02:07:50,490 --> 02:07:53,010
只要我们都达成一致就行
Just as long as we're all in agreement.

2049
02:08:02,870 --> 02:08:04,690
我们这次要好好杀了他
Let's kill him properly this time.

2050
02:08:14,090 --> 02:08:16,700
你们无法承受自己的失败
You could not live with your own failure.

2051
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:19,920
结果如何呢
Where did that bring you?

2052
02:08:23,310 --> 02:08:24,340
又跟我碰面了
Back to me.

2053
02:08:28,650 --> 02:08:31,300
我本以为抹除了一半的生命
I thought by eliminating half of life...

2054
02:08:32,030 --> 02:08:34,180
另一半就能兴旺
the other half would thrive.

2055
02:08:34,870 --> 02:08:36,310
但你们让我知道
But you've shown me...

2056
02:08:37,330 --> 02:08:38,850
那是不可能的
that's impossible.

2057
02:08:40,950 --> 02:08:44,190
只要还有人记得曾经
And as long as there are those that remember what was...

2058
02:08:44,290 --> 02:08:45,790
就总会有人
there will always be those

2059
02:08:45,790 --> 02:08:49,400
无法接受可能的未来
that are unable to accept what can be.

2060
02:08:50,420 --> 02:08:51,780
他们会抵抗
They will resist.

2061
02:08:52,050 --> 02:08:53,950
对  我们就那么固执
Yep, we're all kinds of stubborn.

2062
02:08:54,930 --> 02:08:56,200
我很感激
I'm thankful.

2063
02:08:58,600 --> 02:08:59,960
因为现在
Because now...

2064
02:09:00,680 --> 02:09:02,380
我知道我该怎么办了
I know what I must do.

2065
02:09:03,270 --> 02:09:08,300
我要粉碎全宇宙  化为原子
I will shred this universe down to its last atom.

2066
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:10,470
然后
And then...

2067
02:09:11,110 --> 02:09:13,600
再用你们替我收集的宝石
with the stones you've collected for me...

2068
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:15,640
创造个新宇宙
create a new one...

2069
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:18,140
充满生机
teeming with life...

2070
02:09:18,830 --> 02:09:20,660
它不会知道自己失去了什么
that knows not what it has lost...

2071
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:22,770
只知道它被赋予了什么
but only what it has been given.

2072
02:09:26,330 --> 02:09:28,110
一个感恩的宇宙
A grateful universe.

2073
02:09:28,340 --> 02:09:29,790
从鲜血中诞生
Born out of blood.

2074
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:31,200
他们不会知道的
They'll never know it.

2075
02:09:32,510 --> 02:09:34,990
因为你们活不到那时告诉他们
Because you won't be alive to tell them.

2076
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:51,930
另一边见了  伙计
See you on the other side, man.

2077
02:09:53,990 --> 02:09:55,850
撑着  我来了
Hang on! I'm coming!

2078
02:10:26,170 --> 02:10:27,060
好啊
Yeah!

2079
02:10:43,650 --> 02:10:44,620
我认识你
I know you.

2080
02:10:48,420 --> 02:10:49,300
父亲
Father...

2081
02:10:50,150 --> 02:10:51,380
我拿到宝石了
I have the stones.

2082
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:52,440
什么
What?

2083
02:10:53,980 --> 02:10:54,920
住手
Stop.

2084
02:11:00,170 --> 02:11:01,420
你要背叛我们
You're betraying us?

2085
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:08,930
你不用这么做的
You don't have to do this.

2086
02:11:11,590 --> 02:11:14,250
我就是这样
I am this.

2087
02:11:14,350 --> 02:11:16,200
不  你不是
No, you're not.

2088
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:18,110
你看到我们变成什么样了
You've seen what we become.

2089
02:11:24,640 --> 02:11:26,130
星云  听她的
Nebula, listen to her.

2090
02:11:28,460 --> 02:11:29,520
你可以改变的
You can change.

2091

他不会允许的
He won't let me.

2092
02:11:39,130 --> 02:11:40,070
不要
No!

2093

好  托尔  来吧
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

2094
02:12:17,450 --> 02:12:18,570
老板  醒醒
Boss, wake up!

2095
02:13:10,060 --> 02:13:11,050
我就知道
I knew it!

2096
02:14:33,950 --> 02:14:35,950
我南征北战这么多年
In all my years of conquest...

2097
02:14:37,790 --> 02:14:38,820
暴力
violence...

2098
02:14:40,660 --> 02:14:41,690
屠戮
slaughter...

2099
02:14:43,700 --> 02:14:45,040
从来不是出于私怨
it was never personal.

2100
02:14:48,860 --> 02:14:50,120
但告诉你们
But I'll tell you now...

2101
02:14:52,940 --> 02:14:55,530
我马上要对你们顽固讨厌的
what I'm about to do to your stubborn,

2102
02:14:56,440 --> 02:14:58,180
小星球做的事
annoying little planet...

2103
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:02,010
我会非常
I'm gonna enjoy it...

2104
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:05,250
享受其中的
very, very much.

2105
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:11,080
队长  收到吗
Hey, Cap, you read me?

2106
02:16:17,330 --> 02:16:18,980
队长  我是山姆  收到吗
Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me?

2107
02:16:23,670 --> 02:16:24,710
在你左边
On your left.

2108
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:51,800
就这些人了吗
Is that everyone?

2109
02:17:52,260 --> 02:17:53,540
什么  你还嫌不够吗
What? You wanted more?

2110
02:18:20,930 --> 02:18:22,160
复仇者
Avengers...

2111
02:18:27,860 --> 02:18:28,810
集结
assemble.

2112
02:19:04,140 --> 02:19:05,220
死吧
Die!

2113
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:27,320
不  那个给我
No, no, give me that.

2114
02:19:27,440 --> 02:19:28,540
你拿那个小的
You have the little one.

2115
02:19:44,610 --> 02:19:45,590
我去
Holy cow!

2116
02:19:45,590 --> 02:19:46,840
你不会相信都发生了什么的
You will not believe what's been going on.

2117
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:48,480
还记得我们在太空里时吗
Do you remember when we were in space?

2118
02:19:48,620 --> 02:19:49,870
我化成灰了
And I got all dusty?

2119
02:19:49,870 --> 02:19:50,880
我肯定是昏了过去
And I must've passed out,

2120
02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:52,460
因为我醒来时  你不在了
because I woke up and you were gone.

2121
02:19:52,460 --> 02:19:54,450
但斯特兰奇博士在  他说
But Doctor Strange was there, right? And he was like...

2122
02:19:54,450 --> 02:19:56,040
"已经过去五年了  快走  他们需要我们"
"It's been five years. Come on, they need us."

2123
02:19:56,040 --> 02:19:57,740
然后他就开始画那个亮亮的黄圈
And then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing

2124
02:19:57,740 --> 02:19:59,000
-就他老做的那个  -是吗
- that he does all the time. - He did? Oh, no.

2125
02:19:59,000 --> 02:19:59,940
你干什么
What are you doing?

2126
02:20:05,440 --> 02:20:06,450
感觉好棒
Oh, this is nice.

2127
02:20:28,940 --> 02:20:29,840
卡魔拉
Gamora?

2128
02:20:39,230 --> 02:20:40,330
我以为我失去了你
I thought I lost you.

2129
02:20:45,420 --> 02:20:47,880
别  碰  我
Don't touch me!

2130
02:20:51,350 --> 02:20:52,650
你第一次没打中
You missed the first time.

2131
02:20:53,400 --> 02:20:55,470
然后第二次你一下踢中了俩
Then you got 'em both the second time.

2132
02:20:57,480 --> 02:20:58,460
就是他吗
This is the one?

2133
02:20:58,540 --> 02:20:59,580
不是吧
Seriously?

2134
02:20:59,850 --> 02:21:02,070
你只能在他和一棵树之间选择
Your choices were him or a tree.

2135
02:21:12,740 --> 02:21:13,610
队长
Cap!

2136
02:21:13,780 --> 02:21:15,410
你要我怎么处理这玩意啊
What do you want me to do with this damn thing?

2137
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:20,230
把那些宝石拿得越远越好
Get those stones as far away as possible!

2138
02:21:20,400 --> 02:21:21,310
不
No!

2139
02:21:22,620 --> 02:21:24,800
我们还得把它们送回原处
We need to get 'em back where they came from.

2140
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:25,590
没法送回去了
No way to get 'em back.

2141
02:21:25,590 --> 02:21:27,230
灭霸毁了量子隧道
Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.

2142
02:21:27,450 --> 02:21:28,370
等等
Hold on!

2143
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:31,900
那不是唯一的时间机器
That wasn't our only time machine.

2144
02:21:38,350 --> 02:21:40,420
有人看到一辆丑爆了的棕色货车了吗
Anyone see an ugly brown van out there?

2145
02:21:40,790 --> 02:21:41,690
看到了
Yes!

2146
02:21:41,800 --> 02:21:43,690
但你不会喜欢它停车的地方的
But you're not gonna like where it's parked!

2147
02:21:43,820 --> 02:21:46,290
斯科特  你启动它需要多久
Scott, how long you need to get that thing working?

2148
02:21:47,540 --> 02:21:48,560
大概10分钟
Maybe 10 minutes.

2149
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:50,360
去启动机器  我们把宝石送去给你
Get it started. We'll get the stones to you.

2150
02:21:50,400 --> 02:21:51,410
好的  队长
We're on it, Cap.

2151
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:05,170
你说是一千四百万之一的概率能赢  是吧
You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah?

2152
02:22:07,090 --> 02:22:08,150
就是这次吧
Tell me this is it.

2153
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:09,860
如果我告诉你会发生什么
If I tell you what happens...

2154
02:22:10,550 --> 02:22:11,590
就不会发生了
it won't happen.

2155
02:22:15,430 --> 02:22:16,400
你最好是对的
You better be right.

2156
02:22:24,750 --> 02:22:26,070
后面好乱
It's a mess back here.

2157
02:22:27,490 --> 02:22:28,490
没反应
It's dead.

2158
02:22:29,130 --> 02:22:30,390
-什么  -没反应
- What? - It's dead.

2159
02:22:30,970 --> 02:22:32,170
我得热启动试试
I have to hot-wire it.

2160
02:22:35,370 --> 02:22:36,450
星云呢
Where's Nebula?

2161
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:39,000
她没回应
She's not responding.

2162
02:22:39,460 --> 02:22:40,430
大人
Sire...

2163
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:51,370
克林特
Clint!

2164
02:22:53,930 --> 02:22:55,000
给我
Give it to me.

2165
02:23:17,240 --> 02:23:20,530
你夺走了我的一切
You took everything from me.

2166
02:23:20,940 --> 02:23:22,840
我都不知道你是谁
I don't even know who you are.

2167
02:23:23,570 --> 02:23:24,540
你会知道的
You will.

2168
02:23:47,370 --> 02:23:48,340
交给我
I got it!

2169
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:52,590
启动击杀功能
Activate Instant Kill.

2170
02:24:15,740 --> 02:24:17,040
全力轰炸
Rain fire!

2171
02:24:17,660 --> 02:24:19,680
但大人  我们的部队
But, sire, our troops!

2172
02:24:19,700 --> 02:24:21,120
照办
Just do it!

2173
02:24:42,350 --> 02:24:43,710
有人看到了吗
Is anyone else seeing this?

2174
02:24:57,930 --> 02:24:58,890
我行的
I got this!

2175
02:24:59,180 --> 02:25:00,110
我行的
I got this.

2176
02:25:00,110 --> 02:25:01,310
好吧  我不行了
Okay, I don't got this.

2177
02:25:01,450 --> 02:25:02,670
救命  谁救救我
Help, somebody help!

2178
02:25:02,670 --> 02:25:04,680
皇后区  看上面
Hey, Queens, heads up!

2179
02:25:14,610 --> 02:25:16,160

Hang on. I got you, kid.

认识你很高兴
Nice to meet you...

2181
02:25:20,580 --> 02:25:21,900
老天爷啊
Oh, my God!

2182
02:25:58,980 --> 02:26:00,130
怎么回事
What the hell is this?

2183
02:26:01,070 --> 02:26:02,140
星期五  他们在冲什么开火
Friday, what are they firing at?

2184
02:26:02,140 --> 02:26:04,190
有什么刚进入了上层大气
Something just entered the upper atmosphere.

2185
02:26:18,280 --> 02:26:19,390
好样的
Oh, yeah!

2186
02:26:39,610 --> 02:26:41,990
丹弗斯  我们这里需要帮助
Danvers, we need an assist here.

2187
02:26:51,020 --> 02:26:53,210
我是彼得·帕克

2188
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:55,080
彼得·帕克
Hey, Peter Parker.

你有什么要给我吗
You got something for me?

2190
02:27:02,870 --> 02:27:04,670
我不知道你要怎么通过那一关
I don't know how you're gonna get it through all of that.

2191
02:27:06,490 --> 02:27:07,500
别担心
Don't worry.

2192
02:27:08,790 --> 02:27:09,980
她不是一个人
She's got help.

2193
02:29:58,230 --> 02:30:00,940
我是宿命
I am inevitable.

2194
02:30:21,950 --> 02:30:23,180
我
And I...

2195
02:30:25,110 --> 02:30:26,060
是
am...

2196
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:31,040
钢铁侠
Iron Man.

2197
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:31,110
斯塔克先生
Mr. Stark?

2198
02:32:34,570 --> 02:32:36,600
斯塔克先生  你能听到我吗
Mr. Stark. Can you hear me?

2199
02:32:37,750 --> 02:32:38,710
我是彼得
It's Peter.

2200
02:32:43,180 --> 02:32:45,510
我们赢了  斯塔克先生
We won, Mr. Stark.

2201
02:32:48,010 --> 02:32:49,320
我们赢了  斯塔克先生
We won, Mr. Stark.

2202
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:53,780
我们赢了  你做到了  先生  你做到了
We won! You did it, sir, you did it.

2203
02:32:55,760 --> 02:32:56,760
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

2204
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:57,960
托尼
Tony.

2205
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:13,930
小派
Hey, Pep.

2206
02:33:19,020 --> 02:33:19,960
星期五
Friday?

2207
02:33:20,340 --> 02:33:21,960
生命机能情况危急
Life functions critical.

2208
02:33:31,660 --> 02:33:32,550
托尼
Tony?

2209
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:34,980
看着我
Look at me.

2210
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:38,880
我们会没事的
We're gonna be okay.

2211
02:33:44,290 --> 02:33:45,430
你可以休息了
You can rest now.

2212
02:35:31,610 --> 02:35:33,950
大家都想要一个快乐的结局  对吗
Everybody wants a happy ending, right?

2213
02:35:34,650 --> 02:35:36,410
但世事难料
But it doesn't always roll that way.

2214
02:35:38,960 --> 02:35:40,050
也许这次的结局会是快乐的
Maybe this time.

2215
02:35:42,110 --> 02:35:44,300
我希望你们回放这个的时候
I'm hoping if you play this back...

2216
02:35:46,470 --> 02:35:47,770
是在庆祝
it's in celebration.

2217
02:35:49,050 --> 02:35:52,960
我希望家人能够团圆  我希望我们能挽回
I hope families are reunited. I hope we get it back.

2218
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:54,310
这个星球能够回归
And something like a normal version

2219
02:35:54,310 --> 02:35:55,890
还算正常的版本
of the planet has been restored.

2220
02:35:56,830 --> 02:35:58,910
如果真有这种东西的话
If there ever was such a thing.

2221
02:35:59,550 --> 02:36:02,540
天呐  世界真奇妙  宇宙真奇妙
God, what a world. Universe, now.

2222
02:36:03,470 --> 02:36:05,550
如果你十年前跟我说我们并不孤单
If you told me 10 years ago that we weren't alone...

2223
02:36:05,560 --> 02:36:07,840
而且还热闹到这种程度
let alone to this extent, I mean,

2224
02:36:07,840 --> 02:36:09,280
我倒不会觉得惊讶
I wouldn't have been surprised...

2225
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:10,790
但谁能想到呢
but come on, who knew?

2226
02:36:11,270 --> 02:36:14,200
轮番登场的史诗般的
The epic forces of darkness and light

2227
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:15,460
黑暗和光明势力
that have come into play.

2228
02:36:16,090 --> 02:36:17,560
不管是好是坏
And for better or worse...

2229
02:36:17,970 --> 02:36:19,570
这就是将伴随摩根
that's the reality Morgan's gonna

2230
02:36:19,570 --> 02:36:21,220
成长的现实
have to find a way to grow up in.

2231
02:36:25,530 --> 02:36:27,890
所以  我觉得最好录下一段问候
So, I thought I'd probably better record a little greeting,

2232
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:31,030
以防我英年早逝了
in the case of an untimely death. On my part.

2233
02:36:31,550 --> 02:36:34,210
虽然死亡总是来得太早
Not that death at any time isn't untimely.

2234
02:36:35,550 --> 02:36:37,910
我们明天要尝试的时间旅行
This time travel thing that we're gonna try and pull off tomorrow

2235
02:36:37,910 --> 02:36:41,400
真的很难说我们能不能活下来
it's got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all.

2236
02:36:41,400 --> 02:36:42,450
就是这样
That's the thing.

2237
02:36:44,690 --> 02:36:46,640
但是  做英雄就是如此  不是吗
Then again, that's the hero gig, right?

2238
02:36:46,640 --> 02:36:48,030
结束也是旅程的一部分
Part of the journey is the end.

2239
02:36:49,710 --> 02:36:50,780
我在耍什么疯
What am I even tripping for?

2240
02:36:50,790 --> 02:36:51,870
一切都会
Everything is gonna work out

2241
02:36:51,870 --> 02:36:54,910
如愿以偿的
exactly the way it's supposed to.

2242
02:36:58,610 --> 02:36:59,950
我爱你三千
I love you 3,000.

2243
02:37:20,450 --> 02:37:28,040
{\an8}托尼·斯塔克有心的证明

2244
02:39:15,090 --> 02:39:16,510
我希望有什么办法

我该成为真正的自己
It's time for me to be who I am rather than

2268
02:40:58,500 --> 02:40:59,930

I have no path.

2278
02:41:31,540 --> 02:41:32,820
但我有便车可以搭
I do have a ride though.

2279

动作快点  大毛球
Move it or lose it, hairbag.

2280

2284
02:41:51,380 --> 02:41:52,560

2285
02:41:56,190 --> 02:41:58,400
提醒你一下  这还是我的飞船
Just so you know, this is my ship still.

2286
02:41:58,400 --> 02:41:59,380

你说"当然了"  但你又碰地图了
See, you say, "of course," but then you touch the map.

2290
02:42:09,320 --> 02:42:10,040
这会让人觉得
It makes you think that

2291
02:42:10,040 --> 02:42:12,110
也许你并不明白是我说了算
maybe you didn't realize I was in charge.

2292
02:42:12,310 --> 02:42:15,120
-葵尔  这只是你的不安全感  -葵尔

我只是想帮忙和协助

2295
02:42:19,040 --> 02:42:20,050
我就是这么说的
That's what I said.

2296
02:42:20,060 --> 02:42:22,490
你们应该为领袖地位的荣耀一战较高下
You should fight one another for the honor of leadership.

2297
02:42:22,540 --> 02:42:23,620
这样公平

2298
02:42:26,590 --> 02:42:28,950
-没必要吧  -没必要

2305

我们不该以刀相见

你得把宝石还回它们被拿走的那一刻
you have to return the stones to the exact moment you got 'em

2315
02:43:09,780 --> 02:43:12,580
否则就会开启一堆讨厌的平行现实
or you're gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities.

2316
02:43:13,210 --> 02:43:14,310
别担心  布鲁斯

This one's on me, though.

2326

不知道  他错过了他的时间戳

山姆
Hi, Sam.

2354
02:45:56,810 --> 02:45:59,620
是出了差错  还是一切如愿
So, did something go wrong or did something go right?

2355
02:46:01,970 --> 02:46:05,180
我把宝石放回去后  我想着
Well, after I put the stones back, I thought...

2356
02:46:06,930 --> 02:46:07,870
要不

2357

就是我不得不生活在一个
is the fact I have to live in a world

所以它是你的了
That's why it's yours.

2374
02:47:53,140 --> 02:47:54,540

2375
02:48:00,990 --> 02:48:01,920
不
No.

2376

这两件事毫不相关
The two events were not related.

22
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,250
跟我说说这个梦
Tell me about this dream.

23
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,280
-有什么新内容吗  -没有
- Anything new? - No.

24
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,710
你必须放下过去
You have to let go of the past.

25
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,000
我不记得我的过去了
I don't remember my past.

26
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,460
这让你产生怀疑
It's causing you doubt,

27
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,590
怀疑让你有弱点
and doubt makes you vulnerable.

28
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,860
控制住
Control it.

29
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,520
如果你再次失控
Lose control again,

30
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,000
就得去找至高智慧密谈了
and you'll have to commune with the Supreme Intelligence.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,080
对于战士而言  情绪是最危险的
There's nothing more dangerous to a warrior than emotion.

32
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,520
幽默使人分心
Humor is a distraction.

33
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,790
而愤怒
And anger?

34
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,790
愤怒只会帮助你的敌人
Anger only serves the enemy.

35
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,240
距最后一次斯库鲁侵袭已过去了120天
One hundred twenty days since the last Skrull attack.

36
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,820
有人见过
Has anyone ever seen

37
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,900
至高智慧的真面目吗
what the Supreme Intelligence really looks like?

38
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,090
没人能看到至高智慧的真面目
No one can look upon the Supreme Intelligence in its true form.

39
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,970
你知道的
You know that.

40
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,700
我们的潜意识会选择我们所能看到的形象
Our subconscious chooses the way they appear to us.

41
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,120
因此它是神圣的
So it's sacred.

42
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,050
也是私密的
It's personal.

43
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,230
克里人绝对不会泄露这个秘密
No Kree divulges it, ever.

44
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,740
你会看到谁
Who do you see?

45
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,520
-你哥哥吗  -不是
- Your brother? - No.

你看到的是我  对吧
It's me you see, isn't it?

49
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,230
我知道你想干什么
I see what you're trying to do.

50
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,110
-这招有用吗  -有用
- Is it working? - Yes.

51
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,920
但你别想转移话题
But you won't succeed in changing the subject.

52
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,390
如果你不希望我使用这力量
What is the point of giving me these...

53
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,020
那还何必把它给我
if you don't want me to use them?

54
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,410
我希望你使用这力量
I want you to use them.

55
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,700
至高智慧让我负责
The Supreme Intelligence gave me a responsibility...

教会你如何使用这力量

57
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,900
我知道怎么用
I know how.

58
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,710
如果你真会用
Yeah, if that were true,

59
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,360
就能不用它也可以打倒我了
you'd be able to knock me down without them.

60
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,600
控制你的冲动
Control your impulses.

61
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,360
不要用这儿  而是用这儿
Stop using this, start using this.

肯定又是斯库鲁侵袭

-让我深感不安  -为什么

我现在并没笑
I'm not doing that now.

108
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,870
说来好笑  因为客观来讲

Vers? Skrulls.

177
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,260
是埋伏
It's an ambush.

178
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,520
敌舰
Incoming!

179
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,380
回氦核飞船去
Back to the Helion.

180
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,360
弗斯  收到吗
Vers. Do you copy?

181
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,270
回氦核飞船去
Back to the Helion.

182
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,650
回复  弗斯
Come in. Vers.

183
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,110
你怎么会知道密码
How did you know the code?

184
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,660
我可以告诉你我的秘密
How about I tell you my secret...

185
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,130
但你先说你的
when you've told me yours?

186
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,760
敞开她吧
Let's open her up.

187
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,980
我们在哪
Where are we?

188
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,140
就绪
Stand by.

189
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,700
你想什么呢[脑袋在哪]
Where's your head at?

190
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,940
想云彩[胡思乱想]  你呢
In the clouds. Where's yours?

191
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,350
在我肩膀上
On my shoulders.

192
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,390
要让这些男的见识一下我们的本事
About to show these boys how we do it.

193
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,380
你准备好了吗
You ready?

194
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,540
更高  更远  更快啊  亲爱的
Higher, further, faster, baby.

195
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,710
没错
That's right.

196
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,100
这不对
This can't be right.

197
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,220
再往前倒
Go back even further.

198
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,490
你开太快了  你得慢点
You're going too fast! You need to go slow!

199
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,230
这人是谁  我们找对...
Who is this person? Are we in the right...?

200
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,590
你怎么想的
What the hell are you thinking?

201
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,540
你不该来这里
You don't belong out here!

202
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,100
我们好像倒得太多了
I think we went back too far.

203
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,550
你让他开了
You let him drive.

204
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,930
我试试吧
Let me try something.

205
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,820
放弃吧
Give up already!

206
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,690
你不该来这里
You don't belong out here!

207
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,110
你不够强壮
You're not strong enough.

208
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,780
你会害死自己的
You'll kill yourself.

209
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,780
他们绝不会让你飞的
They'll never let you fly.

210
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,820
只有我一个人看糊涂了吗
Am I the only one that's confused here?

211
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,410
你是个好飞行员
You're a decent pilot.

212
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,090
但你太情绪化
But you're too emotional.

213
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,160
你知道那为什么叫驾驶舱[屌坑]吧
You do know why they call it a cockpit, don't you?

214
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,490
一声贯穿宇宙的巨响  震动了月亮
A huge rumble throughout the cosmos shook the moon...

215
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,880
太阳  和天上的星星
and the sun and the stars in the sky.

216
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,590
于是
And so,

217
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,070
小阿露蒂整夜飞上天空
little Alouette flew up throughout the night.

218
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,650
你看到她了吗  那是小阿露蒂
Did you see her? It's Alouette.

219
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,010
给我进来  该吃饭了
Get your butts inside, it's time to eat.

220
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,460
准备起飞  捣蛋中尉
Prepare for takeoff, Lieutenant Trouble.

221
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,820
有趣的记忆
Charming memory.

222
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,980
等等
Hang on.

223
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,710
我好像找到了
I think I've got it.

224
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,550
咕咕喜欢你
Goose likes you.

225
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,210
她一般不怎么亲近人的
She doesn't typically take to people.

226
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,660
你起得好早
Early start to your morning.

227
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,880
其实是晚上熬夜了
Late night, actually.

228
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,840
还有工作  我就睡不着
I can't sleep when there's work to do.

229
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,900
耳熟吗
Sound familiar?

230
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,080
我从不觉得飞行是工作
Flying your planes never feels like work.

231
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,830
风景很棒  是吧
Wonderful view, isn't it?

232
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,620
我更喜欢上面的风景
I prefer the view from up there.

233
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,090
你很快就能上去了  王牌
You'll get there soon enough, Ace.

234
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,450
等等  就是她  倒回去
Wait! Wait, wait! That's her. Get her back.

235
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,550
就绪
Stand by.

236
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,960

239
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,760
你很快就能上去了  王牌
You'll get there soon enough, Ace.

240
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,830
她衣服上写着什么
What's that on her shirt?

241
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,200
我看不清
I couldn't read it.

242
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,700
风景很棒  是吧
Wonderful view, isn't it?

243
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,180
我更喜欢上面的风景
I prefer the view from up there.

244
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,600
-你很快就能上去了  王牌  -集中精神
- You'll get there soon enough, Ace. - Focus.

245
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,170
什么
Excuse me?

246
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,730
-你很快就能上去了  王牌  -往下看
- You'll get there soon enough, Ace. - Look down.

247
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,300
集中精神
Focus.

248
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,930
"飞马计划  温迪·劳森博士"  就是她
"Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson." That's her.

249
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,810
你也能听到吗
Do you hear that, too?

250
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,420
定位了吗
Do we have her location?

251
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,640
找到了
Got it.

252
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,160
追踪劳森  直到找到能量信号
Now track Lawson until we find the energy signature.

253
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,700
有趣
Interesting.

254
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,750
等等
Hold on.

255
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,220
倒回到这之前  回去
Go back right before this. Go back.

256
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,440
那可不是米格  劳森
That's no MiG, Lawson.

257
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,750
就是这个  让我看看你要去哪
This is it. Now let me see where you're headed.

258
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,430
没错  看看坐标
That's right. Look at the coordinates.

259
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,730
集中精神
Focus.

260
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,740
请敞开头脑
Open, please.

261
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,630
就这样  就这样
That's it. That's it.

262
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,710
快看到了
You're almost there.

263
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,810
快看到了  别抵抗
You're almost there. Don't fight it.

264
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,640
集中精神
Focus!

265
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,790
把她拉回来  快点
Get her back! Get her back now!

266
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,450
这没道理
This doesn't make any sense.

267
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,880
我们拿到任何可以行动的情报了吗
Do we have any information we can act on?

268
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,970
只知道劳森在C53星球上某处
Just that Lawson was somewhere on planet C-53.

269
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,250
我们这就去
We're on our way.

270
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,570
那就再继续深挖
Then dig, dig, dig deeper.

271
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,060
劳森能带我们找到光速引擎
Lawson is our link to that light-speed engine!

272
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,550
和我们想要的一切
And everything we're after.

273
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,910
刚刚那下有用
That did something.

274
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,410
再来
Try that again.

275
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,340
不行
Not yet!

276
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,070
你对我做了什么
What did you do to me?

277
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,610
我们只是想要点情报
Now we're just after a little information.

278
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,300
你往我脑袋里放了什么
What did you put in my head?

279
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,120
那都是本就存在的  永久域名CCTV12306.COM
Nothing that wasn't already there.

280
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,330
但那些不是我的记忆
But those aren't my memories.

281
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,930
是啊  就像嗑错了药  是吧
Yeah, it's like a bad trip, isn't it?

282
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,670
怪不得你稀里糊涂的
I'm not surprised you can't keep it straight.

283
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,510
他们真把你祸害得不轻
They really did a number on you.

284
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,760
少跟我玩心理战
Enough of your mind games.

285
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,570
你想要什么
What do you want?

286
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,980
我们在找一位劳森博士
We're looking for the location of a Dr. Lawson...

287
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,700
和她的光速引擎
and her light-speed engine.

288
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,360
我不认识什么劳森博士
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

289
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:48,720
是吗  那她为什么在你脑袋里
Really? Then why is she in your head?

290
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,950
你们不会刚好知道
You guys wouldn't happen to know

291
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,670
这玩意怎么拿下来吧
how these things come off, would ya?

292
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:23,960
不吗
No?

293
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,930
好吧
Fine.

294
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,050
你知道那为什么叫...
You do know why they call it a...

295
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,280
这就走了
You leaving so soon?

296
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,900
我们才刚认识
We're just getting to know each other.

这里是C53吗
Is this C-53?

305
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,550
你听懂了吗  我的宇宙翻译器好使吧
Do you understand me? Is my universal translator working?

306
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,000
嗯  我听懂了
Yeah. I understand you.

307
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,130

你负责这一带的安全吗
Are you in charge of security for this district?

309
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,900
算是吧  影院有自己的保安

追踪飞行舱  找到那姑娘
Track the pod. Find the girl.

314
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,750
她知道的情报比自己以为的多

315
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,950
这个我要了
This one's taken.

大家还好吗  发生了什么
Is everyone okay? What happened?

323
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,170
斯库鲁伏击
Skrull ambush.

324
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,000
我以为我们失去你了
I thought we'd lost you.

325
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,310
你找到索拉了吗
Did you find Soh-Larr?

326
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,620
那根本不是索拉
It wasn't Soh-Larr.

327
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,100
是塔罗斯模仿了他  连他的密码都知道
Talos simmed him. Even knew his code.

328
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,540
那不可能
That's impossible.

329
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,350
那密码是在他的潜意识里的
That code was buried in his unconscious.

330
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,710
斯库鲁人动了我的大脑
The Skrulls messed with my mind.

331
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,570
他们用的那台机器
The machine that they used...

332
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,400
我觉得他们就是那样得知了索拉的密码
I think it's how they extracted Soh-Larr's code.

他们觉得她研发出了光速科技

343
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,880
我得赶在他们之前找到她
I have to get to her before they do...

344
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,910
否则他们就能入侵新星系了

不  你已经被抓到一次了

C53离我们多远

离最近的跳跃点有22小时的路程

349
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,110
保持通讯器在线  以便我们联系你
Keep your comms online so we can contact you.

350
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,010

351
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,030

358
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,390
如果斯库鲁人控制了她的心智
If the Skrulls got to her,

359
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,900
她就不能被信任了
she's compromised.

360
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,670
她比你想的要坚强
She's stronger than you think.

361
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,520

破地方

打扰  小姐
Excuse me, miss.

368
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,430
你知道有位女士把那边的
You know anything about a lady blowing a hole

369
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,150
百视达屋顶轰了个洞吗
through the roof of that Blockbuster over there?

370
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,450
证人说她穿了一身激光枪战的衣服

371

我想问你些问题
I'd like to ask you some questions.

或许教教你怎么用深夜投件箱

弗斯  克里星际战队

376
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,770
我们不把身份证明写在小纸片上
We don't carry our identification on little cards.

377
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,880
弗斯

378
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,310

380
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,340
等我找到
I'll be out of your hair...

381
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,520
正在潜入你们星球的斯库鲁人
as soon as I track down the Skrulls

382
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,470
我就会离开了
that are infiltrating your planet.

383
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,750
斯库鲁人
Skrulls?

384
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,560
变形者
Shapeshifters?

385
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,610
他们能变形成任何生命形式  连DNA也能复制
They can transform into any life-form down to the DNA.

386
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,300
天呐  你们完全不知道  是吧
Oh, boy. You guys don't have any clue, do you?

387
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,880
等等
Hold on.

388
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:04,580
我们怎么知道你不是那种变形者

嫌疑人在北行列车上  正在追赶

00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,110
放开
Get off!

403

神盾局官方行动  别过来

所有地球上的生命都是碳基的  但他不是

422
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,610
不管他是什么做的
Whatever he runs on,

423
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:17,110
反正周期表上没有
it's not on the periodic table.

424
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,770
你是说  他不是这里的
You're saying he's not from around here?

你的眼睛怎么样了
How's your eye?

426
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,920
眼睛倒没事
Well, I'd say fine...

427
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,650
就是不敢相信我看到的东西
but it can't believe what it's seeing.

428
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:35,600
你说这玩意之前是科尔森的样子

说话也像
Talked like him, too.

430
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,180
那女人说还有更多这种人

431
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,480
她说的是"潜入"

我能找到那个百视达姑娘

有桩摩托车盗窃的报案
I got word on a motorcycle thief

437
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,550
女贼符合她的描述
that fits her description.

438
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,460
如果她能说出这些蜥蜴人为什么来
If she can tell us why these lizards are here...

439
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,550
或许她也能告诉我们怎么赶走他们

好
Good.

441
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,940
但你自己行动  我们谁都不能信任
Do it alone, though. We can't trust anyone.

442
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,200
连我们自己人都不行
Not even our own men.

443
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,690
是  长官
Yes, sir.

444
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,050
他们可真丑  是吧
They're ugly bastards, aren't they?

445
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,710
是啊  可不比布拉德·皮特  长官
Yeah, well, he's no Brad Pitt, sir.

446
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,160
安然超度吧  我的朋友

一个机场

453

飞马计划在哪
Where's Pegasus?

454
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,860
那是机密
That's classified.

455
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,100
我给你建立的档案也是
Not unlike the file I started on you.

456
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,950
但看来你还换装了
But I see you've changed it up a bit since then.

457
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,530
垃圾摇滚挺衬你
Grunge is a good look for you.

458
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,250
你今天不顺吗  弗瑞特工
Did you have a rough day, Agent Fury?

459
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,990
还行吧
It was cool, you know?

460
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,870
遭遇了太空入侵  大型追车

还看了一场外星人尸检

462
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,260
也就典型的工作日
Typical nine-to-five.

463
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,450
你看到一个了
So you saw one?

464
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,290
我并不怎么信外星人
I was never one to believe in aliens...

465
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,290
但那画面我是忘不掉了
but I can't unsee that.

466
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,410
这会比较尴尬  但我必须问
This is gonna get a little awkward, but I gotta ask.

467
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,740
你觉得我也是那种绿玩意
You think I'm one of those green things.

468
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,070
小心驶得万年船

我可是百分百的红血地球人
You are looking at 100% red-blooded Earth man.

470
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,630
我恐怕需要点证明
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.

471
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,720
你是想验唾液还是验尿
We talking cheek swab or urine sample?

472
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,560
不  DNA也会一样的
No. The DNA would match.

473
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,800
那我的美国在线密码呢
Want my AOL password?

474
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,120
斯库鲁人只能模仿宿主的近期记忆
Skrulls can only sim recent memories of their host bodies.

475
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,870

说出一个非常怪异

如果一片吐司被对角切开  我就不能吃了

以潜入并夺取星球

他们认为她在飞马计划

520
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,980

劳森的光速引擎图纸

586
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:44,440
{\an8}项目中止

587
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:45,170
他们为什么中止了这个项目呢
I wonder why they terminated the project.

588
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:48,370
或许是因为她
Maybe because she's

589
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,170
疯了
cuckoo.

590
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,850

594
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:06,020
什么
What?

595
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,970
她在一次未授权试飞中
She crashed the Asis aircraft

596
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:10,150
撞毁了一架艾西斯战机
doing an unauthorized test flight.

597
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,940
还害死了个飞行员
Took a pilot down with her.

598
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,590
所以这里的保安才那么不友好
That's why security here is so unfriendly.

599
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:17,400
他们在掩盖一个价值十亿的过失

600
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,870
你的光速引擎也烧毁了

601

大部分文件都编辑过了
Most of this thing's redacted...

605
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,850
但这里有一份玛利亚·兰博的证词

606
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,850
她是最后见到活着的她们的人

607
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,380
{\an8}信息收到  凯勒

611
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:30,580
而是为了结束战争
It's about ending them.

612
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,970
我知道劳森是克里人

00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:40,970
她就在C53星球上  而且死于坠机

614

你对此知情吗
Do you know anything about this?

615
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:46,980
我刚发现了一份C53发来的任务报告
I just discovered a mission report sent from C-53.

616
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:50,850
我有权告诉你的不多  弗斯  但是
There's only so much I'm cleared to tell you, Vers, but...

617
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:58,760
劳森是一名卧底克里特工  名叫玛威尔
Lawson was an undercover Kree operative named Mar-Vell.

618
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,270
她在研究一种独特的能量核

实验一种据说可以
Experimenting with tech that apparently

620
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,700
助我们赢下战争的科技
could help us win the war.

621
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,200
她还在吗
She still here?

622
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,540
她在配合调查  长官
She's cooperating with the investigation, sir.

623
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,880
-你们留下  -是  长官
- You men stay here. - Yes, sir.

624
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,550
我要单独审讯她
I want to question her alone.

625
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,540
干得漂亮  尼古拉斯
Excellent work, Nicholas.

626
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,080
上面提到我了吗
Does it say anything about me?

627
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,330
提到你  当然没有
Anything about you? No, of course not.

628
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:34,430
怎么会呢
Why would it?

629
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:37,610
我找到证据  表明我曾在这里生活
I found evidence that I had a life here.

630
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,290
在C53上吗
On C-53?

631
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,880
我去见至高智慧时  看到的就是玛威尔
Mar-Vell is who I see when I visit the Supreme Intelligence.

632
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:48,300
我认识她  我认识身为劳森的她
I knew her. And I knew her as Lawson.

633
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,620
这更像是斯库鲁人的模仿  弗斯
This sounds like Skrull simulation, Vers.

634
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,600
不  不是  因为我记得  我来过这里
No, it's not. Because I remember. I was here.

635
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:54,470
停下  记住你的训练
Stop. Remember your training.

636
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:56,580
了解你的敌人  你也可能是你的敌人
Know your enemy. It could be you.

637
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:00,180
别被情绪影响了你的判断力
Do not let your emotions override your judgment.

638
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:03,340
她在地下六层
She's on sublevel six.

639
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,580
我在五层下
I'll get off on five...

640
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,910
走楼梯  以防她企图逃跑
and take the stairs in case she makes a run for it.

641
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,500
像我们在哈瓦那时那样  两面夹击
Do a pincer move like we did in Havana.

642
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,490
对
Right.

643
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,790
就像在哈瓦那时那样
Like we did in Havana.

644
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:26,460
我们快到跳跃点了
We're nearing the jump point.

645
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,530
别关信标  让我们能找到你
Leave your beacon on so I can find you.

646
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:30,600
我们会查清真相的  弗斯
We'll get to the bottom of this, Vers.

647
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,320
我们一起
Together.

648
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,400
好
Okay.

649
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,530
弗斯
Vers!

650
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,640
弗斯
Vers!

651
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:17,680
弗瑞在与目标串通
Fury's colluding with the target.

652
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,920
那他为什么要叫支援
Then why would he call us in?

653
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,390
我只知道他也要抓
All I know is we take him in, too.

654
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:21,510
不论死活
Dead or alive.

655
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,680
不论死活
Dead or alive?

656
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:38,960
上上
Go. Go, go!

657
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:53,300
是我说错了什么吗
Was it something I said?

658
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:36,280
其实  我并不需要这个也能看见
Now, you know, I don't really need these to see...

659
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:40,670
但这身打扮少不了它
but they do kinda complete the look.

660
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,850
是不是
Don't you think?

661
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:01,380
你叫他们来的
You called them in?

662
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,660
我不好
My bad.

663
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,030
科尔森  你发现他们了吗
Coulson, do you have eyes on them?

664
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,190
他们不在下面
They're not down here.

665
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,580
我们上楼吧
Let's try up there.

666
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:33,800
-什么  -你的通讯器
- What? - Your communicator.

667
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,660
在你手里显然不安全
You obviously can't be trusted with it.

668
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,160
你会飞这玩意吗
Do you know how to fly this thing?

669
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:09,450
试试便知
We'll see.

670
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:11,690
回答会不会就行了
That's a yes or no question.

671
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,560
会
Yes.

672
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,500
这就对了
That's what I'm talking about!

673
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:50,190
我们有个偷渡者
We got a stowaway.

674
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:55,190
撑住  咕咕
Hang on, Goose.

675
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:01,680
咕咕
Goose.

676
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,700
不  咕咕
No, Goose.

677
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,740
谁是只乖喵喵
Who's a good kitty, huh?

678
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:09,900
咕咕
Goose?

679
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:12,500
没错
Yes, that's right.

680
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,570
谁是只乖喵喵  咕咕
Who's a good kitty, Goose?

681
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:15,660
你是只乖喵喵
You the good kitty, that's right.

682
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,300
看到认识的人了吗
See anyone you know?

683
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,900
说来好笑
Funny story.

684
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,930
我奄奄一息地被送到哈拉  失去了记忆
I arrived on Hala near dead. No memory.

685
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,210
那是六年前的事
That was six years ago.

686
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:28,230
所以你觉得你是那个
So, you think you're the pilot

687
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:29,730
跟劳森博士一起坠机的飞行员
that went down with Dr. Lawson?

688
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,580
我是说  最后见到活着的她们的人
I'm saying the last person to see them alive

689
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,100
或许能告诉我们
could probably tell us.

690
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,580
玛利亚·兰博
Maria Rambeau?

691
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:37,090
我们怎么去路易斯安那州
So, how do we get to Louisiana?

692
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,400
往东飞  在孟菲斯右转
Due east. Hang a right at Memphis.

693
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:42,990
那个特工
That agent...

694
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,950
阻止了斯库鲁人找到我们的那个
that stopped the Skrulls from finding us?

695
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:47,500
科尔森  新来的
Coulson. The new guy.

696
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:49,650
看来他还不恨我
I guess he doesn't hate me yet.

697
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:51,390
是啊  给他时间吧
Yeah, well, give him time.

698
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:55,110
看来他是有种感觉
I guess he had a feeling, you know?

699
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:57,110
于是听从了直觉  而违抗命令
Went with his gut against orders.

700
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,940
这是很难做到的
That's a really hard thing to do.

701
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:01,080
但也是我们的人性
But it's what keeps us human.

702
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,450
我经常为此惹麻烦呢
I get in trouble for that. A lot.

703
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,240
这我看出来了
I can see that about you.

704
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:09,430
营救把你出卖给斯库鲁人的家伙
Rescuing the guy who sold you out to the Skrulls?

705
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:13,160
那不是标准的克里人行动规章吧
I'm guessing that's not standard Kree operating procedure.

706
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,490
如果你不向我上级打小报告  那我也不说
Well, I won't tell your boss if you don't tell mine.

707
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,680
罗南
Ronan.

708
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:26,730
指控者已完成了行动
The Accusers completed their operation...

709
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:29,310
但因为你们小队  更重要的任务失败了
but the greater mission was a failure, thanks to your team.

710
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,740
那是个陷阱
It was a trap

711
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,930
是为引诱我们的特工弗斯到托法  好绑架她
to lure our operative Vers to Torfa and kidnap her.

712
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:35,010
告诉我们地点
Give us their location.

713
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:36,760
我们会解决恐怖分子威胁
We'll take care of the terrorist threat.

714
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,640
你要把他们炸出银河系吗
By bombing them out of the galaxy?

715
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:42,080
不  我们来解决
No, we'll handle this.

716
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,960
不论在哪  一小撮斯库鲁人
A cell of Skrulls anywhere

717
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,250
对所有克里人都是威胁
is a threat to Kree everywhere.

718
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:47,380
他们在哪
Where are they?

719
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,760
-他们...  -不见了
- They are... - Lost.

720
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,490
暂时下落不明
They are lost for now.

721
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,390
但我们会找到他们的
But we will find them.

722
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,620
那去吧
Do so,

723
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:58,330
否则我们就接手
or we will.

724
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,430
继续航向C53
Maintain the course for C-53.

725
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,860
打扰  我找玛利亚·兰博
Excuse me, I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

726
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,600
卡罗尔阿姨
Auntie Carol?

727
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,810
妈妈  是卡罗尔阿姨
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

728
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:35,350
我就知道  大家都说你死了
I knew it! Everyone said you were dead!

729
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,260
但我们知道他们说谎了
But we knew they were lying.

730
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:41,840
我不是你以为的那个人
I'm not really who you think I am.

731
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:53,100
这是我听过的最疯狂的故事了
That is the craziest shit I ever heard.

732
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,210
会变形的绿外星人  没有这种事
Green transforming aliens? There's no such thing.

733
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,850
你说得太对了  小姑娘
You are absolutely right, young lady.

734
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,490
是没有这种事
There is no such thing.

735
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:00,900
因为即便有
'Cause if there were,

736
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:03,590
我们也不会想说出去
we would want to keep that to ourselves.

737
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:04,850
你不信吗
You don't believe me?

738
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,340
不会吧
No way!

739
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,970
好酷啊
That's so cool!

740
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:19,220
她的手可不止能泡茶呢
She can do a lot more than make tea with those hands.

741
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,740
比如呢  露两手
Like what? Show us.

742
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:22,310
待会儿的吧
Maybe later.

743
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:24,340
你的东西我都还留着呢
I kept all your stuff.

744
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,480
我去拿
I'll go get it.

745
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,360
你要去帮帮她吗
You want to give her a hand with that?

746
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,470
你什么都不记得了
You don't remember anything?

747
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,480
我会看到些片段
I see flashes.

748
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,980
一些时刻
Little moments.

749
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,530
但我不知道那是不是真的
But I can't tell what's real.

750
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:01,600
如果我可以把那天早上发生的事拼凑起来
If I could just piece together what happened that morning...

751
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,760
或许就都能说得通了
maybe it'll all make sense.

752
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:11,420
你破晓时猛敲我的门  把我吵醒了
You woke me up banging on my door at dawn.

753
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:12,890
你总这样
Your usual move.

754
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,160
当时  我们必须起得很早
Back then, we had to get up so early.

755
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,280
空军还是不许女性飞战斗任务
The Air Force still wasn't letting women fly combat...

756
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,750
所以  为劳森测试飞机是我们
so testing Lawson's planes was our only shot

757
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,240
唯一能做点要紧事的机会
at doing something that mattered.

758
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,240
你想开你的老野马飙车去基地
You wanted to race to base in your old Mustang...

759
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:27,300
我并不想跟你争
and I wasn't about to argue,

760
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,170
因为我知道我的科迈罗稳赢不输
'cause I knew my Camaro would dominate.

761
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:31,520
但你作弊了  走了捷径
But you cheated, took a shortcut.

762
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:32,790
捷径怎么就算作弊了
Since when is a shortcut cheating?

763
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:35,270
因为那有违预定的交战规则
Since it violates the predetermined rules of engagement.

764
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:37,120
这我可绝对不记得
I definitely don't remember those.

765
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:38,590
当然了
Of course you don't.

766
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:48,590
我到机库时  劳森很焦躁
When I got to the hangar, Lawson was agitated.

767
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,820
她说她还要拯救生命
She said she had lives to save.

768
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:54,630
她想自己开艾西斯
She was trying to take the Asis up herself,

769
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,780
但你说...
but you said that...

770
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:59,370
如果事关人命  那我要来开
If there were lives at stake, I would fly the plane.

771
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:00,420
对
Yeah.

772
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:01,740
对
Yep.

773
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,600
重大的英雄时刻
Big hero moment.

774
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,530
那种我们都一直在等待的时刻
The kind of moment we'd both been waiting for.

775
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,750
博士一向很特别
The doc was always unique.

776
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,740
所以我们喜欢她
That's why we liked her.

777
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,490
但现在你说她是另一个星球来的
But now you're saying she's from another planet.

778
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,650
我知道你肯定很难接受
I know this must be hard for you.

779
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,330
怎么  这部分吗
Oh, what? This part right here?

780
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,860
不  不
No. No.

781
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,780
难的部分是失去我最好的朋友
What's hard is losing my best friend...

782
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:33,420
但这任务太机密
in a mission so secret

783
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,680
他们就假装什么都没发生
they act like it never even happened.

784
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:41,280
难的部分是知道你一直都活在某处
Hard is knowing you were out there somewhere

785
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,150
固执地不肯死去
too damn stubborn to die.

786
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,630
现在时隔六年  你又跑来
And now you come up in here after six years...

787
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:49,700
双手能发射高能
with your supercharged fire hands...

788
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,290
还要我喊你
and you expect me to call you...

789
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:53,400
什么...弗斯吗
I don't even know what. Vers?

790
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,020
你现在真是这个人了吗
Is that really who you are now?

791
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,560
我不知道
I don't know.

来看看

这是你小时候
This is you when you were little.

799
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:23,000
你跟你父母关系不好
You didn't get along with your parents...

800
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
所以妈妈说  我们成了你真正的家人
so Mom said we became your real family.

801
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,800
这是我们圣诞节的时候
This is us on Christmas.

802

01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,110
你的外套

812
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,940
我在上面洒了番茄酱
Mom doesn't let me wear it anymore

813
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:47,940
妈妈就不许我穿了
after I spilled ketchup on it.

814
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:04,070

那是坠机时唯一留下的
That was all that survived the crash.

816
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,110
至少我们以为是
Or so we thought.

817
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,050
别去开门
Don't answer that.

818
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,360
只是我的邻居

819

老天爷
Yowzers.

826
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:36,210
这里的静电可真要命
Static electricity out here's no joke.

827
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:39,270
我注意到你停在路边的那架大鸟
I noticed that peculiar bird you got parked by the road...

828
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:40,360
我只是想问
and I was just wondering...

829
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,140
我能不能带孩子们过来
if you mind if I bring the boys over

830
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,440
仔细看看
to get a closer look-see?

831
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,640
-仔细看看  -是啊
- A closer look-see? - Yeah.

832
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,640
看停在路边的大鸟
To see the "bird" parked out by the road?

833
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:53,070
你装得还真像啊  是吧
You're really working overtime to sell this one, aren't you,

834
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:54,530
塔罗斯
Talos?

835
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,550
抱歉  汤姆  现在真的不太方便
I'm sorry, Tom. This really isn't a good time.

836
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,660
我明天再去找你  好吗
I'll come by tomorrow, okay?

837
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,750
好了
Okay.

838
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:06,800
你该对邻居更客气点的
You know, you really should be kinder to your neighbors.

839
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:10,370
说不定哪天还要去借糖呢
You never know when you're gonna need to borrow some sugar.

840
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:15,830
等一下
Now, hang on a second.

841
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:19,430
先别急着挥你的魔术手
Before you go swinging those jazz hands around...

842
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,430
把你朋友家砸得稀巴烂
making a mess of your friend's house...

843
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:24,280
而且你家很漂亮  女士
It's a lovely home, miss.

844
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,650
天呐
Oh, my God!

845
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,720
怎么回事
What the hell?

846
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,230
没人会伤害她的
No one's gonna hurt the girl.

847
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,750
别杀我
Just don't kill me.

848
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:38,190
那样情况就真的麻烦了
That would really complicate the situation.

849
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:40,740
我再过五秒就要麻烦一墙的
I'm about five seconds from complicating that wall

850
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:42,480
恶心斯库鲁脑浆了
with some ugly-ass Skrull brains.

851
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,030
抱歉我模仿了你的上司
I'm sorry I simmed your boss.

852
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:47,420
但现在  我以真身站在你们面前
But now I stand before you as my true self.

853
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,900
没有欺骗
Without deception.

854
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,390
那外面的是谁
And who is that out there?

855
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,370
好吧  有道理
Okay, that's a fair point...

856
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:55,340
但我相信你能理解
but I'm sure that you understand

857
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:57,540
我必须采取些预防措施
I had to take some precautions.

858
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:01,040
我看到你碾压了我20个最好的手下
I saw you crush 20 of my best men

859
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,470
而且你的手还被困着
with your hands bound.

860
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,510
我只想谈谈
I just wanna talk.

861
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:04,390
上次我们谈时
Last time we talked,

862
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:06,000
我被倒吊了起来
I ended up hanging from my ankles.

863
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,460
那时我还不知道你的身份
That was before I knew who you were.

864
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:11,680
我还不知道你跟其他人的不同之处
Before I knew what made you different from the others.

865
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,360
我有段飞马计划的录音
I have an audio recording from Pegasus...

866
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,030
录的是六年前一场坠机中
of your voice from a plane crash

867
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:19,810
你的声音
six years ago...

868
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:24,120
那个设备好像被你们称为"黑匣子"
on a device I believe you call a "black box."

869
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,890
他们说黑匣子毁于了坠机
They told me it was destroyed in the crash.

870
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,400
你怎么拿到的
How'd you get it?

871
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,520
她不懂
She don't understand.

872
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,340
小姑娘  我有独特的技能  让我可以
Young lady, I have a special skill that kind of allows me to

873
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,700
进入我不该进的地方
get into places I'm not supposed to be.

874
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,000
你再敢喊我"小姑娘"
Call me "young lady" again...

875
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,590
我就一脚踢到我不该踢到的地方
I'm gonna put my foot in a place it's not supposed to be.

876
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,300
难道要我猜那是哪里吗
Am I supposed to guess where that is?

877
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:44,940
你的屁股
Your ass.

878
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,740
好吧  我懂  我们都有点紧张
Okay, I get it. We're all a little on edge here.

879
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,430
但听着  我只需要你帮我
But, look, I just need your help

01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:51,140
解码一个坐标
decoding some coordinates.

881
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:53,190
如果你坐下  听听录音
If you'll sit down and you'll listen to this...

882
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:56,320
我保证  你不会失望的
I assure you, it'll be worth your while.

883
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,160
把你的朋友叫进来  我就听
Call your buddy back inside and I'll listen.

884
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,080
好
Deal.

885
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:05,650
天呐  把那玩意拿远点
Oh, my God! Get that thing away.

886
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:07,240
它怎么进来的
How'd that get in here?

887
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:10,910
猫吗
The cat?

888
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:12,770
你不会怕这个吧
This isn't what you're afraid of, is it?

889
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:14,180
那不是猫
That's not a cat.

890
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:17,130
-那是噬元兽  -噬元兽
- That's a Flerken. - A Flerken?

莫妮卡
Monica.

893
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:28,740
我为什么不能听
Why can't I listen, too?

894
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:57,780
怎么回事
What's happening?

我的雷达上没有显示
It's not showing up on my radar.

929
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:25,120
该死
Damn it!

我的真名是玛威尔
My real name is Mar-Vell,

我来自哈拉星球
and I come from a planet called Hala.

933
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,980
我想说你是脑袋糊涂了
I would say that you're delusional... but

934
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,530
但我们刚被太空飞船打下来
we just got shot down by a spaceship

935

你的血又是蓝的

听着  我半辈子都在打一场可耻的战争

你快走吧  别让我更加懊悔了

记住那坐标  好吗
Just remember the coordinates, okay?

939
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,930
你得单独救他们了
You gotta save 'em without me.

01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,160
救谁  怎么救
Save who? How?

941
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:58,400
我得在他们找到前炸毁引擎
Now I gotta blow this engine before they find it.

942
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,560
你干什么
What are you doing?

01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,840
我们无意伤害你
We have no interest in hurting you.

944
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:22,880
是吗
No?

945
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,090
因为你们猛烈的火力让我不那么觉得
'Cause all the shooting kinda gave me the wrong impression!

946
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,030
能量核
The energy core.

947
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:30,970
在哪
Where is it?

948
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,850
伞兵救援很快就到
Pararescue's on the way.

949
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:36,180
还有两分钟  你就会被包围
You have two minutes until you're surrounded.

950
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,650
那就没必要继续跟你废话了
Then I see no reason to prolong this conversation.

951
01:09:38,650 --> 01:09:39,680
不  等等
No, wait!

952
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,860
你是问那个能量核吗
You mean that energy core?

953
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:53,420
不
No!

954
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:40,640
指挥官  她还在动  可以开火吗
Commander? She's still moving. Permission to fire.

955
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:41,830
别开火
Hold your fire.

956
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,860
什么都不剩了
There's nothing left.

957
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,190
核被摧毁了
The core has been destroyed.

958
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:00,010
{\an8}弗斯

959
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:06,680
她吸收了核的能量
She absorbed its power.

960
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,520
她要跟我们走
She's coming with us.

961
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:32,920
他骗了我
He lied to me.

962
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:37,770
我所知的一切都是谎言
Everything that I knew was a lie.

963
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:40,540
现在你明白了
Now, you understand.

964
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:43,140
什么  我明白什么了
What? What do I understand now?

965
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:45,170
勇·罗格杀了玛威尔
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

966
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:46,340
他杀了她
He killed her...

967
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:48,310
因为她发现
'cause she found out that

968
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:52,720
自己站在战争中不正义的一方
she was on the wrong side of an unjust war.

969
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,750
不
No.

970
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:56,230
斯库鲁人都是恐怖分子
Your people are terrorists.

971
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:57,860
他们杀无辜者
They kill innocents.

972
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,530
我看到托法上的废墟了
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

973
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:02,690
那是指控者干的
Ruins that the Accusers are responsible for.

974
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:07,430
我们是作为难民在托法上生活
My people lived as refugees on Torfa.

975
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:10,660
无家可归  就因为我们反对克里统治
Homeless, ever since we resisted Kree rule...

976
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,900
被他们摧毁了家园
and they destroyed our planet.

977
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:15,440
我们仅剩的不多的人
And the handful of us that are left

978
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:18,720
也会遭到屠戮
will be slaughtered next...

979
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:22,680
除非你帮我完成玛威尔的目标
unless you help me finish what Mar-Vell started.

980
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:25,370
她发现的核
The core that she found

981
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:27,110
能驱动光速飞船
would have powered a light-speed ship...

982
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:29,120
可以带我们前往安全之处
capable of carrying us to safety.

983
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:33,180
前往克里人找不到的新家园
A new home where the Kree can't reach us.

984
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:37,030
劳森总说我们飞马计划的工作
Lawson always told us that our work at Pegasus

985
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,630
不是为了作战
wasn't to fight wars...

986
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,940
是为了结束战争
but to end them.

987
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:45,390
她希望你帮我们找到能量核
She wanted you to help us find the core.

988
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:47,950
我已经摧毁了它
Well, I already destroyed it.

989
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:49,660
不  你毁掉了引擎
No, you destroyed the engine.

990
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:52,560
但驱动它的能量核在其他地方
The core that powered it is in a remote location.

991
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:56,370
如果你能帮我们解码坐标
If you help us decode those coordinates...

992
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:58,620
我们就能找到它
we can find it.

993
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:02,650
你会用它对付我们的
You'll use it to destroy us.

994
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:07,410
我们只想要个家
We just want a home.

995
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:17,020
你和我都因克里人失去了一切
You and I lost everything at the hands of the Kree.

996
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:18,880
你还不明白吗
Can't you see it now?

997
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:20,940
你不是他们的人
You're not one of them.

998
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:24,940
你不了解我
You don't know me.

999
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:28,930
你不知道我是谁
You have no idea who I am.

1000
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:33,090
我都不知道我是谁   永久域名CCTV12306.COM
I don't even know who I am!

1001
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:36,840
你是卡罗尔·丹弗斯
You are Carol Danvers.

1002
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:39,900
你是那个黑匣子上录下的女人
You are the woman on that black box

1003
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:42,870
为了做正确的事不惜冒生命危险
risking her life to do the right thing.

1004
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,190
我最好的朋友
My best friend...

1005
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,480
在我没有其他人时  支持我这个单亲妈妈
who supported me as a mother and a pilot

1006
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,020
和飞行员
when no one else did.

1007
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:56,030
你聪明  幽默  非常烦人
You are smart, and funny, and a huge pain in the ass...

1008
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,940
你是我认识的最强大的人
and you were the most powerful person I knew...

1009
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,920
哪怕是你还不会用手开火的时候
way before you could shoot fire from your fists.

1010
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,270
你听到了吗
You hear me?

1011
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,330
你听到了吗
Do you hear me?

1012
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:18,040
过来  过来  姑娘
Come here. Come here, girl.

1013
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:20,040
有我呢
I got you.

1014
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:27,110
我知道我不配让你信任我
I know I don't deserve your trust...

1015
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:29,850
但你是我们唯一的线索
but you were our only lead.

1016
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:32,470
我们发现你的能量信号
We discovered that your energy signature

1017
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:34,880
与玛威尔的能量核一致
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1018
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:37,380
现在我们知道原因了
Now we know why.

1019
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:43,750
如果你知道它对我是多么重要
If only you knew the importance of it to me.

1020
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,320
我就需要你帮我
I just need your help

1021
01:14:46,410 --> 01:14:50,160
破解玛威尔实验室的坐标
decoding the coordinates to Mar-Vell's lab.

1022
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:53,970
那不是坐标  是状态向量
Those weren't coordinates. They're state vectors.

1023
01:14:53,970 --> 01:14:55,930
环绕位置和速度的
For orbital position and velocity.

1024
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:57,650
你在地球上找不到她的实验室
You didn't find her lab on Earth,

1025
01:14:57,650 --> 01:14:59,080
因为它不在地球上
'cause it's not on Earth.

1026
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:01,660
那是六年前坠机日时的地点
That was the location on the date of the crash six years ago.

1027
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:02,820
只要追踪其轨迹
If we track its course,

1028
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:05,470
马上就能在环绕轨道上找到它
we'll find it in orbit right now.

1029
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:07,160
只是基本物理
It's just basic physics.

1030
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,110
轨道环绕
In orbit?

1031
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:14,500
就那么难破解吗
Was that so difficult to figure out?

1032
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,810
你可是我的科技人员
I mean, you're my science guy, right?

1033
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:19,360
勇·罗格很快就会找到我
Yon-Rogg will catch up to me soon.

1034
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,430
我们得在他之前找到能量核
We've got to get to the core before he does.

1035
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:23,860
我们上太空吗
We're going to space?

1036
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:25,530
乘什么去
In what?

1037
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:27,640
稍稍调整下你的飞机应该就行
A few tweaks to your vessel should do it.

1038
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,940
我可以负责改装
I can handle the modifications.

1039
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:31,340
你的科技人员
Your science guy.

1040
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:40,140
我需要个副驾
Well, I could use a copilot.

1041
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:44,200
不  我不能
No. No, I can't.

1042
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,470
我不能丢下莫妮卡
I can't leave Monica.

1043
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:49,040
妈妈  没事  我可以去外婆外公家住
Mom, it's okay. I can stay with Gramma and Paw-paw.

1044
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:51,550
我不能去  宝贝  太危险了
There's no way I'm going, baby. It's too dangerous.

1045
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:53,660
测试新航空科技还危险呢
Testing brand-new aerospace tech is dangerous...

1046
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:55,120
你以前不也做那个吗
and you used to do that.

1047
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,280
你的计划是乘坐一架
Your plan is to leave the atmosphere

1048
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,190
原本不能离开大气的飞机离开大气
in a craft not designed for the journey...

1049
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:01,830
而且还可能遭遇
and you anticipate hostile encounters

1050
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:04,400
科技更先进的外星敌人
with a technologically-superior foreign enemy.

1051
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,440
是吗
Correct?

1052
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,960
所以我说啊
That's what I'm saying.

1053
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,120
-你必须去  -莫妮卡
- You have to go! - Monica!

1054
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,590
你有机会去执行任务史上
You have a chance to fly the coolest mission

1055
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:10,910
最酷的任务
in the history of missions...

1056
01:16:10,910 --> 01:16:12,510
你要放弃这机会  坐在沙发上
and you're gonna give it up to sit on the couch

1057
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:14,280
跟我一起看《新鲜王子》吗
and watch Fresh Prince with me?

1058
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:15,450
什么
What?

1059
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:17,020
我觉得你该好好想想
I just think you should consider

1060
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:19,800
你在给你的女儿立下什么样的榜样
what kind of example you're setting for your daughter.

1061
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,160
这是怎么回事
What's going on around here?

1062
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:29,870
我知道
I know, I know.

1063
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,520
我去里面解释  谢谢你们
I'll explain inside. Thank you.

1064
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:38,750
你妈妈很幸运
Your mom's lucky.

1065
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:40,580
天上发孩子时
When they were handing out kids,

1066
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:42,390
给了她最坚强的一个
they gave her the toughest one.

1067
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:44,500
捣蛋中尉
Lieutenant Trouble.

1068
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,520
你记得了
You remembered.

1069
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:49,160
那是我的吗
Is that mine?

1070
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:51,420
不
No, no.

1071
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:54,450
你留着吧  等我回来再说
You hang on to it until I come back.

1072
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:58,020
但有件事我需要你帮忙
But there is something that I need your help with.

1073
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:00,330
我不能再穿克里人的颜色了
I can't wear these Kree colors anymore.

1074
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:03,720
而因为你显然是这里唯一
And since you are obviously the only person around here

1075
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,340
有时尚感的人
with any sense of style...

1076
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,070
不行
No.

1077
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:21,610
绝对不行
Definitely not.

1078
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,660
既然我们是一队的
Well, since we're on the same team...

1079
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:41,860
我看上去如何
How do I look?

1080
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:46,730
靓丽
Fresh.

1081
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:08,130
你怎么才来
What took you so long?

1082
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,260
我很好  多谢关心
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

1083
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,080
-PRY46B  -不  不说密码了
- PRY46-B... - No, no codes.

1084
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,230
这系统不可靠了  我们都知道了
That system is fallible, as we've learned.

1085
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,770
好吧  那我们开始吧
Okay, then let's do this.

1086
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:22,760
我与至高智慧密谈时  看到的是谁
Who do I see when I commune with the Supreme Intelligence?

1087
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:25,770
你最崇拜尊敬的人吧
The person you most admire and respect, I'd guess.

1088
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,410
但你绝不会告诉我是谁的
But you would never tell me who.

1089
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,640
你对哈拉最早的记忆是什么
And what is your earliest memory of Hala?

1090
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,910
输血
The transfusion.

1091
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:35,280
蓝血流过我的血管
Blue blood running through my veins.

1092
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:36,790
谁的血
Whose blood?

1093
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,490
流过她血管的是我的血
That's my blood that's coursing through her veins.

1094
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,970
你把她怎么了
What have you done with her?

1095
01:18:57,970 --> 01:18:59,210
你太迟了
You're too late.

1096
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:17,790
她知道了
She knows?

1097
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,810
罗南  斯库鲁人已潜入了C53

为了全体克里人  指挥官
For the good of all Kree, Commander,

1100
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:41,670
入侵者会被根除的

1101
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:46,310
高度500  还在攀升
Passing 500 and climbing.

1102
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,490
你真的不该把那玩意放腿上
You know, you really shouldn't have that thing on your lap.

1103
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:56,010
我们跟你的联盟没那么可靠
Our little alliance with you is tenuous at best.

1104
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:58,900
只要它还能吓到你
And as long as he continues to freak you out...

1105
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,090
就像这样
like that...

1106
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:02,090
嗯  我就要继续
yeah, I'm gonna keep giving him

1107
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:05,620
爱它抱它  让它满意
all the loves and hugs that he needs, right?

1108
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:07,270
我能问你件事吗
Can I ask you something?

1109
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:09,320
你可以想变成什么变成什么
Do you just turn into anything you want?

1110
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:11,180
我得先看到
Well, I have to see it first.

1111
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:12,700
你们都能吗
Can you all do it?

1112
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:14,620
从生理学上讲  是的
Physiologically? Yeah.

1113
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:16,880
但这是需要练习的
But, uh, it takes practice...

1114
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,980
不瞒你说  还需要天赋  才能做好
and, um, dare I say it, talent to do it well.

1115
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:23,460
-你能变成猫吗  -猫是什么
- Can you turn into a cat? - What's a cat?

1116
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:25,120
那文件柜呢
What about a filing cabinet?

1117
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:28,510
我为什么要变成文件柜
Why would I turn into a filing cabinet?

1118
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:29,410
捕蝇草呢
A Venus flytrap?

1119
01:20:29,410 --> 01:20:30,630
如果你能变成捕蝇草
I'll give you 50 bucks right now

1120
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:32,350
我这就给你50块
if you turn into a Venus flytrap.

1121
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:35,320
超音速燃烧冲压式喷气引擎切换至核聚变引擎
Switching engines from Scramjet to Fusion.

1122
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,760
坐稳了  各位
Buckle up, folks.

1123
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:49,350
这正常吗  是太空紊流吗
Is this normal, like, space turbulence?

1124
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:50,490
差不多吧
Pretty much.

1125
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,900
锁定坐标网格
Locking in on coordinate grid.

1126
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:27,980
它在哪呢
Where is it?

1127
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,590
就在这里  肯定在这里
It's here. It's gotta be here.

1128
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:39,420
那是在空空荡荡前面还是后面
Well, is it in front of all that nothing, or behind it?

1129
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:46,940
去隐形启动
Decloaking activated.

1130
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:02,850
{\an9}{\pos(167.4,201.6)}玛威尔的实验室

1131
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:02,850
{\an9}{\pos(167.4,218.866)}克里帝国巡航舰

1132
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,830
就是那个吗  能量核
Is that it? The core?

1133
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:54,040
在她的笔记里  她称之为宇宙魔方
In her notes she called it the Tesseract.

1134
01:23:02,790 --> 01:23:05,520
劳森怎么会有这么多孩子玩具
What was Lawson doing with all this kid stuff?

1135
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:06,620
{\an8}方子

1136
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:20,120
这里有别人
We're not alone.

1137
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:44,110
塔罗斯
Talos!

1138
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:56,780
他不是来找宇宙魔方的
He didn't come here for the Tesseract.

1139
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:20,980
没事
It's okay.

1140
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:27,800
我们不知道该怎么办
We didn't know what to do.

1141
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:30,870
玛威尔警告我们无论如何都不能发信号
Mar-Vell warned us not to send a signal for any reason...

1142
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,020
否则会被克里人找到
or the Kree would find us.

1143
01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:34,590
你做得对
You did the right thing.

1144
01:24:44,810 --> 01:24:46,150
没事
It's okay, it's okay.

1145
01:24:46,850 --> 01:24:48,760
她没事  她是个朋友
She's all right. She's a friend.

1146
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:52,420
我不会伤害你们的
I am not gonna hurt you.

1147
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,200
是她让我找到你们的
She led me to you.

1148
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,630
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1149
01:24:58,540 --> 01:24:59,810
我之前不知道
I didn't know.

1150
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:01,120
卡罗尔
Carol.

1151
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:03,460
这是战争
This is war.

1152
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:07,060
我手上也沾满了鲜血
My hands are filthy from it, too.

1153
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,150
但我们走到了这一步
But we're here now.

1154
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,940
你找到了我的家人
You found my family.

1155
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:18,890
这只是个开始
This is just the beginning.

1156
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:22,130
我们还有数千人  散落在银河系各处
There are thousands of us separated from each other...

1157
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:25,620
彼此分离
scattered throughout the galaxy.

1158
01:25:37,730 --> 01:25:40,530
{\an8}太空入侵者  最高分

1159
01:25:43,550 --> 01:25:45,960
如果我同一台弹球机玩六年
If I played the same pinball machine for six years...

1160
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:47,760
也能打出很高的分
I'd have some high scores, too.

1161
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:52,690
亲近敌人
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1162
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:08,340
你把你的制服怎么了
What did you do to your uniform?

1163
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:10,530
他们控制了她的心智  就像我们猜的那样
They got in her head. Just like we thought.

1164
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:12,170
至高智慧能恢复她的心智
The Supreme Intelligence will set her straight.

1165
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:14,110
你看得到他们不是战士
You can see they're not soldiers.

1166
01:26:14,110 --> 01:26:16,140
放了他们吧  把我抓走
Let 'em go. You can have me.

1167
01:26:16,150 --> 01:26:17,370
能量核呢
And the core?

1168
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:19,500
你骗了我
You lied to me.

1169
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:23,170
我让你成了最好的自己
I made you the best version of yourself.

1170
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:29,920
赐予你的也能收回
What's given can be taken away.

1171
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:44,450
过去  快走
Back here! Move, move!

1172
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:46,490
过去  趴下
Get over here. Get down!

1173
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:49,910
快走  走
Let's go! Go, move!

1174
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:31,440
她来了
There she is.

1175
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:34,740
看来你在C53上的经历让你想起了曾经
Seems like your time on C-53 jogged the old memory.

1176
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:37,170
这件外套
This jacket.

1177
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,820
真是帅爆了
It's killer, by the way.

1178
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:44,870
音乐  真不错
The music. It's a nice touch.

1179
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:46,840
放我走
Let me out.

1180
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,180
不行
No can do.

1181
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:52,260
如果你伤害他们  我就把你烧毁
If you hurt them, I will burn you to the ground.

1182
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:53,910
用什么呢
With what exactly?

1183
01:27:54,510 --> 01:27:55,790
你的能力来自我们
Your power comes from us.

1184
01:27:55,790 --> 01:27:58,110
这能力不是你们给的
You didn't give me these powers.

1185
01:27:58,110 --> 01:27:58,970
是那场爆炸
The blast did.

1186
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:00,410
但你一直都不够强大
And yet, you've never had the strength

1187
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:02,000
不能自己控制好
to control them on your own.

1188
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:14,490
物种  噬元兽
Species: Flerken.

1189
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:15,870
威胁程度  高
Threat: high.

1190
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,260
它是只猫  不是汉尼拔·莱克特
It's a cat, not Hannibal Lecter.

1191
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,940
物种  人类男性
Species: human male.

1192
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:31,000
威胁程度  几乎为零
Threat: low to none.

1193
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:33,710
那玩意显然是坏了
That thing's clearly busted.

1194
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:35,410
把噬元兽装上氦核飞船
Load the Flerken onto the Helion.

1195
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,250
把其他的丢进太空
Eject the others into space.

1196
01:28:41,610 --> 01:28:43,270
你做得很棒  王牌
You did good, Ace.

1197
01:28:45,090 --> 01:28:45,840
因为你
Thanks to you...

1198
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,020
那些险恶的变形人
those insidious shapeshifters

1199
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:50,070
再不能威胁我们的边境了
will threaten our borders no more.

1200
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:52,040
我以前相信过你的谎言
I used to believe your lies...

1201
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,530
但斯库鲁人只是在为建立家园而战
but the Skrulls are just fighting for a home.

1202
01:28:55,150 --> 01:28:56,640
你想摧毁他们
You're talking about destroying them

1203
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,690
就因为他们不肯屈从你的规矩
because they won't submit to your rule.

1204
01:28:58,690 --> 01:28:59,930
我也不会屈服的
And neither will I.

1205
01:28:59,930 --> 01:29:02,920
是我们发现了你  我们把你接纳为我们的一员
We found you. We embraced you as our own.

1206
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,120
你们绑架了我
You stole me.

1207
01:29:04,670 --> 01:29:07,920
让我远离家乡  家人  朋友
From my home, my family, my friends.

1208
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:17,840
你的努力真是可爱
It's cute how hard you try.

1209
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:21,070
但记住
But remember...

1210
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:24,030
没有我们
without us...

1211
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:25,480
放弃吧  卡罗尔
Give it up, Carol.

1212
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:27,660
别起来了
Stay down!

1213
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:29,150
你是弱小的
...you're weak.

1214
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:31,690
你开太快了  你得慢点
You're going too fast! You need to go slow!

1215
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:32,540
你是不完美的
You're flawed.

1216
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:34,430
你是想害死自己吗
Are you trying to kill yourself?

1217
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:35,970
无助的
Helpless.

1218
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:37,830
你太情绪化  好弱
You're too emotional and so weak.

1219
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:39,470
你不该来这里
You don't belong out here!

1220
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,370
是我们救了你
We saved you.

1221
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,170
-控制住  -我说了  卡罗尔
- Control it. - I told you, Carol.

1222
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:44,360
他们绝不会让你飞的
They'll never let you fly.

1223
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:45,480
这不是小姑娘的游戏
This ain't a game for little girls.

1224
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,570
你吻技好生硬
You kiss like a horse.

1225
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:48,580
你一周都坚持不住  丹弗斯
You won't last a week, Danvers.

1226
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:53,650
没有我们  你只是人类
Without us, you're only human.

1227
01:29:55,410 --> 01:29:56,430
你说对了
You're right.

1228
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,290
我只是人类
I'm only human.

1229
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:37,130
在哈拉上  你重生了  成为了
On Hala, you were reborn...

1230
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:38,700
弗斯
Vers.

1231
01:30:39,530 --> 01:30:41,700
{\an8}弗斯

1232
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,800
我叫卡罗尔
My name is Carol.

1233
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:03,250
她想挣脱出来
She's trying to break out.

1234
01:31:47,470 --> 01:31:50,560
我一直绑着一只手作战
I've been fighting with one arm tied behind my back.

1235
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:53,320
但如果我
But what happens when...

1236
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,110
终于挣脱开会怎样
I'm finally set free?

1237
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:41,750
你知道你在发光吧
You know you're glowing, right?

1238
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:43,030
回头解释
I'll explain it later.

1239
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:46,780
拿走宇宙魔方
Take the Tesseract.

1240
01:32:46,850 --> 01:32:48,130
留下午餐盒
Leave the lunchbox.

1241
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:49,640
-我吗  -对
- Me? - Yes.

1242
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:51,210
我可不碰那玩意
I'm not touching that thing.

1243
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:52,870
要我给你找副防热手套吗
You want me to get you an oven mitt?

1244
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:07,860
带斯库鲁人上夸式战斗机飞走
Get the Skrulls on the Quadjet and go.

1245
01:33:08,790 --> 01:33:10,750
带上噬元兽
Take the Flerken with you.

1246
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,430
-那你呢  -我给你们争取时间
- What about you? - I'll buy you some time!

1247
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,990
我要把你抱起来了
I'm picking you up now.

1248
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:22,730
我相信你不会吃了我
I'm trusting you not to eat me.

1249
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:29,300
你们好啊
Guys.

1250
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:34,530
为宇宙魔方掰腕子啊
Arm wrestle for the Tesseract?

1251
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,330
我以前还觉得你挺逗
I used to find you amusing.

1252
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:41,620
我们做个了结吧
Let's put an end to this.

1253
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:17,650
好吧
Okay.

1254
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,020
乖喵喵
Good kitty.

1255
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:07,160
你一直都知道
You knew all along.

1256
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:09,830
所以我们才从不一起玩吗
Is that why we never hung out?

1257
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:11,320
不  我就是不喜欢你
No, I just never liked you.

1258
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:20,240
来啦
Incoming!

1259
01:35:28,030 --> 01:35:29,070
着什么急
In a hurry?

1260
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:32,350
别逼我这么做
Don't make me do this.

1261
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:33,930
那好
Okay.

1262
01:35:49,770 --> 01:35:51,120
快点  吃了他们
Come on, do your thing!

1263
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:53,280
来啊
Come on!

1264
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:56,790
来啊
Come on!

1265
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,110
真是的  咕咕
Damn it, Goose.

1266
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:02,810
选好边吧
Pick a side.

1267
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:08,370
把他们也带去机库
Take them to the hangar, too.

1268
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:10,540
我们把他们都丢进太空
We'll blast them all into space.

1269
01:36:12,930 --> 01:36:14,000
别激动
Play it cool.

1270
01:36:15,430 --> 01:36:16,720
就像在哈瓦那时那样
Just like Havana.

1271
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:19,700
你拿到那东西了吗
Do you have the thing?

1272
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:22,180
被噬元兽猫吃了
Flerken kitty ate it.

1273
01:36:35,770 --> 01:36:36,850
快走
Come on, move!

1274
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:38,010
快走
Move!

1275
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:40,020
看我的行事
Follow my lead.

1276
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:45,650
遮住她的眼睛
Cover her eyes.

1277
01:36:54,230 --> 01:36:55,310
上船
Onto the ship!

1278
01:36:55,450 --> 01:36:56,710
快走  快走
Let's go! Let's go!

1279
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:21,960
好个移花接木
Nice diversion.

1280
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:24,260
我真以为我放进去了
I could have swore I put it in there.

1281
01:38:21,250 --> 01:38:23,470
米涅瓦  开战机击落他们
Minn-Erva, take them down in the drop ship.

1282
01:38:23,470 --> 01:38:24,530
好的
On it.

1283
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:30,430
你没事吧  朋友
You all right, friend?

1284
01:38:31,210 --> 01:38:33,310
好极了
Never better.

1285
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:39,980
有敌机追来了
We got a bogey coming in hot.

1286
01:40:19,510 --> 01:40:20,670
好啊
Yes!

1287
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:43,240
那是什么鬼
What the hell was that?

1288
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,770
发射弹道导弹弹头
Deploy ballistic warheads.

1289
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,370
这不可能
That's impossible.

1290
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,880
C53没有能摧毁我们弹头的
C-53 doesn't have a defense system

1291
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,640
足够先进的防御系统
advanced enough to destroy our warheads.

1292
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:11,640
那不是他们的防御系统  罗南
That's not their defense system, Ronan.

1293
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:17,230
干掉她
Take her down.

1294
01:43:27,830 --> 01:43:29,520
回跳跃点
Return to the jump point.

1295
01:43:30,790 --> 01:43:32,640
我们改日再回来带走武器
We'll be back for the weapon.

1296
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:35,490
能量核吗
The core?

1297
01:43:37,490 --> 01:43:38,530
是她
The woman.

1298
01:44:26,830 --> 01:44:28,230
我真为你骄傲
I'm so proud of you.

1299
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:31,540
自那天
You've come a long way

1300
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:33,930
我在湖边发现你  你进步了好多
since I found you that day by the lake.

1301
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:36,270
但你能克制住你的情绪
But can you keep your emotions in check

1302
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:38,080
直到打败我吗
long enough to take me on?

1303
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,310
还是你仍会如以往那样被情绪左右
Or will they get the better of you as always?

1304
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:44,590
我一直对你说
I always told you...

1305
01:44:44,910 --> 01:44:45,930
等你可以
you'll be ready

1306
01:44:45,930 --> 01:44:48,820
凭自身实力打倒我  你就真准备好了
the day you can knock me down as yourself.

1307
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:50,500
这一刻终于来了
This is that moment.

1308
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:52,900
这就是见分晓的时刻  弗斯
This is that moment, Vers!

1309
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:54,660
停下那些花里胡哨的
Turn off the light show...

1310
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:58,330
向我证明  你可以光明正大地打败我...
and prove to me you can beat me without...

1311
01:45:13,310 --> 01:45:15,230
我不用向你证明什么
I have nothing to prove to you.

1312
01:45:31,150 --> 01:45:33,030
目的地  哈拉
Destination: Hala.

1313
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,060
我不能空手而归
I can't go back empty-handed.

1314
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:36,620
你不会空手而归
You won't be empty-handed.

1315
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:38,650
我会让你带句话回去
I'm sending you with a message.

1316
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:42,200
告诉至高智慧  我会去终结一切
Tell the Supreme Intelligence that I'm coming to end it.

1317
01:45:42,730 --> 01:45:46,230
战争  谎言  所有一切
The war. The lies. All of it.

1318
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:48,950
你不能那么做
You can't do this.

1319
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:10,600
真悬啊  是吧  咕咕
That was a close call, huh, Goosey?

1320
01:46:12,490 --> 01:46:14,490
那些坏蛋还在你里面吗
Those bad guys still in there somewhere?

1321
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:16,690
我的噬元兽啊
Mother Flerken!

1322
01:46:16,690 --> 01:46:18,020
-你没事吧  -嗯
- You okay? - Yeah.

1323
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:19,540
就是抓了一下而已
It's just a scratch.

1324
01:46:19,950 --> 01:46:21,330
不
No.

1325
01:46:29,610 --> 01:46:32,280
真不敢相信你卷入了一场最酷的肉搏战
I can't believe you got in the raddest dogfight ever...

1326
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:33,300
而我没看到
and I missed it.

1327
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:35,150
要我说  你到的正是时候
I'd say you arrived just in time.

1328
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:37,430
你飞得真的很漂亮
Some nifty flying you did out there.

1329
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:39,750
神盾局总是需要你这样的好飞行员
S.H.I.E.L.D. could always use a good pilot like you.

1330
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:41,260
我会考虑的
I'll consider it...

1331
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:44,430
只要你不再说我的飞行"漂亮"
as long as you never call my flying "nifty" again.

1332
01:46:44,990 --> 01:46:46,150
你的眼睛怎么样了
How's your eye?

1333
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:48,120
每秒都在愈合
Getting better every second.

1334
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:49,570
我想问清楚
Just so I'm clear...

1335
01:46:49,910 --> 01:46:51,290
索拉
you were Soh-Larr...

1336
01:46:51,290 --> 01:46:53,790
-和那个神盾特工都是你  -凯勒
- and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent? - Keller.

1337
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:56,480
他把我上司绑了起来  盗用了他的身份
He tied my boss up, stole his identity.

1338
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:59,490
我只是借了他的脸  我不是贼
I borrowed his likeness. I'm no thief.

1339
01:46:59,490 --> 01:47:00,980
是有点像盗窃
It is a little like stealing.

1340
01:47:01,130 --> 01:47:02,580
你是谁那边的
Whose side are you on here?

1341
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:04,300
你康复前都可以在这里养伤
You're good to go here until you recover...

1342
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:07,340
但你和你家人得换副新模样
but you and your family are gonna need a new look.

1343
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:09,350
我可以继续做你上司
I could go back to being your boss.

1344
01:47:09,550 --> 01:47:10,240
千万别
Please don't.

1345
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:13,300
怎么了  我喜欢他那双漂亮的蓝眼睛
Come on. I loved sporting his beautiful blue eyes.

1346
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:15,740
说什么呢  你们的眼睛最漂亮了
No way. You guys have the best eyes.

1347
01:47:15,970 --> 01:47:18,020
-永远别变你的眼睛  -她的眼睛是很美
- Don't ever change your eyes. - She has beautiful eyes.

1348
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:18,950
多谢你了
That's very sweet of you.

1349
01:47:18,950 --> 01:47:20,960
我想努力不慌乱
I was trying not to panic...

1350
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:22,850
我会帮你们找到家的
I'll help you find a home.

1351
01:47:23,860 --> 01:47:25,610
完成玛威尔的心愿
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

1352
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:29,300
他们可以跟我们住这儿
They can stay here with us.

1353
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:30,460
不是吗  妈妈
Can't they, Mom?

1354
01:47:31,090 --> 01:47:32,900
他们在这里不安全的  宝贝
They won't be safe here, baby.

1355
01:47:33,670 --> 01:47:35,080
卡罗尔阿姨是对的
Auntie Carol's right.

1356
01:47:35,630 --> 01:47:36,920
他们得有自己的家
They need their own home.

1357
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:39,410
我很快就会回来
I'll be back before you know it.

1358
01:47:40,350 --> 01:47:43,010
或许我可以飞上天  跟你碰头
Or maybe I could fly up and meet you halfway?

1359
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:45,830
那你得学会像卡罗尔阿姨那样发光
Only if you learn to glow like your Auntie Carol.

1360
01:47:45,830 --> 01:47:47,680
或许我可以建艘飞船
Or maybe I'll build a spaceship.

1361
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,760
-你又说不准  -是啊
- You don't know. - He doesn't.

1362
01:47:59,190 --> 01:48:01,490
把宇宙魔方留在地球上
Keep the Tesseract on Earth.

1363
01:48:02,290 --> 01:48:03,240
藏好
Hidden.

1364
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:05,490
你确定那是马威会想要的吗
You sure that's what Marvel would want?

1365
01:48:06,190 --> 01:48:07,440
是玛威尔
Mar-Vell.

1366
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:08,810
我就那么说的
That's what I said.

1367
01:48:08,860 --> 01:48:11,440
是两个词  玛  威尔
It's two words. Mar. Vell.

1368
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:12,760
玛威尔
Mar-Vell.

1369
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:13,990
"马威"听上去好多了
"Marvel" sounds a lot better.

1370
01:48:13,990 --> 01:48:15,700
就像惊艳合唱团
You know, like the Marvelettes.

1371
01:48:29,330 --> 01:48:30,550
没印象吗
Not ringing any bells?

1372
01:48:30,550 --> 01:48:32,450
继续唱  或许我会想起来
Keep singing. Maybe it'll come back to me.

1373
01:48:47,780 --> 01:48:49,250
我给它升级了
I upgraded it.

1374
01:48:49,890 --> 01:48:52,750
信号范围能至少覆盖几个星系了
Range should be a couple galaxies, at least.

1375
01:48:55,180 --> 01:48:57,450
怎么  你觉得我会给你打骚扰电话吗
What? You think I'm gonna crank call you?

1376
01:48:57,450 --> 01:49:00,620
仅限紧急情况
For emergencies only, okay?

1377
01:49:07,030 --> 01:49:08,080
好吧
Well...

1378
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,780
如果你再路过这个星系
if you're ever passing back through this galaxy...

1379
01:49:10,850 --> 01:49:12,580
务必喊我一声
be sure to give a brother a shout.

1380
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:31,360
我们洗干净了番茄酱的污迹
We got the ketchup stain off.

1381
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,660
谢谢  捣蛋中尉
Thanks, Lieutenant Trouble.

1382
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:50,010
我也不愿意道别
It's hard for me to say goodbye, too.

1383
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:05,440
去吧
Go on.

1384
01:51:05,590 --> 01:51:07,970
{\an8}{\pos(202.8,92.267)}保护者计划

1385
01:51:12,690 --> 01:51:14,080
很高兴你回来了  长官
Glad to have you back, sir.

1386
01:51:14,570 --> 01:51:15,670
这是寄给您的
This came for you.

1387
01:51:20,250 --> 01:51:21,470
是真的吗
So, is it true?

1388
01:51:22,420 --> 01:51:23,890
克里人烧毁了你的眼睛
That the Kree burned your eye out...

1389
01:51:23,890 --> 01:51:26,170
因为你不肯交出宇宙魔方
because you refused to give them the Tesseract?

1390
01:51:27,270 --> 01:51:31,320
我既不能承认也不能否认这种说法
I will neither confirm nor deny the facts of that story.

1391
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:32,400
明白
Understood.

1392
01:51:33,910 --> 01:51:34,650
很遗憾
I'm sorry to report

1393
01:51:34,660 --> 01:51:36,210
我们仍尚未找到宇宙魔方
that we still haven't found the Tesseract.

1394
01:51:36,210 --> 01:51:38,150
它肯定会出现的
I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.

1395
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:41,460
等出现了我会通知您的
I'll let you know when it does.

1396
01:51:41,810 --> 01:51:42,900
然后呢
Then what?

1397
01:51:44,060 --> 01:51:45,040
长官
Sir?

1398
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:49,270
我们完全不知道还存在怎样的跨星系威胁
We have no idea what other intergalactic threats are out there.

1399
01:51:49,370 --> 01:51:51,460
而我们的单人女子保安
And our one-woman security force

1400
01:51:51,470 --> 01:51:54,810
还要优先处理宇宙另一边的问题
had a prior commitment on the other side of the universe.

1401

一直以来  我的原则都是做正确的事

我以为自己可以回归军队
And I thought I could throw myself back in

299
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,980

我留下来  一半是因为听说你参与创办了神盾局
Knowing that you helped found S.H.I.E.L.D is half the reason I stay.

如果尼克·弗瑞觉得派他的扮装男

330
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,780
和突击队处理好他惹的麻烦就行了
and S.T.R.I.K.E commandos to mop-up his mess,

331
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,410
那他是大错特错  此次失利不能容忍
he's sadly mistaken. This failure is unacceptable.

332
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,630
鉴于袭击就发生在
Well, considering this attack took place one mile

333
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,220
我国海域一英里外
from my country's sovereign waters,

334
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,950
恐怕这样还不够  我提议立刻开听证会
it's a bit more then that. I move for immediate hearing.

335
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,710
我们不需要听证会  需要行动
We don't need hearings, we need action.

336
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,390
理事会的责任就是监管神盾局
It's this Council's duty to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D.

337
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,480
这样的失守引出了许多疑问
A breach like this raises serious questions.

338
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,260
比如一个法国海盗
Like how the hell did a French pirate

00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:37,350
是怎么在光天化日下劫持了神盾局的机密军舰
manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D vessel in broad daylight?

340
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,530
申明一下  理事
For the record, councilman,

341
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,600

344
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,880

345
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,240

是吗
Really?

347
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,760
我倒不在乎
I don't.

348
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,080
我不在乎一船一舰
I don't care about one boat,

349
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,160
我在乎整个舰队
I care about the fleet.

350
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,730
如果理事会遇到点小事
If this council is going to fold a rancor every time

351
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,010
就要大肆抱怨一番
someone pushes us on the playing field,

352
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,010
那或许也该找人监管我们了
maybe we need someone to oversee us.

353
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,560
部长先生  我们不是说...
Mr. Secretary, nobody is suggesting...

354
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,930
失陪一下
Excuse me.

355
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,610

那要看你怎么定义麻烦
It depends on your definition.

357
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,830
我们办公室只隔了四十层
I work forty floors away

358
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,550
没人劫船你都不肯来吗

359
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,480
核战爆发我也会来的

用钱都能解决

我希望你能组织一次投票
I want you to call for a vote.

洞察计划需要延后
Project Insight has to be delayed.

365
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,940
尼克  这不是小忙
Nick, that's not a favor,

366
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,580
这需要小组委员会开慢长的听证会
that's a subcommittee hearing. A long one.

367
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,690
或许也没什么问题
It could be nothing, probably is nothing.

368
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:55,430
可我得确保万无一失
I just need time to make sure it's nothing.

369

00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,720
那我们都该庆幸
Then we'll both be damn glad

371

没把天空航母送上天
those Helicarriers aren't in the air.

372

Fine.

但你得让钢铁侠参加我侄女的生日派对
But you gotta get Iron Man to stop by my niece's birthday party.

谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

375
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,330
路过不算数  得好好玩会儿

376
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,400
问题是  我觉得情况在恶化

383
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,370
想好要怎么承担是我们的事
It's our job to figure out how to carry it.

384
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,470
是装在箱子里
Is it gonna be in a big suitcase

385
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,770
还是放在钱包里
or in a little man-purse?

386
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,020
取决于你自己
It's up to you.

387
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,060

我纠结了好一阵寻找一个留在那的理由

403

但回归正常生活还是开心的吧

尼克  你不能这样  不能死

536
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,440
娜塔莎

537

娜塔莎
Natasha!

538
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:42,220
弗瑞怎么会去你家
Why was Fury in your apartment?

539
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,000
我也不知道
I don't know.

540
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,260
队长  他们叫你回神盾局
Captain, they want you back at S.H.I.E.L.D.

541
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,410
好的  稍等
Yeah, give me a second.

542
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,370
他们让你立刻回去
They want you now.

543
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,130
知道了
Okay.

544
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,530
你真不会说谎
You're a terrible liar.

545
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,470
突击队立刻护送罗杰斯队长
S.T.R.I.K.E team escort Captain Rogers

546
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,350
返回神盾局
back to S.H.I.E.L.D immediately.

547
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:08,850
我跟他说了
I told him.

548
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,120
我们走
Let's go.

549
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,840
好
Yeah.

550
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,810
突击队  出发
S.T.R.I.K.E, move it out.

551
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,950
无论结果如何  你尽力了
For whatever it's worth, you did your best.

552
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,250
谢谢您  长官
Thank you, sir.

553
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,020
罗杰斯队长
Captain Rogers.

554
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,820
邻居
Neighbor.

555
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,900
队长  我是亚历山大·皮尔斯
Ah, Captain. I'm Alexander Pierce.

556
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,600
长官  很荣幸见到你
Sir, it's an honor.

557
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,780
感到荣幸的应该是我  队长
The honor is mine, Captain.

558
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,300
我父亲是101空降师的  进来吧
My father served in the 101st. Come on in.

559
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,260
那张照片是我和尼克认识五年后拍的
That photo was taken five years after Nick and I met,

560
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,200
那时我在哥伦比亚国务院
when I was at State Department in Bogota.

561
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,480
哥伦比亚民族解放军占领使馆后
ELN rebels took the embassy,

562
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,430
警卫帮我逃了出来
and security got me out,

563
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,950
但是叛军抓走了人质
but the rebels took hostages.

564
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:07,460
尼克是神盾局当地站点的二把手
Nick was deputy chief for the S.H.I.E.L.D station there.

565
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,970
他提出了一个计划
And he comes to me with a plan.

566
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,250
要通过下水道进行突袭
He wants to storm the building through the sewers.

567
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,900
我说  不行  我们会谈判的
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

568
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,760
结果是  叛军不跟我们谈判
Turned out the ELN didn't negotiate,

569
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,400
于是下令格杀勿论
so they put out a kill order.

570
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,140
他们冲进了地下室
They stormed the basement,

571
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,390
结果发现了什么呢  那里空了
and what did they find? They find it empty.

572
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,450
尼克违抗了我的直接命令
Nick had ignored my direct order

573
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:29,310
在外国境内  擅自采取了军事行动
and carried out an unauthorized military operation on foreign soil.

574
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,310
营救了十几名政府官员
He saved the lives of a dozen political officers,

575
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,560
还有我的女儿
including my daughter.

576
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,890
所以你提拔了他
So you gave him a promotion.

577
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,070
而且从未后悔过
I've never had any cause to regret it.

578
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,390
队长  尼克昨晚为什么去你家
Captain, why was Nick in your apartment last night?

579
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,110
我不知道
I don't know.

580
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:48,730
你知道那里被监听了吗
You know it was bugged?

581
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,840
知道  还是尼克告诉我的
I did, because Nick told me.

582
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,530
那他告诉你是他监听的了吗
Did he tell you he was the one who bugged it?

583
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,010
我给你看样东西
I want you to see something.

584
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,210
巴托克  是谁雇了你
Who hired you, Batroc?

585
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:06,770
这是直播吗
Is that live?

586
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,000
是的  他们昨晚在阿尔及尔
Yeah, they picked him up last night

587
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,740
一个不够安全的安全屋抓到了他
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

588
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,780
你是说他是嫌犯
Are you saying he's a suspect?

589
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,770
巴托克可不做暗杀
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

590
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:16,960
不是他  事情要更复杂些
No, it's more complicated than that.

591
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,630
巴托克受匿名人士雇佣
Batroc was hired anonymously

592
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,400
袭击雷姆利亚星号
to attack the Lemurian Star

593
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:21,910
他们通过电子邮件联系
and he was contacted by e-mail

594
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,780
用电汇付款
and paid by wire transfer.

595
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,660
之后这笔钱经过了
And then the money was run through

596
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,980
17个虚假账户转账
seventeen fictitious accounts,

597
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,850
最后转给一家控股公司
the last one going to a holding company

598
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:33,270
公司注册者叫雅各布·维奇
that was registered to a Jacob Veech.

599
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:34,910
我应该认识他吗
Am I supposed to know who that is?

600
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,140
不应该  维奇六年前就死了
Not likely. Veech died six years ago.

601
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,240
他最后的地址是
His last address was

602
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,610
埃尔姆赫斯特大街1435号
14-35 Elmhurst Drive.

603
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,990
我第一次见尼克时
When I first met Nick

604
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,990
他母亲住在1437号
his mother lived at 14-37.

605
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,180
你的意思是弗瑞雇了海盗吗
Are you saying Fury hired the pirates?

606
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:49,440
为什么呢
Why?

607
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,000
大部分人的看法
Well the prevailing theory

608
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,280
是劫持事件只是在掩盖
was that the hijacking was a cover

609
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,440
机密情报的交易
for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence.

610
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,440
交易出了岔  结果尼克送了命
The sale went sour and that led to Nick's death.

611
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:06,900
如果你真了解尼克·弗瑞
If you really knew Nick Fury

612
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,120
就该知道这不可能
you know that's not true.

613
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:10,970
不然我为什么找你来
Why do you think we're talking?

614
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,700
你知道吗  我在理事会工作
See, I took a seat on the Council

615
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,590
不是我愿意  而是应尼克的请求
not because I wanted to but because Nick asked me to,

616
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,760
因为我们都十分现实
because we were both realists.

617
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:25,590
我们知道  除去那些
We knew that despite all the diplomacy

618
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,460
外交手腕和官样文章
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

619
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,540
想建立更美好的新世界
that to build a really better world

620
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,090
有时需要摧毁旧世界
sometimes means having to tear the old one down.

621
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,310
而这样难免树敌
And that makes enemies.

622
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,500
他们会说你无耻肮脏
Those people that call you dirty

623
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,070
因为你能狠下心做见不得人的事
because you got the guts to stick your hands in the mud

624
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,410
好创造更美好的事物
and try to build something better.

625
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:50,500
一想到那些人今天会拍手称快
And the idea that those people could be happy today,

626
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:54,340
就让我非常恼火
makes me really, really angry.

627
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,940
队长  你是尼克生前见到的最后一人
Captain, you were the last one to see Nick alive.

628
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,300
我认为这绝非巧合
I don't think that's an accident,

629
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,040
我想你也这样觉得
and I don't think you do either.

630
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,810
所以我再问你一次
So I'm gonna ask again,

631
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:10,690
他为什么会去你那
why was he there?

632
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,830
他告诉我不要相信任何人
He told me not to trust anyone.

633
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,760
也包括他吗
I wonder if that included him.

634
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,630
抱歉  那是他的遗言
I'm sorry. Those were his last words.

635
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,120
失陪
Excuse me.

636
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,570
队长
Captain.

637
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,160
有人杀害了我的朋友  我必须查明原委
Somebody murdered my friend and I'm gonna find out why.

638
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:43,040
挡我路的  我都会让他后悔
Anyone gets in my way, they're gonna regret it.

639
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:45,090
无论是谁

they want us to see.

00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:57,640

派遣突击队至25楼
Mobilize S.T.R.I.K.E units, 25th floor.

666
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,680
别激动  大个子
Woh, big guy.

667
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:48,230
我就想说  队长  这不是针对你
I just want you to know, Cap, this ain't personal.

668
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,050
感觉就是针对我
It kind of feels personal.

669
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,300
放下盾牌  举起双手
Drop the shield! Put your hands in the air!

670
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,090
投降吧  罗杰斯
Give it up, Rogers!

671
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:30,550
把门打开
Get that door open!

672
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:32,650
你无路可逃了
You have nowhere to go!

673
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,460
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

674
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,080
他往车库去了  封闭大桥
He's headed for the garage. Lock down the bridge!

675
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:10,630
罗杰斯队长  立刻投降
Stand down, Captain Rogers. Stand down.

676
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:13,140
重复  立刻投降
Repeat, stand down.

677
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,370
都听好了
Eyes here.

678
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:53,100
无论手头上有什么事  都推掉
Whatever your op is, bury it.

679
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,820
现在是一级戒备
This is level one.

680
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,900
通知交通部  特区的路口全部亮红灯
Contact DOT. All traffic lights in the district go red.

681
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:03,120
封锁附近机场所有跑道
Shut all runways at BWI, IAD and Reagan.

682
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,640
将市区里的所有监控摄像头
All security cameras in the city

683
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,640
调到这个显示屏上

685
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:12,260
电话  电脑  平板  能查的都查
Phones, computers, PDA's, whatever.

686
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,620
有人发推特提到他  我也要知道
If someone Tweets about this guy, I want to know about it.

687
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,550
恕我直言
With all due respect,

688
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,560
如果神盾局要追捕美国队长
If S.H.I.E.L.D is conducting a manhunt for Captain America,

689
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,880
我们有权知道原因
we deserve to know why.

690
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,580
因为他骗了我们
Because he lied to us.

691
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:27,860
罗杰斯队长知道弗瑞局长之死的内情
Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury,

692
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,310
却不愿告诉我们
he refused to share it.

693
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:33,080
我知道大家很难接受
As difficult as this is to accept,

694
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,710
但美国队长现在是神盾局的逃犯
Captain America is a fugitive from S.H.I.E.L.D.

695
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:05,740
-哪去了  -安全的地方
- Where is it? - Safe.

696
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:06,480
具体点
Do better!

697
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,510
你哪里弄来的
Where did you get it?

698
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,780
凭什么告诉你
Why would I tell you?

699
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:10,990
弗瑞为什么要给你
Fury gave it to you. Why?

700
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:12,010
里面是什么
What's on it?

701
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:12,680
我不知道
I don't know.

702
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,780
别说谎
Stop lying!

703
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:16,430
我只是摆出什么都知道的样子  罗杰斯
I only act like I know everything, Rogers.

704
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,210
你一定知道是弗瑞雇了海盗
I bet you knew Fury hired the pirates, didn't you?

705
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:20,600
那倒是说得通
Well, it makes sense.

706
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,040
那艘船有问题  你和弗瑞都得想办法上去
The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.

707
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,790
别让我再问你第二遍
I'm not gonna ask you again.

708
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,710
我知道是谁杀了弗瑞
I know who killed Fury.

709
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,870
多数情报机构不相信他的存在
Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists,

710
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:36,720
相信的称他为冬日战士
the ones who do call him the Winter Soldier.

711
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:39,130
在过去的五十年里  他参与了二十多起
He's credited with over two dozen assassinations

712
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:41,420
暗杀事件
in the last fifty years.

713
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,040
那他是个鬼故事咯
So he's a ghost story.

714
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,650
五年前  我护送一个核武器工程师离开伊朗
Five years ago I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran,

715
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,200
快到敖德萨时  有人射穿了我的轮胎
somebody shot at my tires near Odessa.

716
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,030
车失控掉下悬崖  我们逃了出来
We lost control, went straight over a cliff, I pulled us out,

717
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,180
但冬日战士也在那里
but the Winter Soldier was there.

718
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,950
见我挡着  他就一枪打穿了我  杀了工程师
I was covering my engineer, so he shot him straight through me.

719
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:05,560
前苏联子弹  没有膛线  穿不了比基尼了
A Soviet slag, no rifling. Bye-bye bikinis.

720
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,380
你现在穿比基尼一定很丑
Yeah, I bet you look terrible in them now.

721
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:13,730
追踪他是没用的  我试过
Going after him is a dead end. I know, I've tried.

722
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,690
像你说的  他就是个鬼故事
Like you said, he's a ghost story.

723
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,440
那就看看这个鬼到底想要什么
Well, let's find out what the ghost wants.

724
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,150
尼克·弗瑞被残忍地谋杀了
Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood.

725
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,810
但凡是个正常人
To any reasonable person,

726
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:30,610
都会说他是烈士  而非叛徒
that would make him a martyr, not a traitor.

727
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:32,190
知道他怎么是叛徒了吗
You know what makes him a traitor?

728
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:34,870
他让雇佣兵劫持自己的船
Hiring a mercenary to hijack his own ship.

729
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:37,120
尼克·弗瑞利用与你的交情

730
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,240
强迫理事会延迟洞察计划
to coerce this council into delaying Project Insight.

731
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,050
他知道这个计划会暴露他的非法行动
A project he knew would expose his own illegal operations.

732
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:44,830
说好听点  他骗了你
At best, he lied to you.

733
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:48,170
-说句不好听的  -你们是让我引咎辞职吗
- At worst... - Are you calling for my resignation?

734
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,920
我现在就可以写辞呈
I've got a pen and paper right here.

735
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,890
这个我们可以迟点讨论
That discussion can be tabled for a later time.

736
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:55,580
你们还真想让我辞职
But you do want to have a discussion.

737
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,840
我们已经谈过了  部长先生
We've already had it, Mr. Secretary.

738
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:03,290
理事会决定立即重启洞察计划
This council moves to immediately reactivate Project Insight.

739
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:07,940
你要是想耍嘴皮子  赶紧趁现在
If you want to say something snappy, now would be a good time.

740
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:17,230
逃亡第一准则  只能走不能跑
First rule of going on the run is, don't run, walk.

741
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:20,360
如果穿着这双鞋跑  早就掉下来了
If I run in these shoes, they're gonna fall off.

742
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:24,870
这个U盘拥有六级定位系统
The drive has a level six homing program,

743
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:27,750
一旦启动  神盾局就能定位我们
so as soon as we boot up S.H.I.E.L.D will know exactly where we are.

744
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,040
我们有多长时间
How much time do we have?

745
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:32,210
九分钟吧  现在
About nine minutes from...

746
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:33,940
开始
Now.

747
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,170
弗瑞的猜测是对的
Fury was right about that ship,

748
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,110
有人想在那艘船上藏东西

749
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,300

这个U盘被某种人工智能保护着

751
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:48,250
一直在重新编程  抵抗我的指令
it keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands.

752
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,480
你能破解吗
Can you override it?

753
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:53,300
开发这个程序的人比我聪明点
The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me.

754
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,680
就那么一点
Slightly.

755
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,160
我要试试追踪程序
I'm gonna try running a tracer.

756
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:09,190
这是神盾局用来
This is a program that S.H.I.E.L.D

757
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:10,910
追踪恶意软件的程序
developed to track hostile malware,

758
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:14,020
就算我们读不到文件
so if we can't read the file,

759
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,170
也许可以查到它的来源
maybe we can find out where it came from.

760
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:17,790
有什么可以帮到你们的吗
Can I help you guys with anything?

761
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:18,700

你搭南边的扶梯去地铁站

闭嘴  搂着我  笑两声

00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:06,390
美国队长从哪学的偷车

Alright, I have a question for you,

801

你可以不回答
of which you do not have to answer.

802
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,210
不过我觉得如果你不回答
I feel like if you don't answer it though,

803
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:21,390
也算是回答了
you're kind of answering it, you know?

804
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,020
什么问题
What?

805

Was that your first kiss since 1945?

806
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:25,870
有那么糟吗
That bad, huh?

807
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:26,610
我可没那么说
I didn't say that.

808
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,400
听起来就是那个意思
Well, it kind of sounds like that's what you're saying.

809
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,380
不是  我只是好奇你练习过几次
No, I didn't. I just wondered how much practice you had.

810
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:33,500
-我不需要练习  -每个人都需要
- I don't need practice. - Everybody needs practice.

811
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,000
那不是我自1945年来的第一次接吻
It was not my first kiss since 1945.

812
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:38,050
我是95岁了  可我不是死人
I'm ninety-five, I'm not dead.

813
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,790
没遇到过特别的人吗
Nobody special, though?

814
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:42,680
不管你信不信
Believe it or not,

815
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,630
要找个和我有类似人生经历的人不太容易
it's kind of hard to find someone with shared life experience.

816
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,540
管他的  你随便编个故事就好了
Well, that's alright, you just make something up.

817
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:48,780
像你一样吗
What, like you?

818
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:51,160
我不知道  说实话也要看情况
I don't know. The truth is a matter of circumstances,

819
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:54,000
不能对谁都掏心窝
it's not all things to all people all the time.

820
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:56,230
我也是
And neither am I.

821
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:58,160
这样活着很累
That's a tough way to live.

822
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,920
但能保命
It's a good way not to die, though.

823
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,510
不了解一个人的本质
You know, it's kind of hard to trust someone

824
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:05,700
你怎么信任他
when you don't know who that someone really is.

825
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,390
对
Yeah.

826
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:11,960
你希望我是什么样的人
Who do you want me to be?

827

朋友怎么样
How about a friend?

828
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,130
我觉得你当初
Well, there's a chance you might be

829
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:20,940
是入错行了  罗杰斯
in the wrong business, Rogers.

830
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:37,980
是这儿吗
This is it?

831
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,640
文件就是从这儿发出的
The file came from these coordinates.

832
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,460
{\an8}里海营

833
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,550
我也来自这里
So did I.

834
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:54,110
我就是在这个营地受训的
This camp is where I was trained.

835
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,290
变化很大吗
Changed much?

836
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,460
还好
A little.

837
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,970
跟上  姑娘们
Pick up the pace, ladies!

838
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:08,080
快跑  加速
Let's go! Let's go! Double time!

839
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:11,390
快跑  罗杰斯  快点
Come on Rogers, move it!

840
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,980
快点  归队
Come on! Fall in!

841
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,810
罗杰斯  我说归队
Rogers! I said fall in!

842
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:23,760
这里没戏
This is a dead end.

843
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,910
没热成像  没信号  连无线电波都没有
Zero heat signature, zero waves, not even radio.

844
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,050
编写文件的人
Whoever wrote the file

845
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:31,320
应该用了路由器来摆脱追踪
must have used a router to throw people off.

846
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,030
怎么了
What is it?

847
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:36,150
按照军规  营房五百码范围内
Army regulations forbid storing ammunition

848
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,290
禁止存放弹药
within five hundred yards from the barracks.

849
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:40,730
这栋建筑不该建在这
This building is in the wrong place.

850
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,520
这是神盾局的地方
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.

851
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:00,590
可能就是在这成立的
Maybe where it started.

852
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:07,120
{\an8}国土战略防御攻击与后勤保障局

853

霍华德
Howard.

855

这姑娘是谁
Who's the girl?

856
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,100
在这么隐秘的地方工作
If you already working in a secret office

857
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,380
为什么还要藏着电梯
why do you need to hide the elevator?

858
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:54,550
数据源不可能在这里  这些都是老古董了
This can't be the data-point, this technology is ancient.

859

是否启动系统

860
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,930
输入  是
Y-E-S, spells yes.

861
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:32,240
我们玩个游戏吧
"Shall we play a game?"

862
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:35,960
-这是一部电影[1933《战争游戏》]的台词  -我看过
- It's from a movie that... - Yeah, I saw it.

863
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,450

这是录像吧
It's some kind of a recording.

868
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,250
我才不是录像  女士
I am not a recording, Fraulein.

869
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,390
虽然我已经不是

1945年队长抓到我时的样子
when the Captain took me prisoner in 1945,

871
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:06,980
但我是

872
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,320
你认识这玩意吗
Do you know this thing?

873
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:16,280
阿尔宁·佐拉是红骷髅手下的德国科学家

874
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:17,690

875
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:20,420
纠正第一点  我是瑞士人

876
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:22,890
第二点  看看周围

877
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:26,170
我活得生龙活虎

01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:30,710
1972年  我被确诊患有绝症
In 1972 I received a terminal diagnosis.

879
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:35,660
科学拯救不了我的身体  但我的思想
Science could not save my body, my mind, however,

880
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:37,900
值得留存
that was worth saving

881
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:41,840
于是存在了这20万单元的数据库中
on two hundred thousand feet of data banks.

882
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:45,720
你们就在我的大脑里
You are standing in my brain.

九头蛇创立时的信条
Hydra was founded on the belief

894
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:17,410
是人类不能掌控自身的自由
that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom.

895
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:19,460
可我们没意识到
What we did not realize,

896
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:23,500
若去夺走自由  他们会反抗
was that if you try to take that freedom, they resist.

897
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:20,290
{\an8}领导我们  元首

898
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:21,720
{\an8}我们甘愿追随  九头蛇万岁

906

毫无意义

929
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:33,310
刚才我说到
As I was saying...

930
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,580

洞察计划
Project Insight

932
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:41,950
需要洞察力  所以我编写了一个算法

认命吧  这样也是对你好

真抱歉  我们需要避避风头

怎么了
What's going on?

966
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:06,860
我当初加入神盾局的时候

967
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:08,560
还以为是走上了正路
I thought it was going straight.

968
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:15,960
结果也就是从克格勃换到了九头蛇
But I guess I just traded in the KGB for Hydra.

969
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:24,330
我本以为知道我在为谁撒谎  但...
I thought I knew whose lies I was telling, but...

970
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:29,620
现在我也分不清了
I guess I can't tell the difference anymore.

971
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:33,620
你可能是入错行了
There's a chance you might be in the wrong business.

972
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:39,850
我欠你个人情
I owe you.

973
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,390
没什么
It's okay.

974
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:44,480
换成是我
If it was the other way around,

975
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:47,850
你的命攥在我手里
and it was down to me to save your life,

976
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:49,530
说实话
and you be honest with me,

977
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:53,380
你会把性命托付给我吗
would you trust me to do it?

978
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:57,000
现在会了
I would now.

979
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:01,030
我从不说谎
And I'm always honest.

980
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:04,540
你刚发现自己白牺牲了一次
Well, you seem pretty chipper for someone

981
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:06,520
还能这么乐观
who just found out they died for nothing.

982
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:11,020
我知道对手是谁就很开心了
Well, I guess I just like to know who I'm fighting.

983
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:12,690
我做了早饭
I made breakfast.

984
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:16,010
你们吃人间烟火吧
If you guys eat that sort of thing.

985
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:18,810
问题是
So, the question is:

986
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:21,510
神盾局里有谁有能力在境内发射导弹
who in S.H.I.E.L.D could launch a domestic missile strike?

987
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:24,200
皮尔斯
Pierce.

988
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:25,130
他碰巧正坐在
Who happens to be sitting

989
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:27,200
全世界最安全的大楼顶层
on top of the most secure building in the world.

990
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,330
但他不是孤军奋战
But he's not working alone,

991
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:31,230
佐拉的算法在雷姆利亚星号上
Zola's algorithm was on the Lemurian Star.

992
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,780
贾斯珀·西特韦尔也在上面
So was Jasper Sitwell.

993
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:38,070
所以关键问题是
So, the real question is:

994
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:40,170
两个华盛顿的头号通缉犯
how do the two most wanted people in Washington

995
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,770
怎么在光天化日下绑架神盾局官员
kidnap a S.H.I.E.L.D officer in broad daylight?

996
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:45,510
答案是  不需要绑架
The answer is: you don't.

997
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:46,990
这是什么
What's this?

998
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:48,220
算是简历吧
Call it a resume.

999
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:52,960
这是巴马拉吗
Is this Bakhmala?

1000
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:55,590
你参加了哈立德·汗迪尔任务
The Khalid Khandil mission, that was you.

1001
01:11:56,590 --> 01:11:58,400
你可没说他是空降救援
You didn't say he was a para-rescue.

1002
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:00,770
这是莱利吗
Is this Riley?

1003
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:01,880
对
Yeah.

1004
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,820
我听说因为有火箭弹  直升机飞不进去
I heard they couldn't bring in the choppers because of the RPGs.

1005
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:06,190
你们用的是什么  隐形降落伞吗
What did you use, a stealth chute?

1006
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:08,730
不  是这个
No. These.

1007
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:15,530
你不是说你是飞行员吗
I thought you said you're a pilot.

1008
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:17,270
我可没那么说
I never said a pilot.

1009
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,810
我不能请你帮忙  山姆
I can't ask you to do this, Sam.

1010
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,580
你退役是有原因的
You got out for a good reason.

1011
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:26,550
伙计  美国队长需要我帮忙
Dude, Captain America needs my help.

1012
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,520
这理由还不够吗
There's no better reason to get back in.

1013
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,900
这东西哪能拿到
Where can we get our hands on one of these things?

1014
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,650
最后一套在米德堡

1015
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:39,210
三道有守卫的门和一堵12英寸厚的钢墙后面
behind three guarded gates and a twelve-inch steel wall.

1016
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:42,770
应该没什么问题
Shouldn't be a problem.

1020
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:51,160
我得处理一下
and I gotta press the flesh.

1021
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,770
是哪位选民有问题吗  参议员先生
Any constituent in particular, Mr. Senator?

1022
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,860
不算是吧

不记得了  谁有心思听她说话
I don't know, who listens at that point?

1026
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:05,680
好像不是什么问题啊
Doesn't sound much of a problem to me.

1027
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:08,210
是吗  她要把我的背累坏了
Really? Cause she's killing my back.

1028
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:10,630
这地方不适合谈这些
Look, this isn't the place to talk about it.

1029

1049

我为什么要听你的
And why would I do that?

1050
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:12,080
因为那条领带看起来挺贵的
Because that tie looks really expensive,

1051

晕船了  一直在吐

你打算把我丢下屋顶吗

这可不是你的作风  罗杰斯

我还没法接受唇环
Yeah, I'm not ready for that.

1066

然后洞察计划的天空航母会除掉他们

一次解决几百万人

直接上天空航母

是他
It was him.

1119
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:49,560
他就这么看着我  却不认识我
He looked right at me and he didn't even know me.

1120
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:51,000
这怎么可能
How's that even possible?

1121
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,610
都过去七十年了
It was like seventy years ago.

1122
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:53,910
是佐拉干的
Zola.

1123
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,300
巴基所在的部队曾在1943年被俘
Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43,

1124
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:58,030
佐拉拿他们做过人体实验
Zola experimented on 'em.

1125
01:24:58,530 --> 01:25:00,670
可能就是因为这个  他摔下火车后活了下来
Whatever he did, it helped Bucky survive the fall.

1126
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:03,870
他们一定找到了他
They must have found him.

1127
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:05,690
这不是你的错  史蒂夫
None of that's your fault, Steve.

1128
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:11,290
我一无所有的时候  却还有巴基
Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.

1129
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,110
快找个医生过来
We need to get a doctor here.

1130
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:17,330
如果不压紧伤口
We don't put pressure on that wound

1131
01:25:17,330 --> 01:25:19,070
她会失血过多死在车上的
she's gonna bleed out here in the truck.

1132
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:29,160
这玩意压得我头疼
That thing was squeezing my brain.

1133
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:33,810
这人是谁
Who's this guy?

1134
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,010
三个坑  开挖吧
Three holes. Start digging.

1135
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:15,990
她中枪了  失血一品脱
GSW. She's lost at least a pint.

1136
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:16,810
也许有两品脱
Maybe two.

1137
01:26:16,810 --> 01:26:17,840
交给我吧
Let me take her!

1138
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,460
她会想先见见他的
She'll wants to see him first.

1139
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,300
终于来了
About damn time.

1140
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:36,880
脊柱损伤  胸骨断裂
Lacerated spinal column, cracked sternum,

1141
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:40,200
锁骨粉碎  肝穿孔
shattered collarbone, perforated liver,

1142
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:42,200
再加上要命的头疼
one hell of a headache.

1143
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,050
别忘了肺萎陷
Don't forget your collapsed lung.

1144
01:26:44,050 --> 01:26:47,700
对  这可不能忘了  除此之外都挺好
Oh, let's not forget that. Otherwise, I'm good.

1145
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:49,950
可他们给你做了开膛手术  你心跳都停了
They cut you open, your heart stopped.

1146
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:54,230
河豚毒素B  能把脉搏降到一分钟一下
Tetrodotoxin B. Slows the pulse to one beat a minute.

1147
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:56,290
班纳发明用来控制压力的
Banner developed it for stress.

1148
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:59,110
对他没多大作用  但我们发现了它的新用途
Didn't work so great for him, but we found a use for it.

1149
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:01,050
为什么要这么保密  为什么不告诉我们
Why all the secrecy? Why not just tell us?

1150
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:03,910
为了让意图谋害局长的人以为暗杀成功了
Any attempt on the director's life had to look successful.

1151
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:06,180
死人不能再被刺杀了
Can't kill you if you're already dead.

1152
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:11,000
另外  我也不知道还能相信谁
Besides, I wasn't sure who to trust.

1153
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:16,500
{\an8}银行

1154
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:27,650
巴恩斯中士
Sergeant Barnes...

1155
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:30,870
巴基  不
Bucky, no!

1156
01:27:34,150 --> 01:27:37,610
改造程序已经开始了
The procedure has already started.

1157
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:45,340
你将会成为九头蛇的新武器
You are to be the new face of Hydra.

1158
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:46,780
把他冷冻起来
Put him on ice.

1159
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:02,240
长官  他状态不稳定  情绪失常
Sir, he's...he's unstable. Erratic.

1160
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:17,510
任务汇报
Mission report.

1161
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,940
开始任务汇报
Mission report, now.

1162
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:36,110
桥上的那个人
The man on the bridge...

1163
01:28:39,150 --> 01:28:40,210
他是谁
Who was he?

1164
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,660
你这周早些时候执行另一个任务时见过他
You met him earlier this week on another assignment.

1165
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:48,490
我认识他
I knew him.

1166
01:28:57,190 --> 01:28:59,760
你做的事造福了全人类
Your work has been a gift to mankind.

1167
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:03,490
你塑造了这个世纪
You shaped this century,

1168
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:06,600
我需要你再做一次
and I need you to do it one more time.

1169
01:29:07,810 --> 01:29:11,330
人类社会正处在秩序与混乱的临界点
Society is at a tipping point between order and chaos.

1170
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,790
明天早上我们要帮他们抉择
Tomorrow morning we're gonna give it a push.

1171
01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:18,560
但如果你不完成你的任务  我就没法着手
But if you don't do your part, I can't do mine,

1172
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:23,610
九头蛇就没法还世界它应得的自由
and Hydra can't give the world the freedom it deserves.

1173
01:29:26,350 --> 01:29:27,600
可我认识他
But I knew him.

1174
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:35,570
给他准备
Prep him.

1175
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:38,880
他脱离低温冷冻太久了
He's been out of cryo-freeze too long.

1176
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:41,270
那就给他洗脑  重新来过
Then wipe him and start over.

1177
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:26,710
这个人拒绝了诺贝尔和平奖
This man declined the Nobel Peace Prize.

1178
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:26,310
{\an8}亚历山大·皮尔斯
参谋长联席会议

1179
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:30,630
他说  和平不是一项成就
He said, "Peace wasn't an achievement,

1180
01:30:30,910 --> 01:30:32,990
而是一种责任
it was a responsibility."

1181
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:37,940
就是这种事害我有信任危机
See, it's stuff like this that gives me trust issues.

1182
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,510
我们得阻止航母发射
We have to stop the launch.

1183
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:43,240
我觉得理事会不会再接我的电话了
I don't think the Council's accepting my calls anymore.

1184
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:46,410
这是什么
What's that?

1185
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:49,310
天空航母飞到三千英尺高后
Once the Helicarriers reach three thousand feet,

1186
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:51,670
会利用洞察卫星三角定位
they'll triangulate with Insight Satellites

1187
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:51,630
{\an8}洞察计划

1188
01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:53,550
变成杀伤性武器
becoming fully weaponized.

1189
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:55,220
我们必须渗入航母
We need to breach those carriers

1190
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:58,180
将上面的定位模块换成我们自己的
and replace their targeting blades with our own.

1191
01:30:58,180 --> 01:30:59,180
只换一两个没用
One or two won't cut it.

1192
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:01,980
必须把三艘航母都连接到一起
We need to link all three carriers for this to work,

1193
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:05,070
因为即使只剩一艘航母正常运转
because if even one of those ships remains operational

1194
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,420
还是会死很多人
a whole lot of people are gonna die.

1195
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:10,940
我们必须假设航母上的都是九头蛇的人
We have to assume everyone aboard those carriers is Hydra.

1196
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,040
我们得闯过他们那一关
We need to get pass them,

1197
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,710
把模块插进服务器  也许
insert the server blades, and maybe,

1198
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:16,250
只是也许  我们可以挽救
just maybe, we can salvage what's left...

1199
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:17,730
我们什么都不挽救
We're not salvaging anything.

1200
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:19,210
我们不止要摧毁航母  尼克
We're not just taking down the carriers, Nick,

1201
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:20,290
我们还要推翻神盾局
we're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.

1202
01:31:20,290 --> 01:31:21,730
神盾局跟此事无关
S.H.I.E.L.D had nothing to do with it.

1203
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:24,110
你把任务交给我  我就要这么做
You gave me this mission, this is how it ends.

1204
01:31:24,110 --> 01:31:25,120
神盾局有问题
S.H.I.E.L.D's been compromised,

1205
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,390
这是你的原话
you've said so yourself.

1206
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:28,400
九头蛇在就你眼皮底下发展  却没人发现
Hydra was right under your nose and nobody noticed.

1207
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,430
你以为我们为什么在这个山洞里见面
Why do you think we're meeting in this cave?

1208
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:31,720
因为我发现了
I noticed.

1209
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,900
在你发现之前有多少人付出了生命的代价
And how many paid the price before you did?

1210
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:38,590
我真的不知道巴恩斯的事
Look, I didn't know about Barnes.

1211
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:40,450
就算你知道  你会告诉我吗
Even if you have, would you have told me?

1212
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,820
还是继续你所谓的各司其职
Or would you have compartmentalized that too?

1213
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:47,840
神盾局  九头蛇  一个都不能留
S.H.I.E.L.D, Hydra, it all goes.

1214
01:31:48,430 --> 01:31:49,400
他说得对
He's right.

1215
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:56,630
别看我
Don't look at me.

1216
01:31:56,630 --> 01:31:58,760
他做什么我就做什么  就是比他慢点
I do what he does, just slower.

1217
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:03,230
好吧
Well...

1218
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:12,860
看来现在要由你来下令了  队长
Looks like you're giving the orders now, Captain.

1219
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:25,800
我们完事后找过你
We looked for you after.

1220
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:29,150
我父母想开车送你从墓地回家
My folks wanted to give you a ride from the cemetery.

1221
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:30,070
我知道  很抱歉
I know, I'm sorry.

1222
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:32,780
我只是  想一个人待一会儿
I just kind of wanted to be alone.

1223
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:35,030
葬礼怎么样
How was it?

1224
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:38,970
就那样吧  我妈葬在了我爸旁
It was okay. She's next to Dad.

1225
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:42,620
我想问你...
I was gonna ask...

1226
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:45,240
我知道你想问什么  巴基  只是我...
I know what you're gonna say, Buck, I just...

1227
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:48,550
我们可以像小时候那样  把沙发垫铺在地板上
We can put the couch cushion on the floor like when we were kids.

1228
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:51,320
那多好啊  你只要帮我擦擦鞋
It'll be fun. All you gotta do is shine my shoes,

1229
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:53,450
或者倒个垃圾什么的就行了
maybe take out the trash.

1230
01:32:58,870 --> 01:32:59,930
来吧
Come on.

1231
01:33:03,370 --> 01:33:06,930
谢谢  巴基  不过我自己能行
Thank you, Buck, but I can get by on my own.

1232
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:11,140
问题是  你不必这样
The thing is, you don't have to.

1233
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:16,790
我会陪你走到最后的  哥们
I'm with you till the end of the line, pal.

1234
01:33:19,450 --> 01:33:20,940
他一定会在那儿的
He's gonna be there, you know?

1235
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:22,260
我知道
I know.

1236
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,380
听着  不管他以前怎么样  现在的他
Look, whoever he used to be, the guy he is now,

1237
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:29,010
你不能去拯救了
I don't think he's the kind you save.

1238
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:30,920
你需要阻止他
He's the kind you stop.

1239
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,020
我不知道我下不下得去手
I don't know if I could do that.

1240
01:33:35,410 --> 01:33:37,260
他也许会逼得你没得选
Well, he might not give you a choice.

1241
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:38,640
他不记得你了
He doesn't know you.

1242
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:40,650
他会记起来的
He will.

1243
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:45,350
时间到了  准备出发
Gear up, it's time.

1244
01:33:47,890 --> 01:33:48,900
你就穿这身去吗
You gonna wear that?

1245
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,490
不  要去打仗
No. If you're gonna fight a war,

1246
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:52,030
就得穿上军装
you gotta wear a uniform.

1247
01:34:00,170 --> 01:34:05,030
完了  饭碗丢定了
Oh, man. I am so fired!

1248
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:31,430
进入发射的最后阶段
We are in final launch sequence.

1249
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:33,590
{\an8}洞察发射

1250
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,720
制导系统就绪
We are go on guidance.

1251
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:39,360
所有人员请前往发射台
All personnel, to launch station.

1252
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:41,360
飞行旅途如何
And how was your flight?

1253
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:44,680
很不错  不过从机场来这的路上不怎么样
Lovely. The ride from the airport less so.

1254
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:47,220
很遗憾神盾局没法控制一切
Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D can't control everything.

1255
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:49,390
包括美国队长
Including Captain America.

1256
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:55,790
大楼的身份认证靠生物识别
This facility is biometrically controlled,

1257
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:58,670
这胸章能让你们在这里畅行无阻
and these will give you unrestricted access.

1258
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:04,000
我把车停在那儿两个月了
I've been parking there for two months.

1259
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:04,950
可那是他的车位
But it's his spot.

1260
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:05,810
那他去哪了
So where's he been?

1261
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:07,130
大概去阿富汗了吧
I think Afghanistan.

1262
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:09,390
不可以  DT6  着陆航线已满
Negative, DT-6. The pattern is full.

1263
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:10,810
他该事先说明的
Well, he could have said something.

1264
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:13,790
天线出问题了吧
Must be the dish.

1265
01:35:15,490 --> 01:35:16,740
我去看看
I'll check it out.

1266
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:25,740
麻烦让一下
Excuse us.

1267
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:28,460
我知道过程很坎坷
I know the road hasn't exactly been smooth,

1268
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:30,020
你们中可能有人
and some of you would have

1269
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:32,400
早就看我不顺眼了
gladly kicked me out of the car along the way.

1270
01:35:34,330 --> 01:35:37,610
我们终于齐聚在这  全世界都将心存感激
Finally we're here, and the world should be grateful.

1271
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,500
所有神盾局特工注意
Attention, all S.H.I.E.L.D agents.

1272
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,040
我是史蒂夫·罗杰斯
This is Steve Rogers.

1273
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:46,450
这几天你们听到了不少我的消息
You've heard a lot about me over the last few days,

1274
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,630
有些人甚至奉命追捕我
some of you were even ordered to hunt me down.

1275
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,510
但我认为应该告诉你们真相
But I think it's time you know the truth.

1276
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:58,600
神盾局并不是我们想象的样子
S.H.I.E.L.D is not what we thought it was,

1277
01:35:58,870 --> 01:36:00,930
它已经被九头蛇渗透了
it's been taken over by Hydra.

1278
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:03,790
他们的首领是亚历山大·皮尔斯
Alexander Pierce is their leader.

1279
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:09,790
突击队和洞察计划的人也是九头蛇
The S.T.R.I.K.E and Insight crew are Hydra as well.

1280
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:13,830
我不知道还有多少  但他们就在这里
I don't know how many more, but I know they're in the building.

1281
01:36:15,190 --> 01:36:16,910
可能就站在你身边
They could be standing right next to you.

1282
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:22,870
他们差点如愿以偿  得到绝对控制权
They almost have what they want: absolute control.

1283
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:27,540
尼克·弗瑞的被害只是个开始
They shot the Nick Fury and it won't end there.

1284
01:36:27,710 --> 01:36:29,730
如果你们今天发射了天空航母
If you launch those helicarriers today,

1285
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:31,280
九头蛇将能够杀死
Hydra will be able to kill anyone

1286
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:32,780
所有妨碍他们计划的人
that stands in their way,

1287
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:36,750
除非我们阻止他们
unless we stop them.

1288
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:42,440
我知道这很难做到
I know I'm asking a lot,

1289
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:47,070
但自由的代价一向是高昂的
but the price of freedom is high, it always has been,

1290
01:36:47,790 --> 01:36:49,700
我愿意付出这代价
and it's a price I'm willing to pay.

1291
01:36:51,870 --> 01:36:54,370
哪怕只有我一个人  我也会坚持到底
And if I'm the only one, then so be it.

1292
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:58,050
但我相信我不是一个人
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.

1293
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,690
你是背的稿子
Did you write that down first,

1294
01:37:04,990 --> 01:37:06,570
还是临场发挥的
or was it off the top of your head?

1295
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:09,190
你这婊子养的
You smug son of a bitch.

1296
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:14,090
把他抓起来
Arrest him.

1297
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:17,960
看来还是我说了算
I guess I've got the floor.

1298
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:26,500
提前发射进程
Preempt the launch sequence,

1299
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,000
马上把航母送上天
send those ships up now.

1300
01:37:32,350 --> 01:37:33,570
你有意见吗
Is there a problem?

1301
01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:34,680
我
I'm...

1302
01:37:38,910 --> 01:37:39,970
你有意见吗
Is there a problem?

1303
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:41,060
抱歉  长官
I'm sorry, sir.

1304
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:51,570
我不会发射航母的
I'm not gonna launch those ships.

1305
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:56,100
队长有令
Captain's orders.

1306
01:37:56,350 --> 01:37:57,790
离开你的操作台
Move away from your station.

1307
01:37:58,180 --> 01:37:59,270
他说了
Like he said.

1308
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:03,490
队长有令
Captain's orders.

1309
01:38:05,210 --> 01:38:07,100
你站错边了  特工
You picked the wrong side, agent.

1310
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:09,980
那要看你的处境吧
Depends on where you're standing.

1311
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,060
{\an8}程序重写

1312
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:55,970
关闭舰湾闸门
Close the bay door!

1313
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:59,300
快关上闸门  快关上
Close the bay door now! Close the bay door!

1314
01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:20,510
他们启动发射了
They're initiating launch.

1315
01:39:40,130 --> 01:39:41,000
队长
Hey, Cap,

1316
01:39:41,010 --> 01:39:42,880
怎么区分坏人和好人
how do we know the good guys from the bad guys?

1317
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,800
朝你开枪的就是坏人
If they're shooting at you, they're bad.

1318
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:18,820
队长
Hey, Cap,

1319
01:40:19,030 --> 01:40:21,200
我碰到你说的坏人了
I found those bad guys you were talking about.

1320
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:22,110
你还好吗
You okay?

1321
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:25,590
还没死
Not dead yet.

1322
01:40:32,930 --> 01:40:34,420
容我问一个问题
Let me ask you a question.

1323
01:40:36,770 --> 01:40:39,760
如果巴基斯坦明天攻进了孟买
What if Pakistan marched into Mumbai tomorrow,

1324
01:40:41,230 --> 01:40:43,700
而你已经知道他们会把你女儿
and you knew that they were gonna drag your daughters

1325
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:46,900
拖到足球场里处决
into a soccer stadium for execution?

1326
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:50,250
你只需要按一下按钮
And you could just stop

1327
01:40:50,730 --> 01:40:54,870
就能阻止这一切  你会按吗  你们呢
it with a flick of a switch. Would you? Wouldn't you all?

1328
01:40:57,210 --> 01:40:59,270
我不要你的按钮
Not if it was your switch.

1329
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:24,490
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1330
01:41:30,990 --> 01:41:32,670
抢你风头了吗
Did I step on your moment?

1331
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:36,460
卫星到达三千英尺高度
Satellites in range at three thousand feet.

1332
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:38,630
猎鹰  情况如何
Falcon, status?

1333
01:41:38,630 --> 01:41:39,790
交战中
Engaging.

1334
01:42:03,930 --> 01:42:05,370
队长  我进来了
Alright, Cap, I'm in.

1335
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:08,930
我靠
Shit!

1336
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:40,520
还有八分钟  队长
Eight minutes, Cap.

1337
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:42,030
我在努力了
Working on it.

1338
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:51,550
你在做什么
What are you doing?

1339
01:42:51,550 --> 01:42:53,690
她在解除安全协议
She's disabling security protocols

1340
01:42:53,690 --> 01:42:55,470
把所有秘密公布到网上
and dumping all the secrets onto the Internet.

1341
01:42:55,470 --> 01:42:56,720
包括九头蛇的
Including Hydra's.

1342
01:42:56,730 --> 01:42:57,890
也有神盾局的
And S.H.I.E.L.D's.

1343
01:42:58,730 --> 01:42:59,410
一旦你这么做
If you do this,

1344
01:42:59,410 --> 01:43:01,550
你的过去就都大白于天下了
none of your past is gonna remain hidden.

1345
01:43:04,620 --> 01:43:06,030
你确定想让
Are you sure you're ready

1346
01:43:06,030 --> 01:43:08,340
全世界都看到你的真面目吗
for the world to see you as you really are?

1347
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:10,760
那你呢
Are you?

1348
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:28,380
A船替换完成
Alpha locked.

1349
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:32,090
猎鹰  你在哪里
Falcon, where are you now?

1350
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:33,540
我得先兜个圈子
I had to take a detour!

1351
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:14,490
我进来了
I'm in.

1352
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,060
B船替换完成
Bravo locked.

1353
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,130
解决两个  还剩一个
Two down, one to go.

1354
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:26,930
全体神盾局飞行员  紧急起飞
All S.H.I.E.L.D pilots, scramble.

1355
01:44:27,390 --> 01:44:30,130
我们是罗杰斯队长仅有的空中支援
We're the only air support Captain Rogers has got.

1356
01:45:11,150 --> 01:45:12,570
{\an8}访问受限

1357
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:15,240
解锁是行政命令
Disabling the encryption is an executive order,

1358
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:17,030
需要两名A级人员
it takes two Alpha Level members.

1359
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,400
别担心  人马上就到
Don't worry, company's coming.

1360
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:43,990
你收到我的花了吗
Did you get my flowers?

1361
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:48,040
我很高兴你能来  尼克
I'm glad you're here, Nick.

1362
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:48,940
是吗
Really?

1363
01:45:50,330 --> 01:45:52,410
因为我以为是你杀了我
Cause I thought you had me killed.

1364
01:45:52,410 --> 01:45:53,850
你知道游戏规则的
You know how the game works.

1365
01:45:54,830 --> 01:45:56,640
为什么让我做神盾局局长
So why make me head of S.H.I.E.L.D?

1366
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:58,000
因为你是我认识的
Cause you're the best

1367
01:45:58,040 --> 01:45:59,740
最好的  最无情的人
and the most ruthless person I ever met.

1368
01:45:59,740 --> 01:46:02,250
我是在尽力保护人民
I did what I did to protect people.

1369
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:05,390
我们的敌人就是你的敌人  尼克
Our enemies are your enemies, Nick.

1370
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:08,250
混乱  战争
Disorder, war.

1371
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:09,860
脏弹袭击莫斯科
It's just a matter of time

1372
01:46:09,860 --> 01:46:13,830
或者电磁脉冲瘫痪芝加哥只是迟早的事
before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow, or an EMP fries Chicago.

1373
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:19,470
靠外交吗  治标不治本
Diplomacy? Holding action, a band-aid.

1374
01:46:20,470 --> 01:46:23,980
你知道我是在哪里想清楚的  波哥大[哥伦比亚]
And you know where I learned that: Bogota.

1375
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:27,920
你没征求同意  而是做了该做的事
You didn't ask, you just did what had to be done.

1376
01:46:28,990 --> 01:46:33,210
我可以让七十亿人获得秩序
I can bring order to the lives of seven billion people

1377
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:36,330
只要牺牲两千万人
by sacrificing twenty million.

1378
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,610
如果你有胆量迈出去
It's the next step, Nick,

1379
01:46:39,190 --> 01:46:40,560
这就是下一步  尼克
if you have the courage to take it.

1380
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,700
不  我有胆量不迈出去
No, I have the courage not to.

1381
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:49,610
虹膜扫描开启
Retinal scanner active.

1382
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:53,030
你以为我们不会取消你的权限吗
You don't you think we wiped your clearance from the system?

1383
01:46:53,030 --> 01:46:57,560
我知道你删了我的密码  应该还有扫描记录
I know you erased my password, probably deleted my retinal scan,

1384
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:01,180
但如果你想先我一步  部长先生
but if you want to stay ahead of me, Mr. Secretary...

1385
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:07,900
就得瞪大两只眼睛
You need to keep both eyes open.

1386
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:14,200
A级人员确认
Alpha Level confirmed.

1387
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:17,430
加密解锁  保密协议取消
Encryption code accepted. Safeguards removed.

1388
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:20,780
航母C在左前方45度
Charlie Carrier's forty-five degrees off the port bow.

1389
01:47:26,660 --> 01:47:27,730
六分钟
Six minutes.

1390
01:47:27,730 --> 01:47:29,870
山姆  我需要搭个便车
Hey, Sam, I'm gonna need a ride.

1391
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:33,100
收到  准备好了通知我
Roger! Let me know when you're ready.

1392
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:36,390
准备好了
I just did!

1393
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:56,130
你比看起来重多了
You know, you're a lot heavier than you look.

1394
01:47:56,630 --> 01:47:57,950
我早饭吃多了
I had a big breakfast.

1395
01:48:00,020 --> 01:48:00,860
史蒂夫
Steve!

1396
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:33,740
队长  队长  回话  你还好吗
Cap? Cap, come in. Are you okay?

1397
01:48:33,770 --> 01:48:37,210
收到  我还在天空航母上
Yeah, I'm here! I'm still on the Helicarrier.

1398
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:38,320
你在哪里
Where are you?

1399
01:48:38,330 --> 01:48:42,670
我不能飞了  战衣坏了  抱歉  队长
I'm grounded, the suit's down. Sorry, Cap.

1400
01:48:42,870 --> 01:48:44,210
别担心  我能行
Don't worry, I got it.

1401
01:49:00,810 --> 01:49:02,470
长官  理事会被控制了
Sir, Council's been breached.

1402
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:04,290
说详细情况
Repeat dispatch.

1403
01:49:04,290 --> 01:49:05,640
黑寡妇在上面
Black Widow's up there.

1404
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:06,620
我现在上去
Headed up!

1405
01:49:09,430 --> 01:49:10,290
猎鹰
Falcon?

1406
01:49:10,290 --> 01:49:10,890
什么事
Yeah?

1407
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:12,480
朗姆洛往理事会方向去了
Rumlow's headed for the Council.

1408
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:13,460
我来
I'm on it.

1409
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:25,910
会有很多人丧命的  巴基
People are gonna die, Buck.

1410
01:49:27,620 --> 01:49:29,070
我不能坐视不理
I can't let that happen.

1411
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:39,100
求你别逼我这么做
Please, don't make me do this.

1412
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:49,040
{\an8}传输完成

1413
01:50:48,810 --> 01:50:49,670
好了

九头蛇不留囚犯
There are no prisoners with Hydra,

1424

你还怀疑罗杰斯会失败吗

该走了  女理事

他们又没把楼层号
It's not like they put the floor numbers

1478
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:09,180
标在大楼的外墙上

1494

我不知道他还有什么可说的
I don't know what's left for him to say.

1495
02:02:56,140 --> 02:02:57,960
我认为波托马克河
I think the rock in the middle of the

1496
02:02:57,960 --> 02:02:59,680
里的残骸已经表明了一切
Potomac made his point fairly eloquently.

1497
02:02:59,680 --> 02:03:01,890
他可以解释一下  这个国家该怎么

1498
02:03:01,890 --> 02:03:04,470
维护自己的安全
to maintain its national security now that

1499
02:03:04,470 --> 02:03:08,420
因为你们俩毁掉了我们的情报机构
he and you have laid waste our intelligence apparatus.

1500
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:10,490
九头蛇卖给你们的是谎言  不是情报

1501

很多谎言还是出自你口

1504
02:03:17,420 --> 02:03:18,930
考虑到你既服务过这个国家
given your service record,

1505
02:03:18,930 --> 02:03:21,190
也背叛过这个国家
both for this country and against it,

1506
02:03:21,690 --> 02:03:26,210
你应该被监禁  而不是在国会山和我们顶嘴
that you belong in a penitentiary, not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.

1507
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:29,440
你们不会把我关进监狱的
You're not gonna put me in a prison.

1508
02:03:29,850 --> 02:03:34,510
你们不会把任何人关进去的  知道为什么吗
You're not gonna put any of us in a prison. You know why?

1509
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:37,070
请指点吧
Do enlighten us.

1510
02:03:37,130 --> 02:03:38,660
因为你们需要我们
Because you need us.

1511
02:03:39,490 --> 02:03:41,990
是的  这个世界很脆弱
Yes, the world is a vulnerable place,

1512
02:03:42,050 --> 02:03:44,040
是的  我们对此负有责任
and yes, we helped make it that way.

1513
02:03:44,820 --> 02:03:47,770
但我们也是最能保护它的人
But we're also the ones best qualified to defend it.

1514
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:51,350
所以你们要想逮捕我  就动手吧
So if you want to arrest me, arrest me.

1515
02:03:52,270 --> 02:03:53,670
你们知道去哪里找我
You'll know where to find me.

1516
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:32,600
你经历过这种事情
So, you've experienced this sort of things before?

1517

你会习惯的
You get used to it.

我们挖掘了九头蛇的资料
We've been data-mining Hydra's files.

1521
02:04:39,300 --> 02:04:41,820
看来有很多漏网之鱼
Looks Like a lot of rats didn't go down with the ship.

1522
02:04:43,060 --> 02:04:46,910
我今晚启程去欧洲  你要一起吗
I'm heading to Europe tonight, wanted to ask if you'd come.

1523
02:04:47,870 --> 02:04:49,680
我还有事要做

1524
02:04:50,300 --> 02:04:53,350
你呢  威尔逊  我需要有你这样本事的人
How about you, Wilson? I could use a man with your abilities.

1525
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:55,910
比起间谍  我更喜欢当士兵
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

1526
02:04:56,770 --> 02:04:57,790
好吧
Alright then.

1527
02:05:03,100 --> 02:05:07,430
要是有人问起我  让他们来这里找我
Anybody asks for me, tell them they can find me right here.

1528
02:05:09,100 --> 02:05:09,650
你该感到荣幸
You should be honored,

1529
02:05:09,650 --> 02:05:12,290
这在他这儿  是最接近"谢谢"的了
that's about as close as he gets to saying thank you.

1530
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,760
你不跟他一起吗
Not going with him?

1531
02:05:15,410 --> 02:05:16,310
不
No.

1532
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:17,400
也不留下
Not staying here?

1533
02:05:19,580 --> 02:05:22,090
我的身份全都暴露了  我得去弄个新的
I blew all my covers, I gotta go figure out a new one.

1534
02:05:22,090 --> 02:05:23,140
那得花上一段时间
That might take a while.

1535
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:24,870
正好歇一阵子
I'm counting on it.

1536
02:05:27,220 --> 02:05:28,790
你要的那个东西
That thing you asked for,

1537
02:05:28,790 --> 02:05:31,200
我找基辅的几个朋友帮了些忙
I called in a few favors from Kiev.

1538
02:05:33,740 --> 02:05:37,140
算是帮我个忙  约那个护士吧
Will you do me a favor? Call that nurse.

1539
02:05:37,270 --> 02:05:38,400
她不是护士
She's not a nurse.

1540
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:40,310
你也不是神盾局特工
And you're not a S.H.I.E.L.D agent.

1541
02:05:41,290 --> 02:05:42,330
她叫什么来着
What was her name again?

Be careful, Steve.

1544
02:06:00,260 --> 02:06:02,210
里面的东西你要做好心理准备
You might not want to pull on that thread.

1545
02:06:13,580 --> 02:06:14,600
你要去找他吗
You're going after him?

1546
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:16,990
你不必跟我一起来
You don't have to come with me.

1547
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:17,960
我知道
I know.

1548
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:21,220

弗瑞将一切都公之于众了
Fury has released everything to the public.

1553
02:08:25,210 --> 02:08:26,890
只公布了他知道的信息
Everything he knows about.

1554
02:08:26,970 --> 02:08:28,920
斯特拉克先生  如果他们知道我们在这里做的事
Mr. Strucker, if they get word of our work here,

1555
02:08:28,930 --> 02:08:30,890
如果他们知道我们服务于九头蛇
if they find out we serve Hydra...

1556
02:08:30,890 --> 02:08:33,160
九头蛇  神盾局
Hydra, S.H.I.E.L.D,

1557
02:08:33,700 --> 02:08:37,100
两个都一样  现在都不行了
two sides of a coin that's no longer currency.

1558
02:08:40,350 --> 02:08:41,790
我们拥有的东西
What we have

1559
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:46,410
价值是他们无法想象的

1560
02:08:49,160 --> 02:08:52,710
我们只接触到了点皮毛  就已经...
We've only scratched the surface and already...

1561
02:08:55,700 --> 02:09:00,020
世界上还有其他为九头蛇工作的机构
There are other facilities doing Hydra's good work around the world.

1562
02:09:00,680 --> 02:09:04,240
全丢给美国队长和他那帮乱七八糟的朋友
We'll feed them to Captain America and his colorful friends.

1563
02:09:04,340 --> 02:09:06,150
引开他们的注意
Keep them off our scent.

我对你做的那些事了解得越多
The more I read about what you did and stuff...

126

159
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,040
严格来讲  我没有打劫他们  打劫包括恐吓
Well, technically, I didn't rob them. Robbery involves threat.

我讨厌暴力  我偷了他们  我是个飞贼
I hate violence. I burgled them. I'm a cat burglar.

他黑进了安保系统
He hacks into the security system

167
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,710
把上百万美金

我表兄两周前跟一个人

00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,720
聊到一票超完美的活
about this little perfect job.

177
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,650
不干
No way.

178
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,120
别别别  等一下  这个人

正好是你不喜欢的那种
This guy fits your M.O.

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,430
我金盆洗手了  我不要再进监狱了
I'm finished, man. I'm not going back to jail.

皮姆博士
Dr. Pym?

00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,250
是的  我还活着
Yes. I'm still alive.

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,580
身份证明
ID?

188
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,550

Perhaps that will suffice.

196
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,060
简直是激动万分
More like "thrilled".

197
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,040
收到你发的邀请函
I was surprised to receive

198
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,660
我还真是意外呀  达伦
any kind of invitation from you, Darren.

看来有些旧伤是无法痊愈的

你先请
After you.

在我们开始前
Now, before we start,

210
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,200
我想先介绍一位非常特别的嘉宾
I'd like to introduce a very special guest.

211
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,190
这个公司的创始人以及我的导师
This company's founder and my mentor,

212
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,650
汉克·皮姆博士
Dr. Hank Pym.

213
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,750
当我从皮姆博士手中接管了这家公司时
When I took over this company for Dr. Pym,

214
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,030
我便立刻开始研究一个
I immediately started researching a particle

215
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,960
可以改变分子间距离
that could change the distance between atoms,

216
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,180
并增加密度和力量的粒子
while increasing density and strength.

217
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,220
如此一个革命性的想法为何会
Why this revolutionary idea remained buried

218
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,140
一直被埋在汉克的众多研究中
beneath the dust and cobwebs of

219
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,060
积累尘土和蜘蛛网  我不得而知
Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

220
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,060
但请想像一下
But just imagine,

221
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,780
一个昆虫大小的士兵
a soldier the size of an insect.

222
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,490
终极秘密武器

223
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,110
蚁人
An Ant-Man.

224
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,870
他们当初就是这么称呼你的  对吧  汉克
That's what they called you. Right, Hank?

225
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,910
有点傻  我知道
Silly, I know.

226
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,430
这只是宣传手段
Propaganda.

227
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,040
用来唬人的故事
Tales to astonish!

228
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,350
捏造出来吓唬苏联的故事
Trumped-up BS to scare the USSR.

229
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,370
汉克  可以请你告诉来宾们
Hank, will you tell our guests what you told me

230
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,870
我每一次问你"蚁人真实存在吗"
every single time I asked you,

231
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,160
你是怎么回答我的
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

232
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,760
这只是个传说
Just a tall tale.

233
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,600
没错
Right.

234
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,540
因为如此不可思议的事
Because how could anything so miraculous

235
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,090
怎么可能是真的
possibly be real?

236
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:20,080
我受到蚁人传说的启发
Well, I was inspired by the legend of the Ant-Man.

237
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,890
有了我缩小无机物材料的突破性进展
And with my breakthrough shrinking inorganic material,

238
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,580
我就想  有没有可能把人也缩小呢
I thought, could it be possible to shrink a person?

239
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,240
这有可能做到吗

00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,410

所以这就是件衣服

272
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,880
别说这么粗俗  弗兰克
Don't be crude, Frank.

273
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,810
这不是件衣服  而是个机甲
It's not a suit, it's a vessel.

274
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,130
怎么了  这项发明没有打动你吗
What's the matter? You're not impressed?

275
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,260
不  让人印象深刻  但我也有顾虑
No, I'm impressed. I'm also concerned.

276
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,850
想像一下我们的敌人能用这项技术做什么

277
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,590
我们应该好好聊一下这个问题  弗兰克
We should have a longer conversation about that, Frank.

278

我很重视你的意见

达伦  我尘封那些秘密是有原因的
Darren, there's a reason that I buried these secrets.

284
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,780
你终于承认了
So you finally admit it!

285
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,820
我们本可携手完成  汉克
We could have done this together, Hank.

286
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,270
但你却把机会毁了
But you ruined that.

287
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,750
所以你只停留在过去  我才是未来
That's why you're the past and I'm the future.

288
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,500
别这么做
Don't do this.

289
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,720
克洛斯博士
Dr. Cross?

你先卖给我  我出比你要价高20%的价格

两周后我就可以付你现金

成交
Deal.

293
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,630
我们该行动了  汉克
We have to make our move, Hank.

294
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,280
他进展得怎么样了
How close is he?

295
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,430
他还没法缩小生物
He still can't shrink a live subject.

296
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,290
你就把衣服给我
Just give me the suit

297
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,170
我来永除后患
and let me finish this once and for all.

298
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,120
不行
No.

299
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,180
克洛斯完全信任我
I have Cross' complete trust.

300
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,060
太危险了
It's too dangerous.

301
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,860
我们别无选择
We don't have a choice.

302
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,060
也不尽然
Well, that's not entirely true.

303
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,640
我想我找到了合适的人选
I think I found a guy.

304
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,490
谁
Who?

305
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,360
爸爸
Daddy!

306
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,160
小花生
Peanut! Oh!

307
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,640
生日快乐
Happy birthday!

308
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,500
非常抱歉  我迟到了
I'm so sorry I'm late.

309
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,240
我不知道聚会几点开始
I didn't know what time your party started.

310
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,960
邀请上写了时间的
It was on the invitation.

311
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,720
他都没收到邀请
He didn't get an invitation.

312
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,250
可他还是来了
But he came anyway!

313
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,380
我不会错过宝贝女儿的生日聚会
Well, I'm not gonna miss my little girl's birthday party.

314
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,050
我去告诉妈妈你来了
I'm gonna go tell Mommy you're here.

315
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:47,990
别
Oh, you don't...

316
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,310
你来这儿干什么  郎
What are you doing here, Lang?

317
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,770
你没给过孩子一分钱的抚养费
You haven't paid a dime of child support.

318
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,600
现在  只要我乐意  就可以逮捕你
You know, right now, if I wanted to, I could arrest you.

319
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,850
好像我很愿意见你似的  帕克斯顿
It's good to see you too, Paxton.

320
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,310
你能来妈妈可高兴了  她喝水都呛着了
Mommy's so happy you're here, she choked on her drink.

321
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,840
看我给你带了什么
Hey, look what I have for you.

322
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,800
我能现在就打开吗
Can I open it now?

323
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,530
当然能  宝贝儿  今天是你的生日啊
Of course, sweetheart. It's your birthday.

324
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,950
你是我最最最好的朋友
You're my bestest friend.

325
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:11,970
那是什么玩意儿
What is that thing?

326
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,960
他好丑啊
He's so ugly!

327
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,860
我爱死他了
I love him!

328
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,970
我能拿给我朋友们看吗
Can I go show my friends?

329
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,920
当然能  宝贝儿  去吧
Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead.

330
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,330
你是我最最最好的朋友
You're my bestest friend.

331
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,370
我会给孩子抚养费的
Look, the child support is coming, all right?

332
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,110
不过有了前科就很难找到工作
It's just hard finding a job when you have a record.

333
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,180
我相信你能想法解决
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

334
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:27,700
不过现在
But for now,

335
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,060
-我希望你离开我家  -不可能
- I want you out of my house. - No way!

336
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,000
这是我女儿的生日聚会
It's my daughter's birthday party.

337
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,280
-这是我家  -那又如何
- It's my house! - So what?

338
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,540
-她是我闺女  -斯科特
- It's my kid! - Scott!

339
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,930
你不能说来就来  你知道的  走吧
You can't just show up here. You know that. Come on.

340
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,950
这是生日聚会啊
It's a birthday party.

341
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,910
我知道  但你不能说来就来
Yeah, I know, but you can't just show up.

342
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,710
她是我闺女
She's my daughter.

343
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,330
你根本就不懂怎么做父亲
You don't know the first thing about being a father.

344
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,900
玛姬  看在你是我初恋
Maggie, I tell you this as a friend,

345
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,620
我们还是朋友的份上  我告诉你
and as the first love of my life.

346
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,410
你的未婚夫是个混袋
Your fiance is an asshat.

347
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,260
他不是混袋
He's not an asshat.

348
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,480
喂  嘴巴放干净点儿
Hey, watch your language. Okay?

349
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,530
哪里不干净了  我说的是袋
What language? I said "Hat."

350
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,540
别吵了
Stop it.

351
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,400
真的吗  玛姬  就他
Really, Maggie? That guy?

352
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,970
你可以嫁给任何你喜欢的人
Come on! You could marry anyone you want,

353
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,650
为什么偏要选个条子呢
and you have to get engaged to a cop?

354
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,210
至少他不是骗子
At least he's not a crook.

355
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,860
我在努力  我已经改过自新  洗手不干了
I'm trying, okay? I've changed. I'm straight.

356
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,250
我找了份工作
I had a job and...

357
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,650
我想付抚养费
I wanna provide.

358
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,560
我花了很多时间思考  现在我明白了
I had a lot of time to think about it and I love her.

359
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,300
我非常爱她
So much.

360
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,600
我错过了太多
I've missed so much time

361
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,230
我想成为她生活的一部分
and I wanna be a part of her life.

362
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,460
我该怎么做
What do I do?

363
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,990
租套公寓
Get an apartment,

364
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,130
找份工作  付抚养费
get a job, pay child support.

365
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,100
然后我们再讨论探视孩子的问题
And then we will talk about visitation, I promise.

366
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,360
你是她的英雄  斯科特
You're her hero, Scott.

367
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,040
成为她心目中的那个人吧
Just be the person that she already thinks you are.

368
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,410
弗兰克  很遗憾
I'm sorry you have such

369
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,740
你对黄衫深表担忧
deep concerns about the Yellowjacket, Frank.

370
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,890
是啊
Yeah. Well, uh...

371
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:09,410
很不幸  我们不能为所欲为
Unfortunately, we can't just do whatever we want.

372
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,110
那样就好了
It'd be nice though, right?

373
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,010
但是得遵守法则
But there are laws.

374
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,570
什么法则  人的吗
What laws? Of man?

375
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,240
自然法则高于人的法则
The laws of nature transcend the laws of man.

376
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,350
而我要高于自然法则
And I have transcended the laws of nature.

377
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,640
达伦  我觉得你不懂
Darren, I don't think you understand...

378
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,980
我们还没解决所有问题
We still haven't worked out all the bugs.

379
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,680
永别了  弗兰克
Goodbye, Frank.

380
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,550
谢谢
Thank you.

381
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,670
我最近一直在想感恩这事
You know, I've been thinking a lot about gratitude lately.

382
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,260
今天早上  我在冥想的时候
And today, during my morning meditation,

383
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,800
得出了一个有意思的结论
an interesting thought occurred to me,

384
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,530
我觉得也适用于你
and I think it might apply to you, too.

385
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,400
什么结论
How's that?

386
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,310
感恩可以是原谅
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

387
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,480
我有好几年都活在对汉克·皮姆的愤恨中
I've spent years carrying around my anger for Hank Pym.

388
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,120
我把我的才华都奉献给了他
I devoted my genius to him.

389
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,880
我本来可以去任何地方工作
I could have worked anywhere.

390
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,510
我没选好导师

00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,630
你更愿意待在牢房里了
that you prefer the inside of a jail cell.

545
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,710
天哪
Oh, man.

546
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,830
坐下
Sit down.

547
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,530
先生  对不起  我偷了衣服
Sir, I'm sorry I stole the suit.

548
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,510
我根本不想知道你为什么有这个
I don't even wanna know why you have it.

549
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,310
玛姬没看错你
Maggie was right about you.

550
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,690
你怎么知道
How do you know about...

551
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,040
怪不得她不让你接近凯西
No wonder she's trying to keep you away from Cassie.

552
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,350
世事开始变艰难的时候
The moment things get hard,

553
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,000
你就会回去犯罪
you turn right back to crime.

554
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,150
在我看来  你有一个选择
The way I see it, you have a choice.

555
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,290
要么在监狱里度过余生
You can either spend the rest of your life in prison,

556
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,580
要么回到你的牢房
or go back to your cell

557
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,540
等待进一步的指示
and await further instructions.

558
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,560
我不明白
I don't understand.

559
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,330
我也不指望你能明白
No, I don't expect you to.

560
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,500
但你现在没什么选择的余地
But you don't have many options right now,

561
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,960
坦白讲  我也没有
and quite frankly, neither do I.

562
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:50,030
你觉得当初
Why do you think

563
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,040
我为什么要让你偷那套衣服呢
I let you steal that suit in the first place?

564
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,110
什么
What?

565
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:07,700
第二次机会可是很难得啊
Second chances don't come around all that much.

566
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,840
所以下次你要是觉得看到了机会
So, next time you think you might see one,

567
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,240
我建议你仔细看看
I suggest you take a real close look at it.

568
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,430
你是我最最最好的朋友
You're my bestest friend!

569
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,830
你真的不想要别的玩具吗
Are you sure you don't want a different toy?

570
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,600
不  我喜欢这个
No, I love this one.

571
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:37,430
好吧  睡觉吧  我爱你
Okay. Well, get some sleep. I love you.

572
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,620
妈妈
Mommy?

573
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,070
爸爸是坏人吗
Is Daddy a bad man?

574
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,350
我听有些大人说他是坏人
I heard some grownups say he's bad.

575
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,760
不是
No.

576
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,860
爸爸有时只是有些迷茫
Daddy just gets confused sometimes, you know?

577
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,610
明智之选  你总算听进去了一回
Smart choice. You actually listened, for once.

578
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,570
从门下走
Under the door.

579
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,110
好吧  现在去哪里
Okay, where to now?

580
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,540
-稳住 -天呐
- Hang tight. - Oh, God.

581
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,040
什么  什么
What, what?

582
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,080
他跑哪儿去了
Where the hell did he go?

583
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,470
我不知道  他就那么消失了
I have no idea. He just vanished.

584
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,410
封锁周边五个街区  马上
Set up a five-block perimeter. Now!

585
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,820
退后  退后  退后
Get back! Get back! Get back!

586
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,700
-斯科特  这些是我的同伴  -什么
- Scott, these are my associates.  - What?

587
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,710
那只蚂蚁身上是背了个相机吗
Is that a camera on an ant?

588
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,090
是啊  当然了  为什么不呢
Yeah, sure. Why not?

589
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,400
车在哪
Where's the car?

590
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,060
没有车  我们用飞的
No car. We've got wings.

591
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,080
到达
Incoming!

592
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,120
把脚放在中心节点上  然后扶住胸腔
Put your foot on the central node and mount the thorax.

593
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,660
你在逗我吗
Are you Kidding?

594
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,160
-这东西安不安...  -你他妈快上去  斯科特
- How safe is... - Just get on the damn ant, Scott!

595
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,050
我为什么在一辆警车上
Why am I on a police car?

596
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,940
我难道不是不应该在警车上吗
Shouldn't I not be on a police car?

597
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,990
这样你就可以搭个顺风车
So they can give you a lift

598
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,850
通过他们五个街区的封锁
past their five-block perimeter.

599
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,350
好吧  下一步怎么办
All right. Now, what's the next move?

600
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,540
抓紧了
Hang on tight.

601
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,350
这个容易  我找到窍门了
Oh, this is easy! I'm getting the hang of this.

602
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,000
往上拉就能向上飞  就像骑马一样
Yank up to go up. It's like a horse.

603
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,950
你要让247失去平衡了
You're throwing 247 off balance.

604
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,420
等等  他的名字叫247吗
Wait, his name is 247?

605
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,370
他没有名字  只有编号  斯科特
He doesn't have a name, he has a number, Scott.

606
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:06,100
你知道一共有多少只蚂蚁吗
Do you have any idea how many ants there are?

607
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,570
也许它是...也许它是248
Maybe it's... maybe it's 248.

608
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,210
不不不不  要晕了  要晕了
No, no, no, no! Vertigo, vertigo!

609
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,250
不  我觉得它是247
No, I think it's 247.

610
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:13,750
等等
Wait.

611
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,210
抓紧了
Hang on tight!

612
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,120
我觉得我逐渐掌握窍门了
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

613
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,260
是我在控制247  他并非听命于你
I am controlling 247. He is not listening to you.

614
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,240
什么
What?

615
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,320
-我能提个小小的要求吗  -不能
- Can I make one little request? - No.

616
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,630
停下来  247  打住  打住
Stop, 247! Time out, time out.

617
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,570
不玩了
Time out.

618
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,450
{\an8}斯科维亚事件该怪谁

619
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,110
好了  等一下
All right, hold on.

620
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,680
等等
Just wait!

621
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,340
假如我吐在了头盔里会发生什么
What happens if I throw up in this helmet?

622
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,470
这是我的头盔  斯科特  别吐里面
It's my helmet, Scott. You do not throw up.

623
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,020
让她停下来吧  好不好
Let's set her down, all right?

624
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,180
我头有点晕了
I'm getting light-headed.

625
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,430
坚持住  斯科特
Hang on, Scott.

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,710
我有点...
I'm getting a little...

627
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,350

I need a snooze button.

628
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,450
5分钟后叫醒我
Hit me in 5 minutes.

629
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,470
你好

你就一直在那站着
Have you been standing there,

632
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,560
看我睡觉吗
watching me sleep, this whole time?

633
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,620
没错
Yes.

634
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:20,800
为什么

因为你上次来时  是来偷东西的
Because the last time you were here, you stole something.

我可以破坏掉服务器
I could take down the servers

我们不需要这个人
We don't need this guy.

我猜你已经见过我女儿霍普了
I assume that you've already met my daughter, Hope.

00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,580
你是说  她是谁  这他妈发生什么事了
Who are you, who is she, what the hell's going on,

697
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,230
我现在能回监狱吗
and can I go back to jail now?

698
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,680
和我来
Come with me.

699
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,410
40年前  我创造了一个公式
40 years ago, I created a formula

700
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,780
能改变原子间的相对距离
that altered atomic relative distance.

701
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,570
什么
Huh?

702
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,480
我得知了如何改变原子间的距离
I learned how to change the distance between atoms.

703
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,110
那就是那件衣服的动力
That's what powers the suit.

704
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,650
它运作的原理
That's why it works.

705
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,360
但这是很危险的
But it was dangerous.

706
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,440
过于危险了
It was too dangerous.

707
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,710
所以我将它藏起来了
So I hid it from the world.

708
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,390
从那时我便另起炉灶  开了自己的公司
And that's when I switched gears and I started my own company.

709
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:01,790
皮姆科技
Pym Tech.

710
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:02,670
没错
Yes.

711
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,490
我收了个年轻的学徒  名叫达伦·克洛斯
I took on a young protege called Darren Cross.

712
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:08,980
达伦·克洛斯
Darren Cross.

713
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,170
他可是个大人物啊
He's a big deal.

714
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,810
但在他成为大人物之前  他是我的助手
But before he was a big deal, he was my assistant.

715
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,770
我觉得自己看中了他的某些特质
I thought I saw something in him.

716
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:16,820
甚至把他当自己儿子了吧
The son I never had, perhaps.

717
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,430
他很有才华  但当我们关系越来越近时
He was brilliant, but as we became close,

718
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,770
他开始怀疑我有事没告诉他
he began to suspect that I wasn't telling him everything.

719
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:27,140
他听到了关于皮姆微粒的传言
He heard rumors about what was called the Pym Particle,

720
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,190
从此开始着了魔般地想重现我的公式
and he became obsessed with recreating my formula.

721
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,760
但我不愿意帮他
But I wouldn't help him.

722
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,260
所以他背叛了我
So he conspired against me

723
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,880
投票把我赶出了我自己的公司
and he voted me out of my own company.

724
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,230
他是怎么做到的
How could he do that?

725
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,210
董事会的主席是我的女儿  霍普
The board's chairman is my daughter, Hope.

726
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,910
她投了决定性的一票
She was the deciding vote.

727
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,750
但当她看到克洛斯差不多就要
But she came back to me

728
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:48,750
重现我的公式时  她回到了我身边
when she saw how close Cross was to cracking my formula.

729
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,960
这整个过程非常的不稳定
The process is highly volatile.

730
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:55,160
假如没戴着特制的头盔
If one isn't protected by a specialized helmet,

731
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,240
有可能会影响到大脑的作用
it can affect the brain's chemistry.

732
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,280
我不认为达伦知道这一点
I don't think Darren realizes this,

733
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:03,610
再说了  他自己也没有多稳定
and, you know, he's not the most stable guy to begin with.

734
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:06,490
所以  你想要我做什么
So, what do you want from me?

735
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:12,500
斯科特  我相信人人都该有赎罪的机会
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption.

736
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,470
你相信吗
Do you?

737
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,610
相信
I do.

738
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:17,010
假如你能帮我的话
If you can help me,

739
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,870
我保证能帮你重新回到你女儿身边
I promise I can help you be with your daughter again.

740
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,350
现在  你准备好自我救赎了吗
Now, are you ready to redeem yourself?

741
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:25,950
百分百好了
Absolutely.

742
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,590
我那些入室盗窃的日子一去不复返了
My days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done.

743
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:32,210
您要我做什么
What do you want me to do?

744
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:35,830
我要你入室并且盗窃
I want you to break into a place and steal some shit.

745
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,700
你今晚回家吃晚饭吗
Are you gonna be home for dinner tonight?

Uh, yeah. I'll pick something up. Text me.

Okay. Good news?

我不知道  就是个消息
Uh... I don't know. It's news.

750
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:50,490
你是在试图找到我爸爸吗
Are you trying to find my daddy?

751
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,520
是的  甜心
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

752
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,360
我只是想确保你爸爸的安全
I just want your daddy to be safe.

希望你抓不到他
Hope you don't catch him.

754
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,360
这不是第一次这些人
This isn't the first time these guys

755
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,500
试图染指能改变世界格局的武器了
have tried to get their hands on game-changing weaponry.

756
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:54,010
那是米切尔·卡森  神盾局前任防御部长
That's Mitchell Carson, Ex-Head of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.

757
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:57,060
如今正赶着颠覆政府的勾当
Presently in the business of toppling governments.

758
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:59,400
他一直想要我的技术
He always wanted my tech.

759
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,760
除非我们能闯进去偷了黄衫
And now, unless we break in and steal the Yellowjacket

760
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,820
并且毁掉所有数据
and destroy all the data,

761
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:10,220
否则达伦·克洛斯就要掀起世界动乱了
Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world.

762
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:17,250
我觉得首先我们应该去向复仇者们求助
I think our first move should be calling the Avengers.

763
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,420
我花了大半辈子
I spent half my life

764
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:23,650
努力不让这项科技落入斯塔克手中
trying to keep this technology out of the hands of a Stark.

765
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,040
我现在也绝不会亲手把它交过去
I'm sure as hell not gonna hand-deliver it to one now.

766
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:30,580
这可不是钢铁侠战衣那种小儿科
This is not some cute technology like the Iron Man suit.

767
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,840
这个能改变现实的结构

Besides, they're probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky.

Okay, then why don't you just send the ants?

斯科特  它们只是蚂蚁
Scott, they are ants.

蚂蚁  它们能做很多事
Ants, they can do a lot of things,

773
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:49,360
但它们依然需要个领头的
but they still need a leader.

774

需要某人能渗透进

我是说  我是个很厉害的贼
I mean, i'm a good thief,

他说得对  汉克  你自己也清楚
He's right, Hank. And you know it.

你见过影像画面了
You've seen the footage,

00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,820
你知道克洛斯能干出些什么来
you know what Cross is capable of.

782
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:05,850
我几个月前就反对用他
I was against using him when we had months,

而如今我们只有几天了

我了解那栋建筑的里里外外
I know the facility inside and out.

787
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:13,220
我了解克洛斯的想法
I know how Cross thinks.

788
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,930
我比任何人都了解这项任务
I know this mission better than anybody here.

我们需要你待在克洛斯身边
We need you close to Cross.

不然的话  这项任务没办法成功的
Otherwise, this mission cannot work.

She's right, Hank.

我不是你要找的人
I'm not your guy.

00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,880
你为什么不自己穿呢
Why don't you wear the suit?

798
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:09,770
你以为我不想吗
You think I don't want to?

00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,480

I can't.

而这衣服对我产生了不良影响
and it took a toll on me.

你是唯一的人选
You're our only option.

在霍普失去她母亲前
Before Hope lost her mother,

她曾经视我为世界上最伟大的人
she used to look at me like I was the greatest man in the world.

It's too late for me,

但你不一样
but not for you.

00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,330
这是你的机会
This is your chance.

00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,170
重新赢得你女儿眼中的崇拜的机会
The chance to earn that look in your daughter's eyes.

810
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:02,000
不要辜负你在她心中的英雄形象
To become the hero that she already thinks you are.

811
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,880
这无关拯救我们的世界
It's not about saving our world.

812
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:08,440
而是事关拯救她们的
It's about saving theirs.

我需要你成为蚁人
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,540
正确地使用它
In the right hands,

817
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,880
人和衣服之间就会是一种共生关系
the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic.

818
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,600
衣服有力量  人则是利用那种力量
The suit has power. The man harnesses that power.

819
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:34,520
你需要变得灵巧  敏捷  最重要的是
You need to be skillful, agile, and above all,

820
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,960
你得要快
you need to be fast.

821
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:38,240
你要能够在极短的时间内缩小
You should be able to shrink and grow

822
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:39,300
和变大
on a dime.

823
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,820
让你的体型总能配合你的行动
So your size always suits your needs.

824
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,630
现在  穿过那个钥匙孔  斯科特
Now dive through the keyhole, Scott.

825
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,000
你起跑时是大的
You charge big,

826
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,090
然后变小穿过
you dive small,

827
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:50,700
之后再变大
then you emerge big.

828
00:49:58,330 --> 00:49:59,450
废物
Useless.

829
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:02,970
当你变小时  力量就被压缩了
When you're small, energy's compressed,

830
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,800
所以你180斤的男性的力量
so you have the force of a 200-pound man

831
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,120
放在了0.25毫米大的拳头后
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide.

832
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,380
你就像是一颗子弹
You're like a bullet.

833
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,000
你出拳太重了  会把人杀死
You punch too hard, you kill someone.

834
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,900
太轻了  就会像是爱抚
Too soft, it's a love tap.

835
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,370
换句话说  你得懂得如何出拳
In other words, you have to know how to punch.

836
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:15,260
在我监狱里待了三年  我知道怎么出拳
I was in prison for three years. I know how to punch.

837
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,140

00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:17,760

Terrible.

你想要给我演示一下如何出拳吗
You wanna show me how to punch?

840

841
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,410
这样出拳才对
That's how you punch.

00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:25,620
她一直等着这个呢
She's been looking forward to this.

843
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,530
真是呢
No kidding.

00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:08,910

我不知道为什么要来找你帮忙

你觉得这都是玩笑吗
Do you think this is a joke?

932
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,160
你知道他让你冒了多大的风险
Do you have any idea what he's asking you to risk?

933
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,310
你有个女儿
You have a daughter.

934
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:36,730
我做这些也是为了她
I'm doing this for her.

935
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:40,190
我妈妈去世时  我两周没见到他人
You know, when my mother died, I didn't see him for two weeks.

936
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,440
他肯定很伤心
He was in grief.

937
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,980
我也是  我当时才七岁

938
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:45,580
然后他再也没回来  没有真正回来
And he never came back. Not in any way that counted.

939
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,290
他直接把我送到寄宿学校
He just sent me off to boarding school.

940
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,110
要知道  我以为
You know, I thought,

941
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,100
这次危机
with all that's at stake,

942
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,070
可能是我们重归于好的机会
just maybe we might have a chance of making peace.

943
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:58,520
可事到如今他还是对我拒之千里
But, even now, he still wants to shut me out.

944
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,200
他不是想拒绝你  他信任你
He doesn't wanna shut you out. He trusts you.

945
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,660
那要你来干什么
Then why are you here?

946
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,570
来证明他爱你
It proves that he loves you.

947
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,550
霍普  看着我
Hope. Look at me.

948
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:11,110
我是来当炮灰的
I'm expendable.

949
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:13,260
找我就是为了这个
That's why I'm here.

950
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:16,550
你现在应该也意识到了
You must have realized that by now.

951
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:19,550
这就是为什么是我穿那套衣服而不是你
I mean, it's why I'm in the suit and you're not.

952
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,640
他宁愿全盘皆输也不愿意失去你
He would rather lose this fight than lose you.

953
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:26,660
所以说
Anyway...

954
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,800
我打电话报警的时候
You know, I didn't know you had a daughter

955
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:33,630
不知道你有个女儿
when I called the cops on you.

956
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:38,580
她叫什么
What's her name?

957
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,510
凯西
Cassie.

958
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:42,830
很美的名字
It's a pretty name.

959
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,090
你得整理思绪  斯科特
You have to clear your mind, Scott.

960
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:49,800
想法一定要明确
You have to make your thoughts precise.

961
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,080
这就是其中原理
That's how it works.

962
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,430
想想凯西
Think about Cassie.

963
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:57,860
想想你有多想见她  靠这个集中精力
About how badly you want to see her. And use that to focus.

964
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,530
睁开眼睛
Open your eyes

965
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:11,700
想想你想要蚂蚁们怎么做
and just think about what you want the ants to do.

966
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:35,090
做得好
That's good!

967
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,910
你母亲说服我
Your mother convinced me

968
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:59,070
让她也加入我的任务
to let her join me on my missions.

969
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:02,040
他们叫她黄蜂女
They called her the Wasp.

970
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:04,150
她手到擒来
She was born to it.

971
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:08,540
之后没有哪一天
And there's not a day that goes by

972
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,990
我不在后悔当初答应了她
that I don't regret having said yes.

973
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:18,070
那是1987年
It was 1987.

974
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:23,340
分裂派在苏联库斯科劫持了一个导弹发射井
Separatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

975
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:27,920
并向美国发射了一枚洲际导弹
and launched an ICBM at the United States.

976
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:37,910
进入导弹内部的唯一方式
The only way to the internal mechanics

977
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,660
就是穿过固态钛
was through solid titanium.

978
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:51,020
我知道我得缩小到
I knew I had to shrink

979
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:54,260
比分子还小  才能解除导弹
between the molecules to disarm the missile.

980
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,220
但我的调节器受损太重
But my regulator had sustained too much damage.

981
00:58:59,550 --> 00:59:00,570
你母亲
Your mother,

982
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,590
没有丝毫犹豫
she didn't hesitate.

983
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,020
简妮特  不要
Janet! No!

984
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,920
她关掉了她的调节器
She turned off her regulator

985
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,140
缩小到亚原子级
and went subatomic

986
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,430
解除了炸弹
to deactivate the bomb.

987
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:24,580
她牺牲了
And she was gone.

988
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,530
你妈妈是个英雄
Your mom died a hero.

989
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,330
接下来的十年时间
And I spent the next 10 years

990
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:41,090
我试图了解量子领域的一切
trying to learn all I could about the quantum realm.

991
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:46,480
你想把她找回来
You were trying to bring her back.

992
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:51,800
但我只了解到我们有多无知
But all I learned was we know nothing.

993
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:58,340
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

994
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,190
是她自己的选择
She made her choice.

995
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:10,240
但你为什么不早点告诉我
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

996
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,800
我是想保护你

你俩终于解除隔阂  重归于好

这很重要
It's important.

1004
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,920
我把气氛毁了  是不是
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

1005
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:43,540
没错  的确
Yes, you did. Yes.

1006

好样的  安东蚁

你训练的最后阶段是潜入

好冷
It's freezing!

1011
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,900
你不能在衣服里加层绒吗
You couldn't make a suit with a flannel lining?

1012
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:44,850
你得拿到这个信号诱饵的原型机

1013

我当年还在神盾局的时候研发的
It's a device that I invented during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

我们要用它来干扰
We need it to counteract the transmission blockers

1015
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:51,790
克洛斯在未来保险库装的通讯拦截器

现在正在霍华德·斯塔克的

1018
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:59,780
应该是小菜一碟
Should be a piece of cake.

1019
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:01,310
你在目标区域上空了
You're over the target area.

1020
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,920

All right, Ant-thony, please don't drop me this time.

1025
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:17,280
从搬糖块到干这个差距也太大了
Oh, it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this!

1026
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,430
保持冷静
Stay calm.

1027
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,570
伙计们  我们可能有麻烦了
Guys? We might have a problem.

1028
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,640
汉克  你不是说是个旧库房吗
Hank, didn't you say this was some old warehouse?

1029
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:27,540
它不是
It's not!

1030
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,170
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch!

1031
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:34,460
-斯科特  快回来  -任务中止

01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,140
没事  看着不像有人在
No, it's okay. It doesn't look like anyone's home.

1034
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:40,380
安东蚁  飞到屋顶去
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

1035
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:42,770
他要把衣服搞丢了
He's gonna lose the suit.

1036
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:44,440
他命都要丢了
He's gonna lose his life.

1037
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:52,090
好了  我到目标建筑的屋顶了

Somebody's home, Scott.

1039
01:02:58,190 --> 01:02:59,390
山姆  下面出什么事了
What's going on down there, Sam?

1040
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:00,640
是猎鹰
It's the Falcon!

1041
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:03,550
感应器说这里有东西  但我什么都没看到
I had a sensor trip but I'm not seeing anything.

1042
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:04,890

Wait a second.

1043
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:06,980
任务中止  斯科特  立刻中止

他看得到我
He can see me.

1047

你好  我是斯科特
Hi. I'm Scott.

1048
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,930
他刚直接自报家门了吗
Did he just say, "Hi, I'm Scott"?

1049
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:17,790
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

1050
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:20,240

我是蚁人
I'm Ant-Man.

1053
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,430
"蚁人"吗
"Ant-Man"?

1054
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:26,880
怎么  没听过我大名吗
What? You haven't heard of me?

1055
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,220
不  你是该没听过我
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.

1056
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:31,210
你要说明你是来干什么的吗
You wanna tell me what you want?

1057
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:33,650
我想过来拿个仪器
I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology.

1058
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:35,370
借用几天  用完就还
Just for a few days. I'm gonna return it.

1059
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:38,190
我得拿去拯救世界  你懂的
I need it to save the world. You know how that is.

1060
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,020
我确实懂
I know exactly how that is.

1061
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:41,590
锁定入侵者
Located the breach.

1062
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:43,410
-马上逮捕他  -对不住了
- Bringing him in. - Sorry about this!

1063
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:49,560
你他妈在干什么
What the hell are you doing?

1064
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:53,370
入侵者为成年男性
Breach is an adult male,

1065
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:55,420
好像有某种缩小装置
who has some sort of shrinking tech.

1066
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:08,940
抱歉
Sorry!

1067
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,250
听着  我真的很抱歉  对不起
Look, I'm sorry about this. Sorry.

1068
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,080
够了
That's enough!

1069
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:37,210
安东蚁  帮下忙
Ant-thony! A little help!

1070
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,210
我看不见你了
I've lost visual.

1071
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:01,850
他在我的翅膀里
He's inside my pack!

1072
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:02,750
抱歉
Sorry!

1073
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:05,710
你看起来人很好
You seem like a really great guy.

1074
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:34,650
这事绝对不能被队长知道
It's really important to me that Cap never finds out about this.

1075
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:41,140
你刚那也太不负责而且很危险
That was completely irresponsible and dangerous!

1076
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,340
你威胁到了全盘计划
You jeopardized everything!

1077
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,190
你拿到了
You got it.

1078

干得好

1079
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:06,910
等一下
Wait a minute.

1080
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:08,540
你刚是在表扬我吗
Did you just compliment me?

1081
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,530
他表扬我了  是吧
He did, didn't he?

1082
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:11,000
听起来是的
Kind of sounded like he did.

1083
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,520
我以前很厉害吧
I was good, wasn't I?

1084
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:19,000
还有我跟一个复仇者干了一架还没死
Hey, how about the fact that I fought an Avenger and didn't die?

1085
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,550
别沉溺于往事
Let us not dwell on the past.

1086
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:23,780
还得完成计划
We gotta finish our planning.

1087
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,600
别在意他
Don't mind him.

1088
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:29,660
你做得很好
You did good.

1089

达伦
Darren.

1090
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:42,250
你是怎么进来的
How the hell did you get in here?

1091
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:45,870
前门没锁  汉克
You left the front door open, Hank.

1092
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:47,530
这回是真的了
It's official.

01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:48,720

他会杀了他
He will kill him.

1096
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:59,180
你有何贵干
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?

1097
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:01,880
我有好消息
I have good news.

1098
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:02,860
是吗
Really?

1099
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:04,980
是什么
What's that?

1100
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:09,790
皮姆科技  你一手建立的公司
Pym Tech, the company you created,

1101
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,520
马上要成为世界上

1102

光是明天的买卖就能赚150亿
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales, tomorrow alone.

1104
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:25,840
不用谢了
You're welcome.

1105
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:32,770
我知道很奇怪  但我想你也在场
I know this is odd, but I'd like you to be there.

1106
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,340
那是我的时刻  我想让你也看到
This is my moment. I want you to see it.

1107
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:37,990
好的  达伦  可以
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

1108
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:39,100
我会到场的
I'll be there.

1109
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:57,630
你看中我什么了
What did you see in me?

1110
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:00,170
我不懂你什么意思
I don't know what you mean.

1111
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,400
多年以前  你选中了我
All those years ago, you picked me.

1112
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:05,200
你看到了什么
What did you see?

1113
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:09,420
我看到了我自己
I saw myself.

1114
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:11,820
那你为什么又把我推开
Then why did you push me away?

1115
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:17,220
因为你太像我了
Because I saw too much of myself.

1116
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:29,780
他知道了  那是陷阱
He knows. He's baiting you.

1117
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:31,340
我们得中止计划
We have to call it off.

1118
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:32,890
我们都在冒险
We're all taking risks.

1119
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:34,030
要是他看到我在这里怎么办
What if he saw me here?

1120
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:35,310
他没看到的  没有可能
He didn't. There's no way.

1121
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:36,840
你怎么能确定
How do you know that?

1122
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:41,090
{\an8}{\pos(188,112)}达伦·克洛斯

1123

我在家  怎么了
I'm at home. Why?

1126
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:52,900
我刚去见汉克了
I just saw Hank.

1127
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:55,080
他还是和以前一样轻视我
I still get nothing but contempt from him.

1128
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:58,610
别跟他生气  他就是个糟老头
Don't let him rile you up. He's just a senile old man.

1129
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,100
所有人都要加班加点的工作
We need to start everyone working around the clock.

1130
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,060
马上准备运行生产线
Get the assembly line up and running.

1131
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,870
我要加强警备
And I'm tripling security.

1132
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:06,810
所有入口都要设感应器
Full sensors at all entrances

1133
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:10,160
通风口都装上钢制微孔筛
and exterior air vents fitted with steel micro-mesh.

1134
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,940
好的  好主意
Great. Good idea.

1135
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:15,080
谢谢你  霍普  有你在我这边真幸运
Thank you, Hope. I'm so lucky to have you on my team.

1136
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:22,970
他要加强警备  他已经疯了还盯上你了
He's tripling security. He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

1137
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:25,200
但他没有盯上你
But he is not onto you.

1138
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,690
他要在所有入口加装人体扫描仪
He's adding full body scanners to all entrances

1139
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:29,640
还要关闭外部通风口
and closing exterior vents.

1140
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:31,500
斯科特怎么进去
How are we gonna get Scott inside?

1141
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:34,440
总水管
The water main.

1142
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,800
你没法加强总水管的安保措施
You can't add security to a water main.

1143
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:40,100
水压太强了  但要是我们能减弱水压
The pressure is too strong, but if we can decrease it,

1144
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,210
我就能进去
that's how I get in.

1145
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:43,690
得有人在大楼的控制中心
Somebody would have to reach the building's control center

1146
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:45,000
去调节水压
to change the water pressure.

1147
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,420
我和汉克得陪在克洛斯身边
Hank and I will be beside Cross.

1148
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:47,690
我们根本不可能做到
How are we supposed to do that?

1149
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:49,410
我们要招兵买马了
So we expand our team.

1150
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:51,140
需要哪些人呢
What do we need?

1151
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:52,980
内部要安插一名假保安
A fake security guard on the inside

1152
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,430
负责进入供水系统降压
to de-pressurize the water system,

1153
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:58,070
另一个人要侵入供电系统切断激光光束
somebody else to hack in to the power supply and kill the laser grid,

1154
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,590
还要一个人接应我们逃跑
and a getaway guy.

1155
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:04,620
不不不  那三个蠢货不行  绝对不行
No, no. No, no, no. Not those three wombats. No way.

1156
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:06,540
谢谢您的咖啡  女士
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.

1157
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:10,120
很少会有人被打劫了还邀请劫匪坐坐
It's not too often that you rob a place and then get welcomed back.

1158
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,710
因为我们打劫了你
Because we just robbed you.

1159
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:17,540
你知道他是因为偷了台冰沙机被捕的吧
You know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie machine, right?

1160
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,680
是两台冰沙机
Two smoothie machines.

1161
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,120
你确定他们能胜任吗
Are you sure they can handle this?

1162
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,810
肯定可以  我们可是专业的
Oh, we can handle it. We're professionals.

1163
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:25,630
请原谅我们对你们没什么信心
You'll forgive us if we're not instilled with confidence.

1164
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:28,250
各位都先冷静一下  淡定淡定
Well, hey, everybody just kick back and relax a little bit, man.

1165
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:29,630
我们懂这行
We know our business.

1166
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:32,180
我们可闯入过这老房子  不是吗
We broke into this spooky-ass house, didn't we?

1167
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:33,380
是我放你们进来的
I let you.

1168
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:36,680
那也可以说是我让你放我进来的
Well, one could say that I let you let me.

1169
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,370
没事  他们能搞定
Look, it's okay. They can handle this.

1170
01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:40,260
对  我们能搞定
Yeah, we can handle it.

1171
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:42,200
-你有他们的证件了吗  -他在系统里了
- You got their credentials? - He's in the system.

1172
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,400
我在系统里了
I'm in the system?

1173
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:44,850
你在系统里了
You're in the system.

1174
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,060
系统里吗
The system?

1175
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:48,280
好吧  我们死定了
Yeah, we're doomed.

1176
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:51,250
好了  有样东西要给你们看看
All right. There's something you guys need to see.

1177
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,110
等你走到这个转角
When you get to this corner,

1178
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:56,250
你的左侧会有三间办公室
there's gonna be three offices on your left side.

1179
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:57,300
我操
Damn!

1180
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:01,840
真是太酷炫了  哥们
Whoa! That's so cool, bro!

1181
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,430
听着  过一会儿会很诡异
Now, look, this is gonna get weird, all right?

1182
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:06,430
会很吓人  但其实没事
It's pretty freaky, but it's safe.

1183
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:07,930
不必害怕
There's no reason to be scared.

1184
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,560
不不  老子我天不怕地不怕
Oh, no, no. Daddy don't get scared.

1185
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:11,090
-真的吗  -真的
- Really? - Yeah.

1186
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,100
那就好
Good.

1187
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,400
绝对是吉普赛人搞的鬼把戏
This is the work of Gypsies.

1188
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,670
这是巫术吧
That's witchcraft.

1189
01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:23,920
太厉害了
Wow, that's amazing.

1190
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,160
感觉就像大卫·科波菲尔那样
That's like some David Copperfield shit.

1191
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,280
这是什么魔法吧
That's some kind of wizardry.

1192
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,400
是巫术
This is sorcery!

1193
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,430
哥们  你是怎么做到的
How'd you do that, bro?

1194
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:32,160
千万别怕  看看你的肩膀
Don't freak out. Look at your shoulder.

1195
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:35,100
滚开  滚开
Get off! Get off!

1196
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,170
你不是还说你天不怕地不怕吗
Wait, I thought Daddy didn't get scared!

1197
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:41,260
我让每人吃了半片镇静剂
I gave them each half a Xanax

1198
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:43,760
汉克还给他们解释这套衣服的原理呢
and Hank explained the science of the suit to them.

1199
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:45,300
他们就睡着了
They fell right asleep.

1200
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:49,140
听着  我很感谢你能...
Hey, look, I wanna thank you for...

1201
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:50,390
不  别谢我
No, please don't.

1202
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:54,070
我们这么做都是为了大义
We're all doing this for reasons much bigger than any one of us.

1203
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:55,130
我只是很高兴你还有
I'm just glad that you might have

1204
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:57,800
那么一丝机会可能会成功
a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.

1205
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,250
谢谢你为我打气
Hey, thank you, you know, for that pep talk.

1206
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,200
老实说  我已经从原来的瞧不起你
You know, the honest truth is, I actually went from despising you

1207
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,130
变得快开始喜欢你了
to almost liking you.

1208
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:07,300
你真的应该去写诗
You really should write poetry.

1209
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,130
去睡会吧  斯科特
Get some sleep, Scott.

1210
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:03,890
好了  确定一下
All right, just so we're clear,

1211
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:05,650
我们都清楚自己的任务了吧
everyone here knows their role, right?

1212
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:07,270
-戴夫  -负责驾车逃跑
- Dave? - Wheels on the ground.

1213
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:08,770
-科特  -负责搞定监控
- Kurt? - Eyes in the sky.

1214
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:10,240
-路易斯  -你懂的
- Luis? - Oh, man, you know it.

1215
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,730
没错  我要穿制服
You know what? I get to wear a uniform.

1216
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:13,300
-就是这样  -路易斯
- That's what's up. - Luis.

1217
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,630
抱歉  我清楚任务  我只是太兴奋了
I'm sorry. I'm good. I'm good. I'm just excited.

1218
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:16,790
而且你的女朋友真的很性感
Plus, your girlfriend's really hot.

1219
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:18,350
看到她我也会特别紧张
So, you know, that makes me nervous, too.

1220
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:19,560
你真的很漂亮  女士
And you are very beautiful, ma'am.

1221
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:21,110
-我的天哪  -她不是我的...
- Oh, my Lord. - She's not my...

1222
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:22,570
对了  我想到个策略
You know what? I was thinking of a tactic,

1223
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:24,040
我卧底进去时可以用
like when I go undercover.

1224
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,220
比如吹口哨  你懂我的意思吧  融入进去
Like a whistling. You know what I'm saying? To like, blend in.

1225
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:28,740
不行  别吹口哨  不准吹
No. Don't whistle. No whistling.

1226
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:31,130
这又不是表演才艺节目  不准吹
It's not The Andy Griffith Show. No whistling.

1227
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:50,300
一区一切正常
All clear in Sector One.

1228
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:56,430
进来
Step out.

1229
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:00,190
没问题
All clear.

1230
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,030
准备就绪
We're set.

1231
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:08,660
祝我好运
Wish me luck.

1232
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,040
设备上线
Utilities online.

1233
01:14:34,730 --> 01:14:36,420
你在干什么
Hey! What are you doing?

1234
01:14:36,990 --> 01:14:41,240
头儿让我来检查下这  我就来了
Uh... Boss-man said to secure the area, so I'm securing it.

1235
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:44,230
我就是头儿
I'm the boss.

1236
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:46,630
控制室1.3
Utilities 1.3...

1237
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,220
水位正在下降
Water level is dropping!

1238
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:32,460
爬到抽气管上
Coming up on extraction pipe.

1239
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:34,310

All right, I see it.

1240
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:43,340
拜托了  我得爬上去
All right, come on, I gotta get up there.

1241
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:46,170
没错  没错  就是这样
That's it. That's it, guys! Yes!

1242
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:51,430
没错  我们做到了  做到了  快点
Yes! You got it! You got it! Come on!

1243
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:58,220
好了  起飞吧  安东蚁
All right, let's fly, Ant-thony.

1244
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:11,430
蚁人进入大楼了
The Ant-Man is in the building.

1245

皮姆刚到  时间正好
Pym's pulling up. Right on time.

1246
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:18,230
外面还有辆福特皇冠
Got a Crown Vic right outside there.

1247
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:19,410
有什么问题吗
This is problem?

1248
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:21,770
福特皇冠是卧底警察
Considering the Crown Vic's the most commonly used car

1249
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:23,540
最常开的车
for undercover cops, man,

1250
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:25,450
没错  出问题了
yes, this is problem.

1251
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,480
是皮姆
That's Pym.

1252
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:34,040
不
Oh, no.

1253
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,510
我在部署子弹蚂蚁
I'm deploying the bullet ants.

1254
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:37,340
拟猛蚁亚科什么什么蚁
Paraponera clavata de Merna Merna...

1255
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:39,860
不记得学名叫什么  但这人惨了
I don't remember what it's called, but I feel bad for this guy.

1256
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:53,440
瞧瞧  这还差不多
See? That's what I'm talking about.

1257
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,250
这就是我所说的在严肃的
That's what I call an unfortunate casualty

1258
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:58,000
行动中不幸的受害者
in a very serious operation.

1259
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,930
信号诱饵就位
Signal decoy in place.

1260
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:12,290
凶巴巴美女也搞定了  斯科特
Mean, pretty lady did good, Scott.

1261
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:15,830
看来皮姆被逮捕了
Looks like Pym's getting arrested.

1262
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:17,390
斯科特  出问题了
Scott, we have problem.

1263
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,190
问题  什么问题
Problem? What's the problem?

1264
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:22,880
戴夫  戴夫  我们可没这计划
Dave! Dave, that's not part of plan!

1265
01:17:22,890 --> 01:17:23,810
听我说
Listen to me.

1266
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:27,960
如果我不进这大楼  有人就会死
If I don't get into this building, people will die.

1267
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,720
有那么夸张吗
That's awfully dramatic.

1268
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:34,730
是不是在逗我
Are you kidding me?

1269
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,660
问题解决了
Problem solved.

1270
01:17:58,880 --> 01:17:59,940

刚刚好  走吧
Just in time. Come on.

01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,940
十二项验证
12-point verification.

1274
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:29,110
有点过头了  你不觉得吗  达伦
Little over-the-top, don't you think, Darren?

1275
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:30,350
正在确认授权
Confirming authorization level.

1276
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:32,170
防范于未然嘛
Well, you can never be too safe.

You really did it.

1280
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:46,850
这还只是一部分  汉克
And you only know the half of it, Hank.

1281
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:14,820
前往第二目标位置
Arriving in second position.

继续向指定位置前进
Proceeding to command position.

1284
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:50,190
我马上就回来  安东蚁

1285

好了  各位  我到了

01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:08,680
各就各位
Assume formation.

1290
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:10,930
好了  你们这些可爱的小家伙
All right, you cute little crazies,

1291

1292
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:26,830
上吧兄弟们
Let's go get 'em, buddy!

1293
01:20:39,730 --> 01:20:40,950
服务器已被毁坏
Servers are fried.

1294
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:43,010
备份数据均已被擦除
Data backup completely erased.

1295
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:44,700
正在前往粒子实验室
Heading to the particle chamber.

1296
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:53,090
你好  克洛斯博士
Hello, Dr. Cross.

1297
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:59,560
我的伙伴们答应了你的条件
My associates have agreed to your terms.

1298
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,630
太好了
Wonderful.

1299
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:03,120
卡森先生向这几位先生引荐了我
Mr. Carson introduced me to these fine gentlemen here.

1300
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,110
他们是九头蛇的代表们
They're representatives of Hydra.

1301
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,600
他们不是曾经那样了
They're not what they were.

1302
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,280
他们正在进行有趣的工作
They're doing some interesting work.

1303
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:10,510
而我也很享受这样
And I'm enjoying myself.

1304
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:14,400
你一直把技术藏起来不给我
You tried to hide your technology from me.

1305
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,050
现在你自食恶果了吧
And now it's gonna blow up in your face.

1306
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:25,470
我早就预料到你会出拳揍我
I mean, I saw that punch coming a mile away,

1307
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:27,860
可我还以为这一拳会很软弱无力呢
but I just figured it'd be all pathetic and weak.

1308
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:29,510
那你想错了
Well, you figured wrong.

1309
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:31,770
我见过这辆车
I know this van.

1310
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:34,590
有人吗
Anybody home?

1311
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,380
好了各位  我到了
All right, guys. I'm here.

1312
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,750
正在安装炸弹
I'm setting the charges.

1313
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:09,520
各位干得很好  接下来交给我吧
Great job, guys. I'll take it from here.

1314
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:20,330
安东蚁  辛苦了
Good boy, Ant-thony.

1315
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:23,630
最后目标位
Final position.

1316
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,270
各位  激光光栅关了吗
Guys, how we looking on that laser grid?

1317
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:35,900
-快了  -并没搞定
- Almost. - No, you're not.

1318
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:38,030
-马上就好了  -并没有
- I'm getting close! - No, you're not.

1319
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:43,740
旧金山警察局
San Francisco P.D.!

1320
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:45,080
从车里出来
Out of the van!

1321
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:46,550
我知道你们在里面
I know you're in there!

1322
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:47,330
再快点
Make it go faster.

1323
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:49,160
哥们  别再催我了
Dude, seriously.

1324
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,630
准备跃入  听到没  科特
Ready to jump. Do you read, Kurt?

1325
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,310
马上就好
So close.

1326
01:22:58,370 --> 01:22:59,810
-等等  再等一会  -别动
- Okay, hold up! Wait a minute! - Freeze!

1327
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:01,340
有个和我长得一模一样的黑人
There was a black guy that looked exactly like me

1328
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:03,550
袭击了我们  把我们关进这破车里
who attacked us and put us in the back of this disgusting van.

1329
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:05,210
-给我出来  -我这不是在出来嘛
- Get out of the van! - Okay, I'm coming.

1330
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:06,340
别紧张
Take it easy!

1331
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,700
我不走  快上
No, I will not move! Go now!

1332
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:11,720
等等
Wait!

1333
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,480
什么  为什么又要等等
What? What do you mean, "Wait"?

1334
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:24,970
搞什么
What? What?

1335
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:27,630
小家伙
Hey, little guy.

1336
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:43,440
我一直都怀疑你还偷藏了一套衣服
I always suspected you had a suit stored away somewhere.

1337
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:44,680
那么问题来了
Which begs the question,

1338
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,960
这位新蚁人是谁
who is the new Ant-Man?

1339
01:23:47,090 --> 01:23:50,890
这位让我敬爱的导师更加信任的人是谁
Who is the man that my beloved mentor trusted even more than me?

1340
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:55,830
斯科特·朗
Scott Lang.

1341
01:23:57,010 --> 01:23:58,560
殉道者
A martyr

1342
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,180
反抗了社会也付出了代价
who took on the system and paid the price,

1343
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:05,250
失去了他的家庭和他唯一的女儿
losing his family and his only daughter in the process.

1344
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:08,050
正好是你的口味  汉克
Exactly your kind of guy, Hank!

1345
01:24:09,390 --> 01:24:14,750
他越了狱  没有留下任何线索
He escapes his jail cell without leaving any clue as to how.

1346
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:18,440
然后神奇地消失了
And then he disappears magically,

1347
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,360
虽然身上一分钱都没有
despite having no money to his name.

1348
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,770
现在他把蚁人服带来了
And now he brings me the Ant-Man suit.

1349
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:30,490
唯一能与我的发明相提并论的设计
The only thing that can rival my creation.

1350
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:33,600
达伦  别这么做
Darren, don't do this.

1351
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:35,940
如果你把它卖给这些人
If you sell to these men,

1352
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:37,530
一定会引发世界混乱
it's gonna be chaos.

1353
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:39,010
我已经卖了
I already have.

1354
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:40,470
而且多亏了你
And for twice the price,

1355
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:41,570
卖了两倍的价格
thanks to you.

1356
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:45,890
要成功侵入复联大楼可不容易
It's not easy to successfully infiltrate an Avengers facility.

1357
01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:48,500
庆幸的是  消息传千里
Thankfully, word travels fast.

1358
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,820
我会把黄衫卖给他们
I'll sell them the Yellowjacket,

1359
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:52,460
不过粒子我就自己留着了
but I'm keeping the particle to myself.

1360
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:54,480
这可不烧柴油
They don't run on diesel.

1361
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,000
如果想要燃料  就得来找我
If you want the fuel, you'll have to come to me.

1362
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,340
你会怎么称呼全世界
What do you call the only man

1363
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:04,000
唯一一位手握最强大武器的人
who can arm the most powerful weapon in the world?

1364
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,020
世界上最强大的人
The most powerful man in the world.

1365
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:08,160
你为我感到自豪了吗
You proud of me yet?

1366
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:11,540
现在收手还来得及  达伦
You can stop this, Darren. It's not too late.

1367
01:25:11,550 --> 01:25:14,330
早已经来不及了
It's been too late for a long time now.

1368
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:16,900
达伦
Darren!

1369
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,460
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1370
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:23,720
他照顾不好你  就像你也照顾不好我
He wasn't any more capable of caring for you than he was for me.

1371
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:25,500
这不是原来的你
This is not who you are.

1372
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:28,590
你的大脑化学物质被粒子改变了
It's the particles altering your brain chemistry.

1373
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:38,490
等等  等等
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1374
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:43,550
你说得对  必须我亲自动手
You're right. I have to be the one to do it.

1375
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:47,000
好戏来了
Here we go.

1376
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,680
把  枪  放  下
Drop your gun.

1377
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:56,900
那天晚上我去他家本来是想杀他
You know, I came to the house the other night to kill him,

1378
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:58,520
可你当时也在
but you were there.

1379
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:02,090
你走火入魔了  我能帮你  把枪放下
You're sick and I can help you. Just put the gun down.

1380
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:03,720
我当时还没想杀你
I wasn't ready to kill you then,

1381
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:06,280
但我现在准备好了
but I think I am now!

1382
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:08,700
把枪放下
Drop your gun now!

1383
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,940
你站错队了  霍普
You picked the wrong side, Hope.

1384
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:25,850
爸爸
Dad!

1385
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:35,960
汉克  不
Hank, no.

1386
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,450
不  汉克
No, Hank.

1387
01:26:38,470 --> 01:26:40,660
汉克  听着  你会没事的
Hank? Listen, you're gonna be okay.

1388
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:42,430
你会没事的
All right? You're gonna be just fine.

1389
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:47,050
把衣服脱了  不然我一枪崩了你再扒衣服
Take the suit off, or I'll blow your brains out and peel it off.

1390
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,950
{\an8}皮姆科技

1391
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:13,930
皮姆科技公司发生紧急情况

请求紧急支援

1393
01:27:16,090 --> 01:27:17,100

1396
01:27:33,550 --> 01:27:36,130
我去把直升机准备好
I want to make sure the helicopter is ready to take off.

1397

你们俩
You two,

1398
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:40,420
从保险库出来的东西一律格杀勿论
kill anything that comes out of that vault!

1399
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:43,560
爸  你能动吗
Dad, can you move?

1400
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:47,160
我们得带他离开这里
We need to get him out of here.

01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:51,620
去拿衣服
Go get that suit.

我是不是救了你的小命
Hey, did I save your life?

1404
01:28:38,370 --> 01:28:39,220
斯科蒂
Scotty?

1405
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:40,960

1409
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,270

1410
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:51,180

Feels kinda weird, you know.

1411
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:53,290
嗯  但任务还没结束

在爆炸之前快离开这里
Get out of here before this place blows!

1413
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:05,010

Damn it! That guy.

1414
01:29:06,730 --> 01:29:08,910

你也不会的
And neither are you.

1420
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,450
这可不是钥匙链
It's not a keychain.

1421
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:32,840
这里乱成一团了  枪声四起
It's total chaos in here! Multiple shots fired!

1422
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:44,760
还有一辆坦克
And there's a tank.

1423
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:55,330
谁能帮我一下
A little help!

1424
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:58,280
我来
I got it.

1425

1431
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:44,570
你会后悔的

1434
01:30:58,210 --> 01:31:00,240
太吵了  有辆坦克  我听不清你说话
It's too loud, there's a tank. I can't hear you!

1435
01:31:08,570 --> 01:31:10,630
你疯了吗  把枪放下
Are you crazy? Put the gun down!

窗户
The windows!

1437
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:19,210
你觉得靠抢劫能阻止未来吗
Did you think you could stop the future with a heist?

1438
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:21,870
根本就不止是抢劫
It was never just a heist!

1439
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:44,570
把枪放下
Put the gun down!

1440
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:55,860
发现他了  在那里  快快快
Okay, I got him, I got him. There he is! Go, go, go!

你得帮你爸爸赎罪
You have to help Daddy pay for his mistakes.

You stay behind me, okay?

1503
01:39:33,010 --> 01:39:34,160

1504
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:38,420
我得缩小到比分子还小才能进去
I'm gonna have to shrink between the molecules to get in there.

1505
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:40,130
离我们远点
Get away from us!

1506
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:43,400
爸爸  救命

你会变成亚原子级
You would go subatomic.

1511

你会进入一个现实
You would enter a reality

1513
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:42,300
在那里一切关于时间和空间的概念
where all concepts of time and space...

1514
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:43,600
没有意义了
become irrelevant...

1515
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:46,730
都没有意义了
become irrelevant...

1516
01:40:48,530 --> 01:40:51,780
一切关于时间和空间的概念都没有意义了
all concepts of time and space become irrelevant...

1517

爸爸  回来
Come back, Daddy!

1518
01:40:59,430 --> 01:41:05,000
因为你会不断缩小
as you shrink for all eternity...

01:41:07,830 --> 01:41:09,330
你所知
Everything that you know

1520
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:13,090
和所爱的一切
and love,

1521

gone forever.

1522
01:41:15,890 --> 01:41:19,130
爸爸  你在哪里

你在哪里啊
Where are you?

1525
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:45,580
-爸爸  -凯西

1526
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:54,860
爸爸  回来
Come back, Daddy!

1527
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:01,850
不要乱动调节器
Do not screw with the regulator!

1528
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:33,720
爸爸
Daddy!

1529
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:38,780

1531
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:42,260
很爱很爱
So much.

1532
01:42:46,570 --> 01:42:48,690
房顶上有个大洞
You know, there's a big hole in the roof.

1533
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:52,440
抱歉
Sorry.

1534
01:42:55,610 --> 01:42:57,470
-她没事吧  -嗯  她没事

Mommy!

1536
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:05,430
她没事  她没事
She's fine, she's fine.

1537
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:15,760
拜托  斯科特
Scott, please.

1538
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:18,490
你什么都不记得了吗
You don't remember anything?

1539
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:20,260
汉克  我记不得了
Hank. I don't.

1540
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:21,920
肯定还有些什么的
There must be something else.

1541
01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:26,310
好吧  我觉得人类的大脑
Well, I suppose the human mind

1542
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:29,860
是没法理解这种经历的
just can't comprehend the experience,

1543
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:33,180
但你却成功了
but you made it.

1544
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:35,040
你进去以后
You went in,

1545
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:38,540
又出来了
and you got out.

1546
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:42,160
真棒
It's amazing.

1547
01:43:43,130 --> 01:43:44,090
斯科特
Scott,

1548
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:46,130
我带你出去
I'll walk you out.

1549

好好休息
Get some rest.

1550
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:02,260
这真的有可能吗
Is it possible?

1551
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:21,730
什么时候的事
When did this happen?

1552
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:23,140
没什么事
Nothing's happening.

1553
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:25,580
等等  算是有点什么事吧
Whoa. Hold on. Something's kind of happening.

1554
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:27,640
要真是这样
Well, if that's the case,

1555
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:28,930
再给我来一枪
shoot me again.

1556
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:30,690
我不知道你刚在干嘛
Yeah. I don't know what you were doing,

1557
01:44:30,690 --> 01:44:32,030
对我又抱又亲的
grabbing and kissing me like that.

1558
01:44:32,030 --> 01:44:33,960
我也有点小惊讶呢
I'm a little surprised myself.

1559
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:36,690
我得去个地方  一会见  汉克
I have to get somewhere. I'll see you later, Hank.

1560
01:44:36,690 --> 01:44:37,720
霍普  你真是的
Really, Hope.

1561
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:39,810
斯科特
Scott.

1562
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:42,670
-满嘴胡话  -没错
- You're full of shit. - Oh, yeah.

1563
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:45,730
斯科特  我今天见了我们警监

他想要你出狱那晚的报告

摄像头出现了故障
Something happened with the cameras.

1566

1567
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:57,170
但我跟他说你是走正规程序出去的
But I told him that you were processed correctly.

1568
01:44:57,420 --> 01:44:58,290
真的吗
Really?

1569
01:44:58,680 --> 01:44:59,560
是的
Well, yeah.

1570
01:45:01,010 --> 01:45:04,810
不能因为电子故障就把凯西的爸爸送回监狱  对吧
Can't be sending Cassie's dad back to jail on a technical glitch, right?

1571
01:45:04,810 --> 01:45:05,960

1576
01:45:19,420 --> 01:45:20,290
好尴尬
This is awkward.

1577
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:21,790
-没错  -没错
- Yeah.  - Yeah.

1578
01:45:21,860 --> 01:45:24,330
这事之后我们还有什么可谈的呢
I mean, what do we even talk about after all of that?

1579
01:45:24,330 --> 01:45:25,690
-我知道  -什么
- Oh, I know. - What?

1580
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:27,590
我今天第一次横翻筋斗
I did my first cartwheel today.

1581
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:28,330

我用手机录下来了  看
I recorded it on my phone. Here.

1585
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:37,640
不  这不可能是凯西  这不是你
No, that can't be Cassie. That's not you.

1586
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:38,590
是她
Yeah, it is.

1587
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:41,220
这分明是专业体操运动员  不可能是你
This is a professional gymnast. There is no way that's you.

1588
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:42,620
的确就是她
Yeah, that's her.

1589
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:45,250
好狗狗
Good boy.

工作上的事
It's work.

好的
All right.

1594

这样吧  把事实告诉我
Here's the deal. Just give me the facts.

1595
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:05,110
讲重点  只讲重点
Just the facts. Only the facts.

1596

呼气  专注  简简单单
Breathe. Focus. Keep it simple.

1597
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:10,570
行  行  没问题的
No, no, no. No doubt, no doubt. Okay.

1598
01:46:10,570 --> 01:46:13,140
我和我表哥伊格纳西奥去艺术馆
So, I'm at this art museum with my cousin Ignacio, right?

1599
01:46:13,150 --> 01:46:15,200
是一个抽象表现主义的展览
And there was this, like, abstract expressionism exhibit.

1600
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:17,490
但你知道的  我比较喜欢新立体主义的作品
But you know me, I'm more like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right?

1601
01:46:17,490 --> 01:46:20,530
但有个人叫罗斯科的人非常棒  天呐
But there was this one Rothko that was sublime, bro! Oh, my God!

1602
01:46:20,530 --> 01:46:21,660
路易斯
Luis.

1603
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:22,750
好了  抱歉  抱歉
Okay, sorry. Sorry.

1604
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:24,900
我就是太兴奋了
You know, I just get excited and stuff.

1605
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:26,690
但不管怎么说  伊格纳西奥告诉我
But anyway, Ignacio tells me,

1606
01:46:26,690 --> 01:46:28,320
"我昨晚在焦点酒吧
"Yo, I met this crazy-fine writer chick

1607
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:30,370
遇到一个超正点的作家妹子  超级正点
at the Spot last night. Like fine-fine.

1608
01:46:30,370 --> 01:46:31,920
特别特别正点  然后他
Like crazy-stupid fine." And he

1609
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:33,040
过去跟酒保说
goes up to the bartender and goes,

1610
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:34,590
看那个和我一起的妹子  懂我意思不
"Look at the girl I'm with. You know what I'm sayin'?

1611
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:35,680
她超正的  对吧
"She's crazy-stupid fine, right?"

1612
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:38,830
酒保说  是啊  的确超正
The bartender's all like, "Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."

1613
01:46:38,830 --> 01:46:40,840
所以这个作家妹子告诉伊格纳西奥
So this writer chick tells Ignacio,

1614
01:46:40,850 --> 01:46:43,680
我可是小道八卦界女王
"Yo, I'm like a boss in the world of guerrilla journalism,

1615
01:46:43,690 --> 01:46:45,660
我和幕后大佬关系可好了
"And I got mad connects with the peeps behind the curtains,

1616
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:46,420
你懂我说得不
"You know what I'm saying?"

1617
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:47,990
伊格纳西奥就问  真的呀
Ignacio's like, "For real?"

1618
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:49,580
她说  真的啊
And she's like, "Yeah, you know what,

1619
01:46:49,580 --> 01:46:50,850
我不能告诉你我线人是谁
I can't tell you who my contact is,

1620
01:46:50,850 --> 01:46:52,700
因为他和复联一起工作
"Because he works with the Avengers."

1621
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:53,900
天呐
Oh, no.

1622
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:56,500
这人听上去很厉害呢
Yeah, and this dude sounds like a badass, man.

1623
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:57,620
他走过去跟她说
Like, he comes up to her and says,

1624
01:46:57,620 --> 01:46:59,500
"我在找个超级英雄界的新人
"Yo, I'm looking for this dude who's new on the scene,

1625
01:46:59,510 --> 01:47:00,960
"刚初来乍到
"who's flashing his fresh tack,

1626
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:03,540
"技能出众的人  你知道谁吗"
"who's got, like, bomb moves, right? Who you got?"

1627
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:05,640
她说  什么人都有啊
And she's like, "Well, we got everything nowaday.

1628
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:06,760
有会蹦的
We got a guy who jumps.

1629
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:09,160
会飞的  还有爬墙的
"We got a guy who swings, we got a guy who crawls up the walls.

1630
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:10,220
你得说具体点
"You gotta be more specific."

1631
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:12,620
他说  我要找个能缩小的
And he's like, "I'm looking for a guy that shrinks."

1632
01:47:12,620 --> 01:47:14,530
我说  靠  我很紧张
And I'm, like, "Damn!". I got all nervous

1633
01:47:14,530 --> 01:47:16,190
因为我要为你保守秘密
'cause I'd keep mad secrets for you, bro.

1634
01:47:16,190 --> 01:47:17,290
所以我问伊格纳西奥
So I asked Ignacio,

1635
01:47:17,290 --> 01:47:19,450
"那个狠角色是不是让超正作家找你
"Did the badass tell the stupid-fine writer chick

1636
01:47:19,450 --> 01:47:21,830
让你来找我  因为我和他要找的
to tell you to tell me, because I'm tight with Ant-Man,

1637
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:23,130
那个蚁人关系很好吗
"That he's looking for him?"

1638
01:47:23,740 --> 01:47:26,220
然后呢  他说什么
And? What'd he say?

1639
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:31,070
他说  没错
He said, "Yes."

00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,070
安东  我们走哪边
Anton, which way do we go?

77
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,010
谢谢  安东
Thanks, Anton!

78
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,850
看啊  蚂蚁打通进了科技设施
Look, the ants have burrowed into the tech facility.

79
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,890
不  激光
Oh no, lasers!

80
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,990
我好像碰到了激光
I think I got lased!

81
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,250
秘密宝库
The secret vault.

82
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,370
你带隐形眼镜来了吧
Tell me you brought the contact lens.

83
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,120
带了
Yup.

84
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,540
完美  对准那里
Perfect! Right there.

85
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,400
找到了  是微宝藏
There! It's the micro-treasure!

86
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,920
我的奖杯
My trophy?

87
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,160
看上去像宝藏
It looks like treasure.

88
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,450
对我来说是的
Oh, it is to me.

89
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,190
我想拿去做展示说明
I want to take it to show-and-tell.

90
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,400
那不行
Oh, no, you can't do that.

91
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,500
不行  它绝不能离开这栋房子
You can't. It never leaves the house.

92
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,600
它太重要了
It's too important.

93
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,020
这是你给我的最棒的生日礼物
This is the best birthday present you ever got me.

94
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,900
我觉得好感动
I'm so touched

95
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,790
你认为我是世界上最棒的奶奶
you think I'm the world's greatest grandma.

96
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,650
{\an8}世界上最棒的奶奶

97
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,650
他们只有这一个了
It was the only one they had.

98
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,500
让我好想给你织件毛衣
It makes me want to knit you a sweater.

99
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,900
不  是条子
Oh, no, the fuzz!

100
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,850
斯科特
Hey, Scotty...

101
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,300
我在看卡拉佩特安大楼的图纸
I was looking at the schematics for the Karapetyan buildings...

102
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,190
我觉得我们装了太多的监控摄像头
and I think we have way too many security cameras, don't we?

103
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,450
完全没有
No, no, not at all.

104
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,060
因为  摄像头真的好多
I mean, 'cause it's a lot of security cameras.

105
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,100
我知道他需要什么
I know what he needs.

106
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,820
我们公司的安保专家是谁啊
Who's the security expert in our business?

107
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,450
是你  但经营公司的是我
You are, but I'm running the company, right?

108
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,050
如果我们开价太高
And if we overquote him...

109
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,930
他会去别家的
he's gonna go somewhere else.

110
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,190
我们一定要让这只大鸟到手
I mean, we gotta land this bird.

111
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,400
他不会去别家的
He ain't goin' anywhere.

112
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,850
而且那句俗语是"大鱼到手"
And the expression is "Land this fish."

113
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,530
不  是"大鸟到手"
No, it's "Land the bird."

114
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,680
就像"飞机到站"嘛
Just like you land the plane.

115
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,600
你得"飞机到站"才能维系生意
You gotta land the plane to be in business.

116
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,050
我知道纠结这种事挺傻的
I know it's silly to get hung up on these kinds of things,

117
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,090
-但我就这样  -鱼怎么能到手
- but I do. - How am I gonna land a fish?

118
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,280
它又不能走  如果它游上岸
It can't walk. And if it swam up on shore

119
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,540
跟鹰打一架  谁会赢
and it battled a hawk, who's gonna win?

120
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,050
这件事我真被你说服了
You've really turned me around on this thing.

121
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,020
没事  我们会把卡拉佩特安拿到手的
It's okay. We're gonna land Karapetyan.

122
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,110
失陪了
Now, if you just excuse me

123
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
我正在跟女儿偷东西呢
I'm in the middle of trying to steal something with my daughter.

124
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,230
我去重查一遍
I'm gonna go recheck it.

125
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,750
去找跑路蚁
To the escape ant!

126
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,670
趁条子还没回来  我们赶紧跑
Let's bounce before the po-po come back!

127
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,300
条子  这些词你都哪学的
The po-po? How do you even know that?

128
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,080
飞吧  安托瓦内特  飞吧
Let's fly, Antoinette! Let's fly!

129
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,070
硬着陆
Crash landing!

130
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,790
真希望我们能真缩小
I wish we could shrink for real.

131
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,180
那是挺酷的
That is pretty cool.

132
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,300
我去办公室了  斯科特
I'm headed to the office, Scotty.

133
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,930
抱歉我之前抓狂了
And sorry about freaking out earlier, you know.

134
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,130
但我觉得我好多了
But I feel like I'm way better.

135
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,430
我的心绝对跳得太快了
My heart is definitely beating way too hard and stuff.

136
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,390
我的手也在抖
And my hands are shaking.

137
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,880
但应该跟这没关系的吧
But I think it's unrelated, you know?

138
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,150
肯定很棒的  路易斯
It's gonna be great, Luis!

139
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,150
你完全不用担心
You got nothing to worry about!

140
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,820
是啊  我是老大  我最棒了
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss. I'm the boss.

141
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,640
我最厉害  好好好
I'm the boss. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

142
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,870
爸爸
Daddy!

143
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,300
拜托  吴  我只剩三天了
Come on, Woo! I've got three days left.

144
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,630
我为什么要企图逃跑
Why would I try to escape?

145
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,290
抱歉  斯科特  规矩就是规矩
Sorry, Scott, but rules are rules.

146
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,150
你触发了边界警报  我们就搜屋
You trip the perimeter alarm, we search the place.

147
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,760
角角落落都得搜到
Keel to stern, soup to nuts.

148
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,610
谢谢
Thank you.

149
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,870
就是个意外  我的脚穿透了栅栏
It was an accident. My foot went through the fence.

150
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,400
我们的飞蚁硬着陆了
Our flying ant crashed.

151
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,630
你试试在不能出屋的情况下
Hey, you try and entertain a 10-year-old

152
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,010
逗一个10岁小孩
when you can't leave the house.

153
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,750
知道我多努力吗
You know the lengths that I've gone to?

154
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,850
近景魔术
Close-up magic.

155
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,040
我学的
I learned that.

156
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,870
你为什么就不能放过我爸爸
Why can't you just leave my daddy alone?

157
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,150
凯西
Oh, Cassie.

158
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,370
这一切一定让你觉得像是
This must all seem like a bunch of

159
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,790
令人困惑的大人的事吧
confusing grown-up stuff to you, huh?

160
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,530
这么想吧
Well, think of it this way.

161
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,330
你们学校有校规吧
Your school has rules, right?

162
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,700
比如  不能在墙上乱涂乱画
Like, you can't draw on the walls.

163
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,410
你爸爸去了德国
Well, your daddy went to Germany

164
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,700
跟美国队长在墙上乱涂乱画来着
and drew on the walls with Captain America.

165
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,960
这违反了《索科威亚协议》
And that was a violation of Article 16,

166
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,450
第16款第三条
Paragraph Three of the Sokovia Accords.

167
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,410
按照他与国土安全部
Now, as a part of his joint plea deal

168
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,600
和德国政府签订的联合认罪协议
with Homeland Security and the German government

169
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,520
他可以回到美国
he was allowed to return to the U.S

170
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,020
前提是他服两年的软禁刑期
provided he serve two years under house arrest

171
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,980
和三年的假释
followed by three years of probation.

172
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,000
且不得擅自行动或使用未获批设备
And avoid any unauthorized activities, technology

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,160
或接触任何曾经
or contact with any former associates

174
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,410
或正在违反前述协议或任何相关法规的
who were or currently are in violation of said Accords.

175
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,390
旧同伙
Or any related statutes.

176
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,480
懂了吗  亲爱的
Okay, sweetie?

177
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,100
你还真会带小孩
You're really great with kids.

178
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,030
谢谢  我兼职做青年牧师的
Thanks. I'm also a youth pastor.

179
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,870
总之  不是我包打听
Anyway, not to be a Johnny ask-a-lot

180
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,180
但你最近没联系过
but you haven't had any contact

181
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,190
汉克·皮姆和霍普·凡·戴恩吧
with Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne, have you?

182
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,760
-没有  -真的吗
- No. - You sure?

183
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,850
因为我们迟早会抓到他们
Because it's only a matter of time before we get 'em.

184
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,550
那是他们的设备  所以他们也违反了协议
It was their tech, so they violated the Accords, too.

185
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,700
跟他们有联系是违反你的认罪协议的
And associating with them breaks your deal.

186
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,090
不用我提醒你
And, uh, I don't need to remind you

187
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,310
若对认罪协议有丝毫违反
that any violation of your agreement

188
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,580
就是至少20年的监狱刑期
means 20 years in prison. Minimum.

189
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,010
我好久没跟汉克和霍普联系过了
I haven't talked to Hank or Hope in forever.

190
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,290
他们恨死他了
They hate his guts.

191
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,410
谢谢  小花生
Thanks, peanut.

192
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,290
你怎么做到的  斯科特
How'd you do it, Scott?

193
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,690
做什么
Do what?

194
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,440
纸牌戏法
The card trick.

195
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,570
不是吧
Seriously?

196
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,880
天呐
Oh, my God!

197
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,910
你们不能高兴了就跑来
You people can't just show up here whenever you want

198
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,180
然后搜查这里
and search the place.

199
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,270
其实  他们可以的
Actually, they can.

200
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,200
你需要搜查令
You need a warrant.

201
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,310
其实  他们不需要
Actually, they don't.

202
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,210
真的吗
Really?

203
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,430
带足球鞋了吗
Did you pack your soccer shoes?

204
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,880
-嗯  -好
- Yeah. - All right.

205
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,730
下次我再见你  就是在外面了
Next time I see you will be on the outside.

206
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,600
好
All right.

207
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,830
我也要抱抱
Get on the inside of this.

208
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,080
三天了  真的
Hey, three days. Seriously...

209
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,500
-为你骄傲  哥们  -谢谢
- I'm proud of you, bud. - Thank you.

210
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,740
知道吗  再来一个
You know what? Give me another one.

211
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,340
我也是  天呐  自由
Me too! Gosh! Freedom!

212
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,030
新生意  我觉得你前途无量
New business! I am sensing greatness.

213
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,700
我这周末很开心  爸爸
I had a fun weekend, Daddy.

214
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,850
我也是  小花生  等下周末的
Me too, peanut. But just wait till next weekend.

215
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,260
等我能出屋了  我们要出去疯玩
Once I'm outta here, you and I are gonna go paint this town red.

216
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,060
我们要吃一大堆冰淇淋  然后吐个不停
We'll have so much ice cream, we'll never stop puking.

217
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,650
你越来越厉害了
You're gettin' good at that.

218
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,290
怎么做到的
How'd you do that?

219
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,250
-再见  爸爸  -再见
- Bye, Daddy. - Bye.

220
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,780
-再见  -再见
- Bye. - Bye.

221
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,200
三天
Three days.

222
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,100
轻松
Easy-peasy.

223
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,320
{\an8}线上近景魔术大学

224
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,760
打指响  让他们看这边
Snap your fingers. That gets them to look over there.

225
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,570
这叫做误导
And that is misdirection.

226
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,270
我们曾梦想
We had a dream

227
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,480
会一起去旅行
We'd go travelin' together

228
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,970
我们散播一点爱意  然后继续向前
We'd spread a little lovin' then we'd keep movin' on

229
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,710
{\an8}星运里的错

230
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,300
{\an8}卡拉佩特安公寓楼

231
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,110
轻松
Easy-peasy.

232
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,370
你在哪
Where are you?

233
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,910
你所知的一切
Everything that you know...

234
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,260
迷失在
Lost...

235
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,050
量子域里
in the quantum realm.

236
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,210
什么
What?

237
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,780
我要找到你  小糖豆
I'm gonna find you, Jellybean.

238
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,520
我找到你了
I found you!

239
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,380
你总能找到我  妈妈
You always find me, Mommy.

240
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,650
怎么回事
What the hell?

241
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,530
汉克  好久没联系了
Hank! It's been a while.

242
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,230
我都不知道这是否还是你的号码
I don't even know if this is your number anymore.

243
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,620
我可能是你最不想联系的人了
And I'm probably the last person you wanna hear from. But

244
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,760
但我刚做了个特奇怪的梦
I just had a really weird dream.

245
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,380
我知道这听上去不像是什么急事
And I know that doesn't sound like an emergency or anything...

246
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,070
但感觉特别真实
but it just felt very real.

247
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,750
我又回到了量子域
I was back in the quantum realm...

248
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,880
我觉得我看到了你妻子
and I think I saw your wife.

249
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,540
然后我变成你妻子了
And then I was your wife.

250
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,930
不是什么奇怪的意思
I mean, not in a weird way or anything.

251
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,030
其实  我这么说出来
You know, hearing this out loud,

252
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,720
我开始觉得  这事真不急
I'm thinking, uh, it's not an emergency.

253
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,120
抱歉打扰你了
I'm sorry to bother you.

254
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,730
我对很多事都感到抱歉
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

255
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,780
就是说  我手指甲上的一颗小原子
That means, one tiny atom in my fingernail

256
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,930
-就可能...  -可能是个
- could be... - Could be one, little,

257
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,900
小宇宙
tiny universe.

258
00:13:59,190 --> 00:13:59,900
霍普
Hope?

259
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,620
这又是梦吗
Is this another dream?

260
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,580
你觉得那是梦吗
Do you think it was a dream

261
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,410
还是说你真有可能在那里看到了我妈妈
or is it possible that you really saw my mom down there?

262
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,410
我不确定
I'm not sure.

263
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,320
我不能在这儿
I can't be here!

264
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,370
我不能在这儿  我在服软禁刑期
I can't be here! I'm under house arrest!

265
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,300
系统运行时是打不开的  斯科特
They won't open while the system's engaged, Scott.

266
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,570
你得带我回家  他们随时可能会上门
You have to take me home. They could show up any second!

267
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,390
放松  就你的保姆警察所知
Relax. As far as your nanny cops know,

268
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,550
你还在家呢
you're still at home.

269
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,280
斯科特
Scotty?

270
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,830
他已被编程好复制你的日常活动
He's programmed to replicate your daily routine.

271
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,970
九小时睡觉
Nine hours in bed.

272
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,330
五小时看电视
Five hours in front of the TV.

273
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,730
两小时泡在厕所  不管是为啥
Two hours in the bathroom, whatever that's about.

274
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,400
这根本不准确
That's totally inaccurate.

275
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,110
你怎么会知道我的日常活动
And how do you know about my daily routine?

276
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,020
你在监视我吗
Are you spying on me?

277
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,920
我们注意一切安全隐患
We keep tabs on all security threats, all right?

278
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,980
而目前为止  你是最大的一个
And so far the biggest one we've had is you.

279
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,560
德国的事我很抱歉  是他们跑来找我
I'm sorry about Germany. They just showed up.

280
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,090
还说事关国家安全
They said it was a matter of national security.

281
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,110
美队需要帮助  所以...
That Cap needed help, so...

282
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,900
美队
Cap?

283
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,240
...国队长  美国队长  美队
Tain America. Captain. Cap.

284
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,400
我们就这么喊他
It's what we call him.

285
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,700
朋友之间
If you're a friend.

286
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,990
我倒不是说我算是朋友...算是吧
I'm not saying I'm a friend of... A little,

287
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,680
我认识他  他人挺好  不说了
I know him. He's nice. Whatever.

288
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,600
对不起  好吗  我没想到我会被抓
I'm sorry! All right? I didn't think I'd get caught.

289
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,270
你没想的事多了
You didn't think about a lot of things.

290
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,500
汉克怎么样
How's Hank?

291
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,480
我们还在逃跑
We're still running.

292
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,120
房子没了  我们的自由也没了
The house is gone, so is our freedom.

293
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,300
你觉得他会怎么样
How do you think he is?

294
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,550
对不起  我知道你生我气
I'm sorry. I know you're mad.

295
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,120
我要的不是道歉  斯科特
I'm not looking for an apology, Scott.

296
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,470
我之所以还跟你说话
The only reason why we're even talking

297
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,440
是因为我们需要你脑子里的东西
is because we need what's in your head.

298
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,320
这是你们住的地方吗
Is this where you're living?

299
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,790
如果你们需要帮助或钱  或许我可以...
If you need help or money or something, maybe I can...

300
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,730
不用
We're fine.

301
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,860
汉克  听着  我只想...
Hank. Look, I just wanna...

302
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,830
省省吧
Save it!

303
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,090
-可以开始了吗  -嗯
- Can we start? - Yeah.

304
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,690
你在家放松的时候
So, while you were relaxing at home

305
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,180
我们建了这个
we were building this.

306
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,170
是个隧道  通往量子域
It's a tunnel. To the quantum realm.

307
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,150
去找我妈妈
To my mom.

308
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,820
我们认为她可能还在那里
We think she might still be down there.

309
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,970
但我们不知道在哪
We just don't know where.

310
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,770
什么
What?

311
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,370
如果我们能定位出我妈的位置
If we can pinpoint my mom's location...

312
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,170
那我就能开驾驶舱去救她
then the pod can take me down to get her.

313
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,110
你们建造了这一切
You built all this

314
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,200
却都不能确定她是不是还活着吗
and you don't even know if she's alive?

315
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,260
这叫假设
It's called a hypothesis.

316
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,980
昨晚我们第一次启动了隧道
Last night, we powered up the tunnel for the first time.

317
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,100
但过载  于是关停了
It was overloaded and it shut down.

318
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,750
但就在那一瞬间
But for a split second,

319
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,430
通往量子域的大门被打开了
the doorway to the quantum realm was opened.

320
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:21,880
然后呢
And?

321
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,380
五分钟后  你打了来  说起了我妈妈
And five minutes later, you called, talking about Mom.

322
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,860
我们认为你去那下面时
We think when you were down there,

323
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,660
可能跟她发生了纠缠
you may have entangled with her.

324
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,550
汉克  我绝不会那么做的
Hank, I would never do that.

325
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,890
我是尊重你的
I respect you too much.

326
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,400
量子纠缠  斯科特
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

327
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,190
我们认为她可能
We think she might have

328
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,230
在你脑袋里放了信息
put some kind of a message in your head.

329
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,830
希望是个位置信息
Hopefully, a location.

330
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,780
打开隧道时  信息被触发了
And opening the tunnel triggered it.

331
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,540
你妈妈在我脑袋里留了信息
Your mom put a message in my head?

332
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,340
拜托  这疯了
Come on. That's insane.

333
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,490
不  斯科特
No, Scott.

334
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,530
疯狂
Insane

335
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,480
是不告诉我们就跑去德国跟复仇者联盟打架
is going to Germany without telling us, and fighting the Avengers.

336
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,910
告诉我  关于你偷的战衣  你没撒谎
Just tell me you weren't lying about the suit you took.

337
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,560
告诉我你确实销毁了它
Tell me you really destroyed it.

338
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,980
是的  我销毁了它  我发誓
I did, I destroyed it, I swear.

339
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,450
我真不敢相信你销毁了我的战衣
I can't believe you destroyed my suit!

340
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,750
那可是我的毕生心血
That was my life's work!

341
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,030
我还能怎么办
What was I supposed to do?

342
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,740
你就不该偷走我的战衣
You were supposed to not take my suit!

343
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,110
对不起  汉克
I'm sorry, Hank!

344
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,470
对不起我偷走了战衣
I'm sorry I took the suit.

345
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,410
对不起我昨晚打了电话
I'm sorry that I called last night.

346
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,090
我不记得在下面见过珍妮特
I don't remember seeing Janet down there.

347
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,360
我也希望我见过
I wish that I did.

348
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,170
我就是梦到了她
I just had a dream about her

349
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,130
跟一个小姑娘玩捉迷藏
playing hide-and-seek with a little girl.

350
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,230
什么
What?

351
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,580
我做了个梦
I had a dream.

352
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,470
她在跟个小姑娘玩捉迷藏
She was playing hide-and-seek with a little girl.

353
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,340
凯西和我以前常玩的
Cassie and I do it all the time.

354
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,660
没什么意义
Doesn't mean anything.

355
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,850
但梦里的是凯西吗
But was it Cassie in the dream?

356
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:35,890
不是
No.

357
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,520
她藏在了哪里
Where was she hiding?

358
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,910
-什么  -那个小姑娘
- What? - The little girl.

359
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,060
她藏在了哪里  大衣柜吗
Where was she hiding? Was it in a wardrobe?

360
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,310
不是  是个很大的柜子
No, it was in a tall dresser.

361
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,610
就是大衣柜咯
You mean a wardrobe.

362
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,810
是这么叫的吗
Is that what that's called?

363
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,490
什么颜色的
What color was it?

364
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,160
红的
Red.

365
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,060
上面有小马吗
Were there horses on it?

366
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,490
天呐
Oh, boy.

367
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,890
我们玩时  我每次都藏在那里
It's where I hid every time that we played.

368
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,280
听上去
It doesn't sound like

369
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,500
你没太理解这游戏的要义
you really got the gist of the game.

370
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,540
她还活着
She's alive.

371
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,940
我就知道
I knew it.

372
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,460
我就知道
I knew it!

373
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,380
我们得拿到那个部件
We need to get that part.

374
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,290
好
Okay.

375
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,880
我们越早让隧道正常运作
The sooner we get the tunnel working...

376
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,710
就能越早从他脑袋里提取到信息
the sooner we can get this message out of his head.

377
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,700
伯奇拿到了吗
Does Burch have it?

378
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,310
-是的  我们走  -什么部件
- Yeah. Let's go. - What part?

379
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,810
伯奇是谁  等等  什么情况啊
Who's Burch? Wait. What's happening?

380
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,780
我们需要一个部件
We need a component

381
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,900
来防止隧道再次过载
to stop the tunnel from overloading again.

382
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,320
我帮你拿了衣服  你最好换一下
I grabbed your clothes. You might want to change.

383
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,310
听着  我也想帮你们
Look, I'd really like to help you...

384
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,880
但如果他们来给我摘脚环时我不在家
but if I'm not at home when they come to take off my ankle monitor

385
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,210
那我就要蹲一辈子了
then I'm going away forever.

386
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,410
等我们拿到了部件  启动了隧道
Once we get the component and power up the tunnel

387
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,480
就能拿到信息  你午饭前就能回到家
we'll get the message, and have you home by lunch.

388
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,940
我们得快点  纠缠不会维持太久
We have to hurry. The entanglement won't last.

389
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,140
你欠我们的
You owe us.

390
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,680
好吧  我能不能进去等
All right, fine. But can I just wait inside?

391
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,370
因为我不该在外面的
Because I'm not supposed to be out here.

392
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,340
走吧
Let's go.

393
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,650
-没问题吧  -嗯
- We good? - Yeah.

394
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,580
我就回来
I'll be right back.

395
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,430
-我能吃个吗  -不能
- Can I have one of these? - No.

396
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,470
苏珊  欢迎来到好餐厅
Susan! Welcome to Oui!

397
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,130
桑尼
Sonny!

398
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,530
"好"是法语"是"的意思
Oui is French for "Yes."

399
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,720
立意就是  是从农场直接上餐桌的本地好料
As in "Yes" to farm-to-table, "Yes" to locally sourced...

400
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,110
是把生态摆在利益之前的好策略
and "Yes" to planet before profit.

401
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,010
那希望"你是否拿到了
Well, let's hope it also means "Yes"

402
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,930
我订购的部件"的答案也是"是"
to "Do you have the component I ordered?"

403
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,520
我一向喜欢你的幽默感  苏珊
You know, I have always loved your sense of humor, Susan.

404
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:20,550
请坐
Have a seat.

405
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,700
不用了  谢谢
No, I'm good. Thank you.

406
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,850
这人是谁
Who is this guy?

407
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,490
桑尼·伯奇  黑市科技走私贩
Sonny Burch. He traffics in black market technology.

408
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,170
他为我们取得了建造隧道需要的材料
He's been getting us what we need to build the tunnel.

409
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,370
能给我一个...
Could I just have one...

410
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,600
不能
No.

411
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,310
我在联调局有个特别的朋友
You know, I have a special friend at the FBI.

412
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,900
我说"特别"是因为
And I say "Special" because,

413
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,640
他会告诉我些我原本不知道的事
well, he tells me things that I didn't previously know.

414
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,470
比如说
For example...

415
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,090
你名字不叫苏珊
your name isn't Susan.

416
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,220
而是霍普·凡·戴恩
It's Hope Van Dyne.

417
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,670
而你背后的同伙是你父亲  汉克·皮姆
And your unseen associate, that's your father, Hank Pym.

418
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,940
-这可不妙  汉克  -还用你说
- That's not good, Hank. - No shit.

419
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,240
你想要什么
What do you want?

420
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,980
关系是建立在信任上的  霍普
Relationships are built on trust, Hope.

421
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,840
我希望我们的关系有坚实的基础
And I want our relationship to have a strong foundation.

422
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,050
我们的关系
Our relationship?

423
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,640
我的市场在变化  霍普
My business landscape has been shifting, Hope.

424
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,090
神盾局和九头蛇都不存在了
Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA don't even exist anymore...

425
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,330
但汉克·皮姆呢
but now, Hank Pym...

426
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,500
汉克·皮姆是个好机会
Hank Pym is a real opportunity.

427
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,630
你到底想说什么
Do you have a point?

428
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,640
你以为我不知道
Oh, you think that I don't know

429
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,530
你要这些是在建造什么吗
what you've been building with all this?

430
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,510
量子科技
Quantum technology.

431
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,680
什么纳米科技啊  人工智能啊
Now, you can forget nanotech, forget AI,

432
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,920
加密货币都过时了
forget cryptocurrency.

433
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,790
量子科技才是未来
Quantum energy is the future.

434
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,690
是下一阵淘金热
It's the next gold rush.

435
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,410
是吗
Is that so?

436
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,640
我要加入  霍普
I want in, Hope.

437
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,960
所以  出于好意  我已经擅自
So, as a gesture of good will, I have taken the liberty

438
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,330
为你的实验室安排了买家
of arranging some buyers for your lab.

439
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,800
起价
Starting bid

440
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,610
是十亿美金
one billion dollars.

441
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,390
谢谢  桑尼  真的
Thank you, Sonny, really.

442
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,540
但我父亲和我有件
But my father and I have something

443
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,370
比成立公司要更紧急的事
slightly more pressing than starting a business.

444
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,360
所以我还是按说好的拿走部件
So I'll just take the component as arranged.

445
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,860
我的买家不接受拒绝
My buyers don't take no for an answer.

446
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,220
所以  我们要么一起做生意
So, we are either in business together

447
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,470
要么就不做生意了
or we aren't in business together.

448
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,250
那就不做吧
Then I guess we aren't.

449
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,830
你可以走
You can go.

450
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,050
但你的钱恐怕得留下
But I'm afraid your money's gonna have to remain.

451
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,740
就当是赔偿我受伤的感情
Let's call it compensation for my injured feelings.

452
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,820
听着  桑尼
Listen, Sonny.

453
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,660
如果你痛快把部件给我
This is gonna be so much easier on everybody

454
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,390
对大家都会简单得多
if you just give me that component.

455
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,440
亲爱的  你唯一可以拿走的
Darlin', the only thing you're takin' from here...

456
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,900
就是我的心  但它会渐渐愈合的
is my heart, but it will mend in time.

457
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,830
好吧
Okay.

458
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,320
现在怎么办
So, now what?

459
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,720
等着瞧
You'll see.

460
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,070
她说她和她爸有什么要紧事
She said her and her daddy had something pressing.

461
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,040
我要知道是什么事
I want to know what it is

462
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,470
因为如果他们没在跟我们合作
because if they're not working with us

463
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,720
就肯定在跟别人合作
they're working with somebody.

464
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,260
去查明  我要知道名字
So find out. I want some names...

465
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,710
等等  你给她加了翅膀
Hold on, you gave her wings?

466
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,750
抓到她
Get her.

467
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,100
别打碎我的世纪之交大吊灯
Not my turn-of-the-century chandelier!

468
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,180
别开枪了  住手
Stop firing! Stop!

469
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,330
好吧  拿上这个  快走
All right, take this. Go. Go, go, go!

470
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:38,970
快走
Go!

471
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,680
翅膀还有爆能枪
Wings and blasters.

472
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,910
看来我那时候这技术还没开发好咯
So I take it you didn't have that tech available for me.

473
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,040
开发好了
No, I did.

474
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,870
很高兴跟你做生意  桑尼
It was a pleasure doing business with you, Sonny.

475
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,840
我们的事还没完呢  霍普
Oh, our business isn't finished yet, Hope.

476
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,760
我可以向你保证
I can assure you of that!

477
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,720
那是什么
What in the hell is that?

478
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,020
爸爸  你看到了吗
Dad, are you seeing this?

479
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,600
霍普  快跑
Hope, get out of there!

480
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,730
-我得做点什么  -等等
- I gotta do something. - Wait!

481
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,250
还没完成
It is still a work in progress.

482
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,210
那一踢是你教我的  记得吗
You taught me that kick. Remember?

483
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,440
嗯  姿势很棒
Yeah, great form.

484
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,370
想当年啊  我们是怎么了
Those were the days. Whatever happened to us?

485
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,040
不是时候  斯科特
Not the time, Scott.

486
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,500
该死  它哪去了
Damn it, where'd it go?

487
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,030
我跟丢了
I've lost it.

488
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,550
蚂蚁摄像头上什么都看不到
I'm not seeing anything on the ant cams.

489
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,450
去看看...
Try looking...

490
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,380
爸爸
Dad?

491
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,470
把那个给我
Give me that.

492
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,540
快点
Now.

493
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,440
-你没事吧  -有事
- Are you okay? - No!

494
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,700
他拿了实验室
He got the lab.

495
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,930
-不  -快走
- No. - Come on!

496
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,120
那是什么
What was that?

497
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,610
我不知道
I don't know.

498
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,490
但我们得找个地方重新部署
But we need to find somewhere to regroup

499
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,320
并查明实验室在哪
and figure out where the lab is.

500
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,400
现在去哪
So, where to now?

501
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,210
我家吧
How about my house?

502
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,820
我反正也该在那儿的
I'm supposed to be there anyway,

503
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,680
吴随时都可能到
and Woo could walk in any second.

504
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,590
所以我们绝不能去你家
Exactly why we're not going to your house.

505
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,790
那你家呢
What about your house?

506
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:56,730
抱歉
Sorry.

507
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,450
那我只能想到一个地方了
Well, there is one place I can think of.

508
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,470
不
No.

509
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,210

00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,840
您再次在危难时刻
once again, in your hour of need

515
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,440
找到了我们
that you would turn to us, you know?

516
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,070
我是没想到
Not me.

517
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:20,840
自便
Help yourself.

518
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,600
干吗买这么高档的点心
What's up with the fancy pastry?

519
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,920
我们得控制食物预算
We gotta keep the food budget down.

520
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,980
那我们早餐该吃什么
Well, what are we supposed to have for breakfast?

521
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,250
燕麦片
The oatmeal packets.

522
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,720
燕麦片
Oatmeal packets.

523
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,430
-这是侮辱  -怎么是侮辱了
- It's insult. - Why is it an insult?

524
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,520
因为那味道像沙子
Because it tastes like sand.

525
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,150
知道为什么吗  因为那是有机食品
You know why? 'Cause it's organic.

526
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,520
不是有机食品  是沙子
It's not organic, it's sand.

527
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,640
那可是一天最重要的一餐
It's the most important meal of the day.

528
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,800
你可以随意发挥嘛
You know what, you can get creative with it.

干什么啊
Come on, man.

We got bigger fish to fry.

535
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,670
那是我的桌子吗
Is that my desk?

536
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,980
-是的  -什么
- Yeah. - What?

537
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,370
为什么我的桌子那么小
Why do I have such a small desk?

538
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,640
{\an8}斯科特

539
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,920
因为我们选桌子时你又不在
Because you weren't there when we were choosing desks.

540
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,140
打瞌睡  没得选
You snooze, you lose.

541
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,310
我在被软禁啊
Well, I was under house arrest.

542
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:54,860
是啊
Yeah.

543
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,250
知道吗  这都算不上是桌子
You know what, this isn't even a desk.

544
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,250
这是垃圾
This is garbage.

545
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,930
你们是在外面的垃圾里找来的
You found this outside amongst garbage.

546
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,210
是在旧物义卖上淘来的
I got it at a rummage sale.

547
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,920
你就偏在我的桌子上省钱
So, you save money on my desk?

548
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,650
行了
Guys.

549
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,240
霍普  拜托  我们得集中精神
Hope, please, we need to focus, all right?

550
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,640
我们得赶紧找到那个实验室  天呐
We gotta find that lab already. Jeez.

551
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,120
知道吗  我听说了你的遭遇
Oh, you know what? I heard stories, like what happened to you.

552
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,560
说有个吓人的家伙  能钻墙
This crazy, creepy cat, who walks through walls and stuff.

553
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,250
像个幽灵
Like a ghost.

554
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,990
像雅加婆婆
Like Baba Yaga.

555
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,910
雅加婆婆  女巫
Baba Yaga, the witch.

556
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,160
他们给小孩子讲故事吓唬他们
They tell stories to children to frighten them.

557
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,930
你知道雅加婆婆吗
You know Baba Yaga?

558
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,640
不管是谁偷的
Whoever stole it...

559
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,050
我们得找到它
we need to find it.

560
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,620
那样的人是找不到的  得等他们找你
Oh, you don't find someone like that. They find you.

561
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,230
就像雅加婆婆
Like Baba Yaga.

562
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,410
皮姆博士  你是我认识的最聪明的天才
Dr. Pym, you're the smartest genius I know.

563
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,820
你没有在实验室上安装寻回系统吗
Didn't you put some kind of LoJack on your lab?

564
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,800
因为如果你没有
Because if you didn't,

565
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,110
我们这里有很多价钱公道的选择
we have a variety of affordable options.

566
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,130
我当然安装了  路易斯
Of course I did, Luis.

567
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,710
系统被解除了
It was disabled.

568
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,590
偷走实验室的人非常在行
Whoever stole the lab knew exactly what they were doing.

569
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,490
那人看上去好像还在变相
They also looked like they were phasing.

570
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,430
变相
Phasing?

571
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,570
量子变相
Quantum phasing.

572
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,900
就是物体在物质的各状态间变化
When an object moves through different states of matter.

573
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,720
是啊  我想的也是那个
Oh, yeah, that's what I was thinking.

574
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,050
实验室释放辐射
The lab emits radiation.

575
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,770
我们可以改造一台量子光谱仪追踪它吗
Can we modify a quantum spectrometer and track it?

576
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,920
那是可行的  但我的设备都在实验室里
That could work, yes, but all my equipment is in the lab.

577
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,600
还有哪里有那样的设备
Where else can we find that equipment?

578
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,210
是有那么个人
Well, there is one person.

579
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,740
比尔·福斯特
Bill Foster.

580
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,430
好啊
Great!

581
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,050
那是谁
Who's Bill Foster?

582
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,940
他是我爸爸的一个老同事  神盾局的
He's an old colleague of my dad's, from S.H.I.E.L.D.

583
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,350
他们多年前就闹崩了
They had a falling out years ago.

584
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,580
你似乎经常跟人闹崩
You seem to have a lot of falling outs with people.

585
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,490
可能只是浪费时间
It's probably just a waste of time.

586
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,840
我光是在这里可就是赌上了一切
I'm risking everything by being here.

587
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,180
你不觉得我们该去问问吗
Don't you think we should check?

588
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,310
我们得查明是谁偷走了实验室
We need to find out who took the lab.

589
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,000
伙计们  这样暴露在外可不太好
Guys, it's not a good idea to be out in the open like this.

590
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,040
放松  没人会认出我们的
Relax, no one's gonna recognize us.

591
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,490
怎么  就因为帽子和墨镜吗
What, because of hats and sunglasses?

592
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,200
这不叫伪装  汉克
That's not a disguise, Hank.

593
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,480
我们只是像看棒球赛的自己
We look like ourselves at a baseball game.

594
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,540
在独立系统中
In an isolated system...

595
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:45,290
粒子以稳定相关系共存
particles co-exist in a stable phase relationship.

596
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,470
如果系统受到干扰
If the system is interfered with,

597
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,840
稳定就会变成混乱
that stability becomes chaos.

598
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,390
不可预测
Unpredictable.

599
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,170
危险  美妙
Dangerous. Beautiful.

600
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,910
完全独立的量子系统
Isolated completely, a quantum system

601
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,560
将退回到物质的不同状态
would revert back to separate states of matter...

602
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,370
每一个都与其环境的独特状态纠缠
each entangled with a distinct state of its environment.

603
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,650
也就是说
In other words,

604
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,860
这一物体将同时与多个平行现实
the object in question would be both in and out of phase

605
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,330
同相和异相
with multiple parallel realities.

606
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,970
说到跟现实不同步
Speaking of being out of phase with reality.

607
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,320
我注意到你们之中
I am noticing an unusually high number

608
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,760
有异常多的朦胧目光
of glazed eyes out there among you.

609
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,810
我们就提前几分钟结束吧
So, why don't we call it a few minutes early?

610
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,040
今天就到这儿吧
That'll be enough for today.

611
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,050
谢谢  女士们先生们  你们可以走了
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, you may go.

612
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,130
真是难以置信  你与珍妮特相连
It's incredible. You're linked to Janet.

613
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,950
这是你脑中波斯纳分子的各量子态
It's quantum entanglement between the quantum states of

614
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,840
之间的量子纠缠
Posner molecules in your brains.

615
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,390
嗯  我也那么想的
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

616
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,850
你们是把"量子"一词加在每句话之前吗
Do you guys just put the word "quantum" in front of everything?

617
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,580
博士  我们得找到我们的实验室
Doctor, we need to find our lab.

618
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,600
霍普  我也想帮你
Hope, I'd love to help you...

619
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,440
但我并没有你说的那样的设备
but I don't have anything like the equipment you're describing.

620
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,960
我就说这是浪费时间  我们走吧
I told you this is a waste of time. Come on, let's go.

621
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,410
别瞧不起我  汉克
Don't condescend, Hank.

622
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,360
是你在躲避联调局的追捕
You're the one who's on the run from the FBI.

623
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,320
就因为你非得把自己放大到
All because you had to grow to a size

624
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,360
与你的自大相配的尺寸
that finally fit your ego.

625
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,550
德国那个不是我  是这个白痴
That wasn't me in Germany. It was this idiot.

626
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:06,980
真的
Really?

627
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,160
变那么大肯定很累吧
Going that big, it must've been exhausting.

628
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,890
我之后整整睡了三天  你都无法想象
I slept for three days straight. You have no idea.

629
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,020
我能想象
Actually, I do.

630
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,830
想当年  我曾跟汉克搭档搞过一个项目
Back in the day, I was Hank's partner on a project called

631
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,660
歌利亚[巨人]
Goliath.

632
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,380
等等  你是我的搭档吗
Excuse me? You were my partner?

633
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,690
唯一比变那么大还累的
The only thing more tiring than going that big

634
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,610
就是忍受汉克的臭脾气
is putting up with Hank's bullshit.

635
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,580
是啊
Right...

636
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,630
我不知道
I don't know.

637
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,400
你变得多大
How big did you get?

638
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,780
最高纪录是21英尺
My record? 21 feet.

639
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,180
-不赖啊  -你呢
- Not bad. - You?

640
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,680
算了
I don't...

641
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,110
不  真的  我很好奇
No, really, I'm curious.

642
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,730
65英尺  是啊
65 feet. Yeah.

643
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:39,980
-好大啊  -65英尺
- Huge. - 65.

644
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,500
如果你们俩比够大小了
If you two are finished comparing sizes...

645
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,520
我们得想办法追踪实验室
we need to figure out a way to track down the lab.

646
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,600
伟大的汉克·皮姆还没想到办法吗
And the great Hank Pym hasn't figured that one out yet?

647
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,570
奇怪啊
Strange.

648
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,030
你想当年可是无所不知
You had all the answers back in the day.

649
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,590
所以我才离开了项目
That's why I left the project.

650
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,570
离开吗
Left?

651
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,140
-是我炒了你  -我最正确的决定
- I fired you. - Best decision I ever made.

652
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,360
汉克是个糟糕的搭档  脾气暴躁
Hank was a terrible partner. Temperamental...

653
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,190
固执  没耐心
stubborn, impatient.

654
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,660
他迟早会把所有人都推开
Sooner or later, he just pushed everyone away.

655
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,970
只是那些庸才
Just the mediocrities.

656
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,590
珍妮特是唯一受得了他
Janet was the only one who could endure him

657
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,790
并选择留下来的
and chose to stick it out.

658
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,630
小心点  比尔
Watch it, Bill.

659
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,420
但她为此付出了代价  是吧
She paid the price, though, didn't she?

660
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,430
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch.

661
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,730
我不是来这儿听你俩吵嘴的
I didn't come here to listen to you two squabble.

662
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,700
我想救我妈妈
I'm trying to save my mother.

663
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,730
你说是哪个办公室
Now, which office would you say?

664
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:20,830
是吴
Oh, it's Woo.

665
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,860
肯定是有人看见了我
Someone must have seen me.

666
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,140
放松  如果是因为你
Relax. If this is about you,

667
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,000
他们早该赶到你家了
they'd be in your house by now.

668
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,320
你是15岁小孩吗
What are you, 15?

669
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,620
快点  我们得马上走了
Come on. We gotta go right now.

670
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,810
等等  你们或许能制造个临时追踪器
Wait. You might be able to improvise that tracker...

671
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,190
只需要修改你调节器的衍射组件
if you modify the diffraction units on one of your regulators.

672
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,540
-这可行  -我都不知道那是什么意思
- That could work. - I don't know what that means.

673
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,850
谢谢  谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

674
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,010
但是  博士
But, Doctor,

675
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,370
校警说他们发现了皮姆和凡·戴恩
campus police says they ID'd both Pym and Van Dyne.

676
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,630
我不知道该怎么说  探员
I don't know what to tell you, Agent.

677
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,830
我都30年没跟汉克说过话了
I haven't talked to Hank in 30 years.

678
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,480
我向你保证
I can assure you

679
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,160
我是他最不会想见的人了
I'm the last person he would want to visit.

680
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,340
得了  你指望我们...
Oh, come on, you expect us to...

681
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:05,860
为什么
Why is that?

682
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:09,010
简单  我们恨死彼此了
Simple. We hate each other's guts.

683
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,660
我是糟糕的搭档
So I'm a terrible partner?

684
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:14,090
福斯特  在他平庸的职业生涯中
Foster, he hasn't had one good idea

685
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,260
就没想出过一个好点子
in his unremarkable career.

686
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,310
但他关于衍射器的点子可行  是吧
But his idea about the diffractors could work, right?

687
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,350
好吧  一个好点子
Fine, one decent idea.

688
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,350
但我升级战衣时
Except, I eliminated the diffractors

689
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,170
去掉了衍射器
when I upgraded the suits.

690
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,070
所以  如果我们有旧战衣
So, if we had an old suit,

691
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,430
我们或许就能追踪到实验室了
we might be able to track down the lab?

692
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,930
是的  但我们没有
Yes, but we don't.

693
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,150
-如果我们有呢  -你什么意思
- What if we did? - What do you mean?

694
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,050
我是说...
I mean...

695
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:40,610
人生很奇妙
life's funny.

696
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,320
天呐  你没销毁战衣
Oh, my God. You didn't destroy the suit.

697
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:43,950
什么
What?

698
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,910
那是你毕生的心血  汉克
Well, it was your life's work, Hank.

699
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,790
我不能销毁它
I couldn't destroy that.

700
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:49,730
我自首之前
Before I turned myself in,

701
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,670
我把它缩小然后邮给了路易斯
I shrunk it down and mailed it to Luis.

702
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,130
你把我的战衣邮寄了出去
You sent my suit through the mail?

703
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,610
邮政服务是非常可靠的
Hey, the postal service is very reliable.

704
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:59,860
现在有追踪码了  像快递服务一样
You know, they do tracking numbers now. Like UPS.

705
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:00,830
它在哪
Where is it?

706
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,530
在一个非常安全的地方  别担心
It's in a very safe place, all right? Don't worry.

707
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:06,310
奖杯吗  不在了
What, the trophy? No, it's not here.

708
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,910
什么叫不在了  还能在哪
What do you mean it's not there? Where could it be?

709
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,430
我到处看了  不在
I looked everywhere. It's not here.

710
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,070
别动那盆花
Hey, get away from the plant.

711
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,050
但我跟凯西玩过后  我放回...
But I put it back after Cassie and I...

712
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,080
展示说明
Show-and-tell.

713
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,530
斯科特
Scotty?

714
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,100
不  别
No, stop!

715
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:22,510
好消息是  我知道它在哪
Well, the good news is I know where it is.

716
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,510
{\an8}布鲁克蒙特小学

717
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,190
不是说回到学校时
Whenever you go back to school

718
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,340
会觉得一切都变小了吗
isn't everything supposed to look so much smaller?

719
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,820
这地方看上去好大
This place seems huge.

720
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,130
怎么了
What is it?

721
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,360
是新调节器
It's the new regulator.

722
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,020
汉克  这件战衣怎么回事
Hank, what's going on with this suit?

723
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,110
到底是多"还没完成"
How much of a work in progress is this?

724
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,630
不不不
No, no, no.

725
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,720
你笑什么  拜托  你能不能
What are you, laughing? Please, could you just...

726
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,890
好啦
Okay, okay.

727
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,110
怎么样
What do you see?

728
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,250
尺寸线圈故障了
The sizing coils are malfunctioning.

729
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,140
让我...
Just let me...

730
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,630
-抱歉  -没事的
- Sorry. - It's all right.

731
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:16,950
好吧
Okay.

732
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:18,550
好了
All right.

733
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,940
现在试试
Try that.

734
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,190
抱歉
Sorry.

735
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,300
什么
What?

736
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,470
好啊
Awesome.

737
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,450
真希望美队现在能看到你
If only Cap could see you now.

738
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,710
好笑死了  我们怎么办
Hilarious. What are we gonna do?

739
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,460
{\an8}失物招领

740
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,330
你有通行证吗
Where's your hall pass?

741
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,760
我问你呢
Hey, I'm talking to you.

742
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,410
{\an8}田中老师

743
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,360
{\an8}布洛德韦尔老师

744
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,530
你可以的
You can do it.

745
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,920
马上够到了
You almost got it.

746
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,980
{\an8}世界上最棒的奶奶

747
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,390
小花生
Oh, peanut.

748
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,020
好了  我们走
Okay, let's go.

749
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,160
好啊  小伙儿  今天在学校过得如何
Hiya, champ, how was school today?

750
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,800
好了  有笑话赶紧说完
All right, get your jokes out now.

751
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,200
能不能把战衣修好
Can you fix the suit?

752
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,460
脾气真坏
So cranky.

753
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,290
要不要来盒果汁和手撕奶酪
You want a juice box and some string cheese?

754
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,890
你真有那个吗
Do you really have that?

755
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,070
看看福斯特说的对不对
Let's see if Foster was right.

756
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,330
{\an8}检测到信号

757
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,660
这肯定是实验室了
This has gotta be the lab.

758
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,480
我们去拿吧
Let's go get it.

759
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:56,610
好
Yeah.

760
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,190
看上去是这里
This seems right.

761
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,940
看看我们  一天组队两次
Look at us, teaming up twice in one day.

762
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,400
真让人不禁想
Makes you think, huh?

763
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:14,680
想什么
About what?

764
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,830
德国
Germany.

765
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,520
什么意思
What do you mean?

766
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:20,510
我们当时一起工作  一起训练
We were working together, training together...

767
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:23,130
还一起其他的
and other stuffing together.

768
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,550
如果我问了你  你会去吗
If I had asked you, would you have come?

769
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,030
看来我们永远不得而知了
I guess we'll never know.

770
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,790
但我知道一件事
But I do know one thing.

771
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,000
什么
What?

772
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,640
如果我去了  你就不会被抓了
If I had, you'd have never been caught.

773
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,670
斯科特
Scott.

774
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,550
你能不能暂时停止对我女儿做白日梦
You think you can stop daydreaming about my daughter

775
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,210
去把我的实验室拿回来
long enough to get my lab?

776
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:48,010
-是  先生  -谢谢
- Yes, sir. - Thank you.

777
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,260
好了  信号收到
Okay, you're transmitting.

778
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,910
怎么这么慢
What took you so long?

779
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,900
抱歉  我给我的蚂蚁想名字来着
Sorry, I had to come up with a name for my ant.

780
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,750
我想叫他尤利西斯·格兰蚁
I'm thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.

781
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,750
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}尤利西斯·格兰特是第18任美国总统

782
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,220
喜欢吗
You like it?

783
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,280
真好笑
Hilarious.

784
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,210
显示屏上什么都看不到
I'm not getting anything on the monitors.

785
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:09,740
有电子干扰
There's some kind of electronic disturbance.

786
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,670
你们小心
Be careful.

787
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,620
你知道我的  汉克  我一向小心
You know me, Hank. I'm always careful...

788
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,240
没事  只是那套战衣
It's okay. It's just the suit.

789
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,950
-你怎么知道  -看
- How do you know? - Look.

790
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,620
那是幽灵吗
That's Ghost?

791
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,560
她在干什么
What is she doing?

792
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,610
你觉得她是靠战衣穿墙什么的吗
Do you think that suit is how she goes through walls and stuff?

793
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,470
我们趁她还没醒赶紧走吧
Let's just get outta here before she wakes up.

794
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:31,210
霍普  看  实验室
Hope, look! There's the lab.

795
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,690
我们确定这是我们的缩小大楼
Now, we're sure this is our shrunken building

796
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,640
不是别人的吧
and not somebody else's, right?

797
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,950
快去拿  斯科特  我们得动作快点
Just take it, Scott. Come on, we gotta be fast.

798
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,300
我拿
I'll get it.

799
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:46,780
该死
Oh, shit...

800
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,950
霍普  霍普  汉克
Hope. Hope! Hank.

801
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,650
伙计们
Guys.

802
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:06,160
他们应该听不到
I don't think they can hear you.

803
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,040
我是艾娃
I'm Ava.

804
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,600
斯科特
Scott.

805
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,240
看来
So,

806
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,250
你不需要战衣也能
you don't need the suit to...

807
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,490
穿墙
go through things.

808
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:23,500
是啊
No.

809
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,600
它只是帮我控制这种状态
It just helps me control it.

810
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:32,390
本该也能抑制疼痛的
And the pain, supposedly.

811
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,760
你不会把手伸进我的胸膛
You're not gonna reach into my chest

812
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,320
捏爆我的心脏吧
and crush my heart, are you?

813
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:44,930
你真好玩
You're funny.

814
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,260
我不会伤害你的  斯科特  除非逼不得已
I'm not gonna hurt you, Scott, unless I have to.

815
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,280
我需要
I need...

816
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,160
你脑袋里的东西
what's in your head.

817
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,230
我们把其他人叫醒
Let's wake up the rest of the gang

818
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,760
赶紧开始吧  好吗
and get this over with, shall we?

819
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,140
醒醒
Get up!

820
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,080
醒过来
Come on!

821
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:25,290
爸爸
Dad?

822
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,260
你敢再碰他试试
Don't ever touch him again.

823
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:30,930
好了  霍普
Now, now, Hope...

824
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:33,520
我觉得考虑到一切
I think I'm being rather gentle with your father,

825
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,250
我对你父亲算温柔了
all things considered.

826
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,960
你说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

827
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:41,860
汉克·皮姆的自大的另一个牺牲品
Another casualty of Hank Pym's ego.

828
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,070
比尔
Bill.

829
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,970
你做了什么
What have you done?

830
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,340
是你做了什么  皮姆博士
It's what you've done, Dr. Pym.

831
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,640
你跟她一起的
You're with her?

832
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,560
天呐  我以为你挺好呢
Oh, man. I thought you were cool.

833
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,460
到底是怎么回事
What the hell is going on here?

834
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,150
汉克估计没提过我父亲吧
I doubt Hank has ever mentioned my father.

835
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,320
他怎么会呢
Why would he?

836
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:03,900
埃利海斯·斯塔尔
Elihas Starr.

837
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,700
他们曾是神盾局的同事
They were colleagues at S.H.I.E.L.D.

838
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,420
量子研究
Quantum research.

839
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:13,660
直到我父亲胆敢反对伟大的汉克·皮姆
Until my father dare disagree with the great Hank Pym.

840
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,150
你让人开除了他
You had him fired.

841
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,130
还毁掉了他的名誉
Oh, and discredited for good measure.

842
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:24,900
我父亲想自己继续研究
My father tried to continue his research on his own.

843
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:29,260
为了恢复名誉  他不惜冒险
Desperate to restore his name, so he took risks.

844
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,440
不不
No, no, no!

845
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,400
太冒险了
Too many.

846
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,990
直到出了岔子
Until something went wrong.

847
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,860
他叫我们跑
He told us to run.

848
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,030
埃利海斯  怎么回事
Elihas, what's happening?

849
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,960
快跑吧  跑啊
Just go. Go!

850
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:42,750
爸爸  爸爸
Daddy! Daddy!

851
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,480
我看得出他很怕
I could tell he was scared.

852
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:50,910
爸爸
Daddy!

853
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,980
艾娃  不要
Ava, no!

854
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:57,070
我不想留下他一个人
I didn't want him to be alone.

855
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,520
不要啊
No! No!

856
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,940
不要
No!

857
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:09,910
我醒来时  我父母都死了
When I woke up, my parents were dead.

858
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:14,180
我就没那么幸运了
I wasn't so lucky.

859
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,410
他们称之为"分子失调"
They call it "molecular disequilibrium."

860
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:25,270
这名字挺蠢的
A rather dull name, I think.

861
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,500
并不能描述它的可怕
Doesn't quite do justice to what it means.

862
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:32,700
我身体里的每一个细胞都被撕碎
Every cell in my body is torn apart

863
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,680
然后又被组了回去
and stitched back together.

864
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,980
一遍又一遍
Over and over.

865
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,260
日复一日
Every day.

866
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:42,590
我当时还在神盾局  接到电话说
I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D. when I got the call about a

867
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,120
阿根廷发生了量子异常
quantum anomaly in Argentina.

868
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,300
你好  艾娃
Hello, Ava.

869
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:51,460
我叫比尔
My name's Bill.

870
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:54,320
我曾是你父亲的朋友
I was a friend of your father's.

871
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,830
我给你带了礼物
I brought you something.

872
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,950
没事  再试一次
It's all right. Try again.

873
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:06,780
这就对了
That's it.

874
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:09,970
福斯特博士尽力保护我了
Dr. Foster did his best to keep me safe.

875
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:12,230
但神盾局的其他人
But others at S.H.I.E.L.D.

876
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,840
把我的病症视为机会
saw an opportunity in my affliction.

877
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,960
他们给我造了件控制衣
They built me a containment suit,

878
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,890
让我控制变相
so I could control my phasing.

879
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,960
还训练我成为潜行特工
And trained me to be a stealth operative.

880
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:26,800
他们把我变成了武器
They weaponized me.

881
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:30,120
我为他们偷盗  刺探
I stole for them. Spied for them.

882
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:31,960
杀戮
I killed for them.

883
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,260
我出卖灵魂的代价
And in exchange for my soul

884
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,320
是他们会治好我
they were going to cure me.

885
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:41,580
他们撒了谎
They lied.

886
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,720
神盾局陨落后  我收留了艾娃
When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed, I took Ava in.

887
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,490
我建造了这个舱来减缓她的衰退
I built the chamber to slow her decay,

888
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,500
但她的病情在加剧
but her condition was progressive.

889
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,150
我不知该如何治好她
I didn't know how to cure it.

890
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,080
她想杀你的  汉克  但我阻止了她
She wanted to kill you, Hank, but I told her no

891
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:56,500
而是叫她观察你
and that she should watch you instead.

892
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:57,350
不出所料
And sure enough,

893
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,540
她发现你在建隧道
she discovered that you were building the tunnel.

894
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,630
然后她又跟我讲了朗
Then, she told me about Lang.

895
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,310
以及珍妮特留在他脑袋里的信息
And the message from Janet inside his head,

896
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,450
于是我...
that's when I...

897
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:08,690
老天爷啊
Christ's sake!

898
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:09,990
是我的  抱歉
That's me. I'm sorry.

899
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,870
能告诉我是谁在给我发短信吗
Look, can you tell me who's texting me?

900
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:14,710
凯西  911
"Cassie, 911."

901
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,660
那是我女儿  我得给她回短信
That's my daughter. I need to text her back.

902
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,170
不  别想
No, that's not happening.

903
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:20,310
911就是紧急事件
What, it's 911. That means it's an emergency.

904
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:22,150
你没资格提要求  朗
You're not making demands here, Lang.

905
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,280
你不懂事态多么严...
You're not appreciating the gravity of the...

906
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,920
好吧  她在给我打视频电话了
Okay, look, she's trying to video chat me now.

907
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,760
可能真出事了  让我跟她说话  拜托了
Something might be wrong. Let me talk to her. Please.

908
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,440
凯西  你没事吧  什么急事
Cassie, are you okay? What's the emergency?

909
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,380
我找不到我的足球鞋了
I can't find my soccer shoes.

910
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,130
什么
What?

911
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,460
我明天还有比赛呢
I have a game tomorrow.

912
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:39,810
斯科特  我知道鞋就在那边
Hey, Scott, I know that they're there.

913
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:41,170
你能拿手机在家里走一圈吗
Can you just walk the phone around the house?

914
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:42,750
我现在不行啊
No, I can't do that right now.

915
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,720
-怎么了  -我病了
- Why not? - Because I'm sick.

916
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,560
你能不能稍后找找
Hey, can you just maybe look around later then

917
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,470
再打给我
and call me back?

918
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:48,600
拜托  谢谢
Please? Thank you.

919
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,040
再见  爸爸
Bye, Daddy!

920
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:51,680
-再见  小花生  -早日康复
- Bye, peanut! - Feel better!

921
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,260
早日康复  哥们
Feel better, buddy!

922
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:55,400
对不起  她说急事的
I'm sorry. It said emergency.

923
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,940
艾娃  我想帮你
Ava, I want to help you.

924
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,020
她不需要你的帮助  我知道怎么救她
She doesn't need your help. I know how to save her.

925
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:01,620
是吗  怎么救
Oh, really? How?

926
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:02,290
珍妮特
Janet.

927
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,400
她这30年来
For the last 30 years,

928
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,520
都在量子域吸收量子能
she's been down there absorbing quantum energy.

929
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,860
我们可以提取那能量
We can extract that energy.

930
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,340
用它来修复艾娃的分子结构
We can use it to repair Ava's molecular structure...

931
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,010
提取
Extract it?

932
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:11,760
-是的  -你疯了吗
- Yes. - Are you insane?

933
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,110
那会把珍妮特撕裂的
That would rip Janet apart.

934
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,280
这你不能确定
You don't know that.

935
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,350
我要开启隧道
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

936
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,390
等珍妮特的位置出现在朗脑子里
When Janet's location pops into Lang's head,

937
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:19,240
他就得告诉我
he's gonna give it to me

938
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,250
否则我就把他交给联调局
or I'm gonna turn him over to the FBI.

939
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,160
什么
What?

940
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,960
你给我留在这里
You are gonna stay here

941
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,850
以防我需要你帮忙
just in case I need your help.

942
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,470
我才不会帮你
Like hell I would help you!

943
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:29,820
我怎么说你就得怎么做
You'll do whatever I say.

944
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,630
你会害死珍妮特的
You're gonna kill Janet!

945
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:32,930
你还是多担心自己吧  汉克
I'd be more worried about yourself, Hank.

946
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:34,340
该死  比尔
Goddamn it, Bill!

947
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,670
-爸爸  -冷静  汉克
- Dad? - Calm down, Hank.

948
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:39,490
老天啊
So help me God...

949
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:41,030
药
The pills.

950
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:42,750
他的心脏  他需要吃药
It's his heart! He needs his pills.

951
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:43,860
求你  福斯特博士
Please, Dr. Foster.

952
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,490
药就在铁盒里  拜托了
They're in the tin. Please.

953
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,410
他会死的  拜托
He could die! Come on!

954
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:50,570
帮他啊
Help him!

955
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,310
爸爸  撑住了
Dad, just hang on, all right?

956
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:53,660
继续呼吸  冷静点
Just keep breathing. Stay calm.

957
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,220
帮他啊  快点
Help him, man! Come on!

958
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,580
那个薄荷糖盒
The Altoid tin!

959
00:49:59,150 --> 00:49:59,840
等等
Wait!

960
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:04,750
谢谢了  伙计们
Thanks, guys.

961
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:06,400
汉克
Hank!

962
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,900
比尔给那姑娘灌输了一脑子的谎言
Bill is filling that girl's head with lies.

963
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,840
埃利海斯·斯塔尔是个叛徒
Elihas Starr was a traitor.

964
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,760
他偷了我的图纸
He stole my plans.

965
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,110
往下点  锁定
Now, bring it down. All right, lock it in.

966
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:30,010
不不  螺栓在另一边
No, no, no. The bolt is on the other side.

967
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:32,970
把那个锁紧  往下拉一点
Tighten that one down, then bring it down one notch.

968
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:34,050
好样的
Good job.

969
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,140
会成功的
It'll work.

970
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,580
福斯特  要是他做  会烧毁系统的
Foster, he could have fried the entire system.

971
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,700
我们调整继电器
Look, we'll adjust the relays

972
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,690
你去重编程设置
while you go reprogram the settings, all right?

973
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:41,810
会成功的
It's going to be fine.

974
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:49,170
关键时刻到了
So, this is it.

975
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:51,710
是啊  按说筹备了这么久
Yeah. You'd think with all this time to prepare

976
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:52,730
我该准备好了
I'd be more ready.

977
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:55,680
你是没法为进入亚原子状态做好准备的
Oh, going subatomic isn't something you can prepare for.

978
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,890
那会模糊你的意识
It kind of melts your mind.

979
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,430
我是指再见到我妈妈
I mean seeing my mom again.

980
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,870
如果她完全变成了另一个人呢
What if she's a completely different person?

981
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,550
是啊  比如变成了乔治·华盛顿
Yeah, like, uh, George Washington.

982
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:09,880
我说真的  斯科特
I'm serious, Scott.

983
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,080
或是乔治·杰斐逊
Or George Jefferson.

984
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,140
如果她已经忘记了我呢
What if she's forgotten about me?

985
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,710
我在监狱时
When I was in prison...

986
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,700
唯一帮我度过那段时光的就是凯西
the only thing that got me through was Cassie.

987
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,750
我哪怕被关个100年
I could have been locked up for 100 years...

988
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,380
也绝不会忘记她
I never would have forgotten her.

989
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:29,300
我知道你妈妈肯定时刻
I know your mom is counting the minutes

990
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,690
都盼着与你团聚
until she can see you again.

991
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:33,960
谢谢
Thank you.

992
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,520
我们有大麻烦了
We got a big problem.

993
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,030
你忘记大楼后面的
You forgot the motion sensor lights

994
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:46,200
运动传感器灯了
on the back of the building.

995
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,590
糟糕
Oh, no.

996
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:49,160
提议案里有
And they're on the proposal,

997
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,990
卡拉佩特安还特地问到了
and Karapetyan asked for them specifically.

998
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:54,170
是啊  我们忙得挺疯的
Uh, yeah, look, it's been a little crazy.

999
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,220
这样吧  我明天过去  看一眼
Look, maybe I could stop by tomorrow, take a look at it.

1000
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:58,260
不行
No. No, no, no, no.

1001
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,500
明天一大早就要见面了
The meeting is first thing in the morning.

1002
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,090
你得马上过来解决它
You gotta come right now and fix it.

1003
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:03,460
我不能  我也想  但我不能走
I can't. I wish I could, but I can't leave.

1004
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:04,510
这样  我去找你
You know what, I'm coming to you.

1005
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:06,970
我带图纸过去  就在笔记本电脑上
I'll just bring the plans. They're on the laptop.

1006
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:08,110
你在那里修改
And you can fix them there.

1007
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:09,940
告诉我你在哪里
Just tell me where you are, okay?

1008
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:10,950
一言难尽
It's complicated.

1009
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:12,410
什么意思  一言难尽
What do you mean it's complicated?

1010
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,250
如您所见  先生
As you can see, sir,

1011
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,740
这套系统是最先进的
this system is state of the art.

1012
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,980
明日的安保系统  今日享用
Security of tomorrow, today.

1013
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,000
太棒了
Oh, that's so good!

1014
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,990
我喜欢你的探身  继续练习
And I love the lean-in, bro. Keep practicin'.

1015
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,100
我得开车去斯科特那里
Hey, I just gotta drive up to Scotty's,

1016
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,310
我们好修改图纸
so we can fix the plans.

1017
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:29,900
别担心  我回来时肯定还有时间
But don't worry, I'll be back in plenty of time.

1018
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,610
如您所见
As you can see...

1019
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,630
你们为明早把货车洗干净了吧
Tell me you got the van washed for tomorrow morning.

1020
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:36,150
底盘都洗了
Down to the undercarriage, baby.

1021
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:37,940
你还要了洗底盘
You sprung for the undercarriage wash?

1022
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,200
你叫我全洗的
Well, you said get the works.

1023
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:39,840
那是骗人的  哥们
That's a scam, bro.

1024
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,540
我们住在加州  又不是明尼苏达州
We live in California, not Minnesota.

1025
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,550
他说得对
He's right.

1026
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,110
洗底盘
The undercarriage wash,

1027
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,400
是为了洗掉除冰盐
that's for cleaning off road salt

1028
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,110
我们更爱下雪的姐妹州的道路上才会撒那个
laid down in our more snow-laden sister states.

1029
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,870
你是谁  你怎么会这么清楚洗车行业的规矩
Who are you, and why do you know so much about car wash protocol?

1030
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:55,470
我叫桑尼·伯奇
Well, my name is Sonny Burch.

1031
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:58,380
我很会做调查  路易斯
And I do my research, Luis.

1032
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:04,190
我还从一个联调局的朋友那里得知
To wit, I have learned from a friend of mine at the FBI

1033
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:06,620
你跟斯科特·朗相熟
that you are a known associate of Scott Lang...

1034
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,930
斯科特和汉克·皮姆相熟  我还知道
a known associate of Hank Pym, who I've also learned

1035
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:12,100
汉克有个便携可缩小实验室
has a portable shrinking laboratory

1036
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:14,480
里面有各式各样有趣的科技
filled with all kinds of juicy tech.

1037
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,190
你得告诉我  它在哪
And you're gonna tell me where it is.

1038
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,660
我真不想告诉你
Well, I hate to break it to you, but

1039
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:20,950
但我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

1040
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,680
你好像有点抵触  路易斯
Well, I sense a resistance in you, Luis.

1041
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:28,030
但我答应了某些危险人物给他们问出结果
And I have promised results to some dangerous people.

1042
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:32,150
所以  给你介绍一下我的好友  乌兹曼
So, I'm gonna introduce you to my good friend, Uzman.

1043
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:35,900
乌兹曼特别擅长
Now... Uzman is a master

1044
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:37,410
通过精神手段
at extracting information

1045
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:40,500
撬开不愿开口的人的嘴
from the unwilling through psychoactive means.

1046
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:43,540
那是吐真剂吗
Oh, is that truth serum?

1047
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,990
不存在吐真剂这种东西
There's no such thing as truth serum.

1048
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,950
那就是电视节目的鬼扯
That's just nonsense from TV.

1049
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,240
那它是什么
Well, what is it then?

1050
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,840
这是一种混合药剂
It's a little concoction

1051
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,900
从他当年还在MI6时  就一直在改良
that he's been perfecting since his days with the S.I.S.

1052
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:56,920
它会让你极容易受到暗示  有问必答
It makes you suggestible and highly responsive.

1053
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,100
哥们  那就是吐真剂
Well, dude, that's truth serum.

1054
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,080
不是的
No, it's not.

1055
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,170
无意冒犯  但是我觉得那就是吐真剂
No offensing, but they sound like truth serum to me.

1056
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:04,320
-是吧  -它不是吐真剂
- Right? - It's not a truth serum.

1057
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,840
好吧  我相信你
Okay. Hey, I believe you.

1058
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,490
不是吐真剂
It's not a truth serum.

1059
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:10,880
如果它看起来像吐真剂  功能也是吐真
I mean, if it walk like duck and talk like ducks...

1060
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:11,930
那它就是吐真剂
The truth serum.

1061
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:13,440
我过敏的东西可多了
Well, I have a lot of allergies...

1062
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,660
请你三思
so you might wanna think about that.

1063
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,390
我们得夺回实验室
We've got to get that lab back.

1064
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:22,460
怎么了
What?

1065
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,170
舱和战衣几乎无法帮你控制病情了
The chamber and the suit are barely helping anymore.

1066
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,910
我还能活多久
How long have I got?

1067
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,210
几周吧
A couple of weeks, maybe.

1068
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:38,500
那我们逼他们把实验室拿回来
Well, then we'll make them bring the lab back.

1069
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:39,650
怎么做
How?

1070
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:43,390
朗  他有个女儿  对吧
Lang. He has a daughter, right?

1071
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:44,620
你不是真想这么干吧
You can't mean that.

1072
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,680
艾娃
Ava!

1073
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:50,100
你在外面惹的祸  我都忍了
I tolerate a lot of the things you do out there...

1074
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,030
但这种事我绝不参与
but I won't be a part of anything like that.

1075
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,620
在渐渐消失的不是你  比尔
You're not the one who's about to fade away into nothing, Bill.

1076
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:56,650
而是我
I am!

1077
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:58,930
你说你能治好我
You said you could fix me!

1078
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:03,320
你保证过的
You promised.

1079
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:05,390
我知道  我会的
I know. I will.

1080
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,170
但不能那样做
But not like that.

1081
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:11,420
你敢碰那小女孩一下
You lay one finger on that little girl...

1082
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,410
我就不帮你了  我们分道扬镳
I won't help you. And we're done.

1083
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,080
好吧
Fine.

1084
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:24,330
还有其他选择
There are other options.

1085
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,990
你知道吗  你说得对  这不是吐真剂
You know what? You're right. This isn't truth serum.

1086
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:42,200
因为我一点感觉都没有
Because I don't feel anything.

1087
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,950
我撒谎了  我有感觉
That was a lie. I do feel something.

1088
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,300
这就是吐真剂
This is truth serum!

1089
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,480
吐真剂是不存在的
There's no such thing!

1090
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,420
好了
Okay.

1091
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:49,630
好了  好了
Okay, okay.

1092
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:53,090
很简单  路易斯
Now, I'm gonna make this real easy for you, Luis.

1093
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,030
好
Okay.

1094
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:59,530
斯科特·朗在哪
Where is Scott Lang?

1095
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,270
这事说来话长
Well, see, that's complicated.

1096
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,310
我第一次遇见斯科特时  他糟透了
Because when I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place.

1097
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:04,850
而且我不是指牢房D区
And I'm not talkin' about cell block D.

1098
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:06,700
他妻子刚刚申请离婚  我说
His wife had just filed for divorce, and I was, like...

1099
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,580
"该死  哥们  她在你蹲号子时甩了你"
"Damn, homie. She dumped you when you're on lockup?"

1100
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:09,260
他说"是啊  我知道
And he was, like, "Yeah, I know.

1101
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,770
我以为我能跟她白头偕老呢
"I thought I was gonna be with her forever...

1102
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:11,660
结果现在我孤身一人"
"But now I'm all alone."

1103
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,740
我说"哥们  你知道吗
And I was, like, "Damn, homie. You know what?

1104
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,440
振作点  你有新搭档了
"You gotta chin up, because you'll find a new partner.

1105
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,790
你知道吗  我是路易斯"
"But you know what? I'm Luis."

1106
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,160
他说"你知道吗  我是斯科特
And he says, "You know what? I'm Scotty,

1107
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:17,870
我们会成为铁哥们的"
"And we're gonna be best friends."

1108
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:19,180
打住  打住
Okay, hold on, hold on.

1109
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:21,000
我很喜欢听精彩的故事
I like a good story as much as the next person...

1110
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,020
但是  这些跟斯科特·朗在哪
but what in the hell does this have to do

1111
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,000
有什么关系
with where Scott Lang is?

1112
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,380
我快讲到了  就快讲到了
I'm getting there. I'm getting there.

1113
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,320
你投了币  就得听完整首歌
You put a dime in him, you gotta let the whole song play out.

1114
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,170
他就像人形点唱机
He like human jukebox.

1115
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:31,080
我奶奶开的餐厅里有台点唱机
Oh, my abuelita had a jukebox in the restaurant!

1116
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,730
是啊  只放莫里西的歌
Yeah, only played Morrissey.

1117
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,490
要是有人抱怨  她就...
And if anybody ever complained, she'd be like...

1118
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,650
墨西哥裔  我们喊他们墨兹
You know, Chicanos, we call him "Moz."

1119
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:38,700
然后她就说"不送"
Then, ¡adios!

1120
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:41,620
没办法  他忧郁的情歌让我们很有共鸣
What can I say? We relate to his melancholy ballads, you know?

1121
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,250
-朗  -好好好
- Lang! - Right, right, right.

1122
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:44,610
后来  斯科特出狱了
So, anyway, Scotty gets out of jail,

1123
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:45,300
他开始为汉克工作
and he starts working for Hank.

1124
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:47,080
这时他遇到了霍普  霍普却一副
That's when he met Hope. And Hope's all, like...

1125
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,020
"我不想跟你扯上关系
"I want nothing to do with you.

1126
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,620
看看我的发型  我超正经"的样子
"Look at my hairdo, I'm all business."

1127
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:50,640
斯科特就说
And then Scotty's, like,

1128
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,210
知道吗  妹子  我的心已碎
"You know what, girl? My heart is all broken.

1129
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:53,390
我可能再也不会爱了
"And I'll probably never find love again,

1130
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:54,610
但我可真想吻你
"But damn if I want to kiss you!"

1131
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:55,350
时间快进
But then you fast forward

1132
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,820
他们就爱上彼此了
and they're all into each other, right?

1133
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,680
然后斯科特说
And then Scotty's, like,

1134
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,120
知道吗  我不能告诉你
"You know what? I can't tell you this...

1135
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,080
但我要去跟美国队长砸烂一座机场
"But I'm gonna go trash an airport with Captain America."

1136
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,050
然后她说  真不敢相信你就那么跑了
And then she said, "I can't believe you split like that!

1137
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,390
回见了  蠢蛋
"Smell you later, dummy."

1138
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,810
于是斯科特就被软禁了
So, Scotty goes on house arrest.

1139
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:07,600
他不肯承认  但他心里觉得
And he won't admit it, but his heart is all, like...

1140
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,860
该死  我还以为霍普可以成为
"Damn! I thought Hope coulda been

1141
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,840
我的新真搭档呢  但我搞砸了
"My new true partner, but I blew it!"

1142
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,040
但命运让他们又走到了一起
But fate brought 'em back together.

1143
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,190
然后霍普心里就想
And then Hope's heart is all...

1144
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:14,860
我担心我不能信任他
"I'm worried that I can't trust him...

1145
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,480
他会再次搞砸  毁掉一切
"And he's gonna screw up again, and ruin everything!"

1146
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,000
然后我心里就想
And then my heart is all, like...

1147
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,130
那高档覆盆子点心代表了公司的负债
"That fancy raspberry filling represents the company's red

1148
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:21,860
我们只差几天就要倒闭了
"And we're days away from going out of business. "

1149
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:22,790
倒闭
"Out of business"?

1150
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:23,720
只差几天
"Days away"?

1151
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:24,790
该死的吐真剂
Damn truth serum!

1152
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:27,200
我其实是想保护你们的  我发誓
I was trying to protect you guys. I swear to God.

1153
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,230
我是想做个好老板的  但我们破产了
I was trying to be a good boss, but we're broke!

1154
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:30,170
卡拉佩特安是我们最后的希望
And the Karapetyan's our last hope.

1155
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:31,380
如果我们不去  我们就完了
And if we don't show up, we're done!

1156
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:32,640
这叫什么好老板
That's terrible bossing!

1157
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,260
该死  哥们
Damn, bro!

1158
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,690
这怪我  这怪我
That's on me! That's on me!

1159
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,640
够了
Enough.

1160
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:41,490
我要再问你一次
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

1161
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:44,150
斯科特·朗在哪
Where is Scott Lang?

1162
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:45,050
我这不说呢吗
I've been trying to tell you,

1163
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:46,370
他现在处境尴尬  从情感上说
he's in a tricky spot, emotionally speaking.

1164
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:47,630
从情感上说
Emotionally speaking.

1165
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:51,380
那斯科特·朗  人在哪里
Well, where is Scott Lang, literally speaking!

1166
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:52,760
森林里
The woods.

1167
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,540
森林里
The woods?

1168
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,940
雅加婆婆
Baba Yaga!

1169
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,190
什么意思  "森林里"
What do you mean, "The woods"?

1170
00:57:58,190 --> 00:57:58,970
缪尔森林
The Muir Woods,

1171
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:00,820
全景高速的第二条消防道路上
the second fire road off the Panoramic Highway!

1172
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,100
老天爷啊
For God's sake!

1173
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:05,950
雅加婆婆  晚上到来
Baba Yaga, come at night

1174
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:08,230
小娃娃们  好好睡
Little children, sleepy tight

1175
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:12,400
该死的
Damn it!

1176
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,120
如果那怪物拿到皮姆的设备
If that freak gets Pym's tech...

1177
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:16,430
我就再别想找回来了
I'm never gonna see it.

1178
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,390
我们怎么办
So, what do we do now?

1179
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:20,940
从联调局那里偷
It's easier to steal it from the Feds

1180
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,270
比从妖怪那里偷要简单
than from the boogeyman.

1181
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,540
是我  你想升个职吗
Hey, it's me. How'd you like to get a promotion?

1182
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:31,480
我知道皮姆  凡·戴恩和朗在哪
I got the location on Pym, Van Dyne and Lang.

1183
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,160
但你得马上去抓到他们
But you gonna have to take 'em down now,

1184
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,680
因为他们不会在那里待很久的
because they ain't gonna be there for long.

1185
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,250
等你抓到他们  你要把实验室给我
And when you do, you gonna get me that lab.

1186
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:38,960
知道了
Understood.

1187
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,100
好消息  先生们
Good news, gentlemen.

1188
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,480
联调局会替我们完成累活儿
Feds are gonna do the hard work for us.

1189
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,380
看什么呢  给我换胎
What are you lookin' at? Change my tires!

1190
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,010
好
Right.

1191
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,710
{\an8}线上近景魔术大学

1192
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,770
-先生  -不知道敲门吗
- Sir. - Can you knock?

1193
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:56,200
抱歉  先生  我收到条线索
Sorry, sir. Uh, but I just got a lead.

1194
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:58,650
我喜欢线索
I love leads.

1195
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,200
系统已就绪
System's in the green.

1196
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:08,830
线圈充电
Priming the coils.

1197
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,480
满电
Full charge.

1198
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,490
等隧道打开
As soon as the tunnel's open

1199
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:14,480
一旦你收到任何疑似是
let us know if you get anything

1200
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,870
她的信息  都告诉我们
that could be a part of her message.

1201
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:17,090
好的  没问题
Yeah, yeah. I will.

1202
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,280
那好
Okay, then.

1203
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,690
开始了
Here it goes.

1204
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:39,480
我们成功了
We did it!

1205
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:41,830
有反应吗
You got anything?

1206
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:46,090
没有
Nothin'.

1207
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:48,900
等一等  因为可能...
Well, just give it a minute, because it could...

1208
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,270
不
No.

1209
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:53,660
不不不
No, no, no, no!

1210
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:54,320
怎么回事
What's happening?

1211
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,380
要停机了  可能是我们的向量不对
It's shutting down. Maybe our vectors are off.

1212
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,910
我们都算过一百万次了  肯定是对的
We've gone over them a million times, I know they're right!

1213
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:00,040
那还能是因为什么
Then what else could it be?

1214
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,050
我不知道
I don't know!

1215
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:09,430
-斯科特  你干吗  -斯科特  别乱动
- Scott, what are you doing? - Scott, get away from that!

1216
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:10,340
斯科特  你别...
Scott, you can't...

1217
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:12,180
对不起  我不知道我还有多久
I'm sorry, I don't know how much time I have.

1218
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:13,880
我得改好算法
I need to fix the algorithm.

1219
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:17,810
相信我  在下面待了30年
Trust me, after 30 years down here...

1220
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,740
我都想得很清楚了
I've thought about it a lot.

1221
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:25,410
珍妮特
Janet?

1222
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,420
亲爱的
Hi, honey.

1223
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,390
小糖豆
Jellybean.

1224
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,100
妈妈
Mom?

1225
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:39,060
这并不是我所想象的团聚
It's not the reunion I'd imagined.

1226
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,660
太赶了
It's all so rushed.

1227
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,250
你俩做得太棒了
You two have done such great work.

1228
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,260
你们只需要一点点的
You just need a little...

1229
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:46,980
帮助
nudge.

1230
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:04,200
珍妮特  这怎么可能
Janet, how is this possible?

1231
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,350
你放在斯科特脑子里的不是一则信息
It wasn't a message you put in Scott's head.

1232
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:09,710
而是个天线
It was an antenna.

1233
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:10,950
真聪明
Clever girl.

1234
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:13,010
我好为你骄傲
I'm so proud of you.

1235
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:15,660
亲爱的  告诉我们你在哪
Honey, tell us where you are.

1236
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,280
告诉我们怎么找到你
Tell us how to find you.

1237
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,350
不  概率场太复杂了
No, the probability fields are too complex.

1238
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:21,040
所以我才需要跟你对话
That's why I needed to talk to you.

1239
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,460
你得追随我的声音
You have to follow my voice.

1240
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:23,650
当然了
Of course!

1241
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:25,800
就像追踪一通电话
Like tracing a call back to its source!

1242
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:33,740
我在用亚原子频率追踪你的信号
I'm tracking your signal using subatomic frequencies

1243
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,520
范围是1点和9点
between point two and point nine.

1244
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,140
最好缩小到4和6
I'd narrow it to four and six.

1245
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,490
太窄了  可能会错过你
That's too tight. We could miss you.

1246
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:41,220
看看我们  又在吵了
Look at us squabbling again.

1247
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:44,760
好吧  那就3和7
Fine. All right, between three and seven.

1248
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:48,140
我们数十年来第一次吵架  就这么结束了
Our first fight in decades, and it's over just like that.

1249
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:04,560
正中红心
Bullseye.

1250
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:06,110
信号源锁定
Source lock.

1251
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:07,430
是你
It's you.

1252
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:09,800
我们找到了
We got it!

1253
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,940
你们得去这个坐标找我
You have to meet me at these exact coordinates.

1254
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:15,470
在荒原里  越过量子真空
In the wasteland, beyond the quantum void.

1255
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:16,420
那里很危险
It's very dangerous,

1256
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:19,050
尤其是对人类大脑  务必小心
especially on the human mind, so be careful.

1257
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:21,690
时间和时空的规则在这里很不一样
Time and space work very differently down here.

1258
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:23,040
你们只有两小时
You have two hours.

1259
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,030
之后  概率场会变动
After that, the probability fields will shift...

1260
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:25,850
要再过一世纪
and it'll be another century

1261
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:27,650
才能再次这样对齐了
before they align like this again.

1262
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:28,840
我们会找到你的
We'll find you.

1263
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,960
我知道你会的  小糖豆
I know you will, Jellybean.

1264
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:43,830
不
Nope.

1265
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:45,730
没感觉  我完全没感觉
Nothing. I got nothing.

1266
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:46,920
完全感觉不到珍妮特
No sign of Janet.

1267
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,140
这可好
Perfect.

1268
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,750
我们怎么上来的
How did we get up here?

1269
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:57,800
好  首先你会看到好多光
All right, first you're gonna see all kinds of lights...

1270
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,200
然后会变得很颠簸
and it's gonna get really trippy...

1271
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,270
然后会一片漆黑寂静  非常寂静
but then it's gonna turn black and silent. Really silent.

1272
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:03,760
斯科特  我没事的
Scott, I'll be fine.

1273
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,030
我就是说说  因为我去过嘛
I'm just saying because I've been down there.

1274
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:06,430
嗯  你说过了
Yeah, so you've mentioned.

1275
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:11,960
抱歉  我得接一下
Um, sorry. I have to take this.

1276
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,540
哥们  你来不来啊
Hey, man, you coming?

1277
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,460
我不去了  但知道吗  幽灵要去
No, I'm not, but you know what? Ghost is.

1278
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:18,610
知道吗  联调局  他们也知道你们在哪
And you know what? The Feds, they know where you are.

1279
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,280
-什么  -对不起
- What? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1280
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,580
他们给我用了吐真剂
They gave me some truth serum.

1281
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:23,400
然后我突然就开始老实交待
And then all of a sudden I started talkin' all honestly.

1282
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,360
比如  我讨厌你用洗碗机的方式
Like, I hate the way that you load the dishwasher.

1283
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:26,730
我非常讨厌
I hate it, I hate it.

1284
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:27,610
但你得回家了
But you need to go home

1285
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:29,270
因为联调局可能正在赶过去
because the Feds are probably going there now!

1286
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:30,520
对了
And by the way...

1287
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:33,610
谁会把盘子放在最上层啊  就不该放那里
who puts the plates on the top rack? They don't go there!

1288
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:43,890
我觉得自己好混蛋
I feel like such a jerk.

1289
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:46,780
你们会气死的  我们得马上走了
You're gonna be really mad. We gotta go now.

1290
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:47,920
什么
What?

1291
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,290
幽灵和联调局都知道我们在哪了
Ghost knows where we are. So does the FBI.

1292
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:51,040
怎么会
How?

1293
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,160
-我告诉路易斯了  -什么
- I told Luis where we are. - You what?

1294
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:53,910
我叫他过来
I told him to come here

1295
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:55,700
我好帮忙修改卡拉佩特安的提议案
so I could help him with the Karapetyan proposal.

1296
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:56,750
天呐
Oh, my God!

1297
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:59,130
听着  我们必须拿到那个客户
Look, we need to land that account.

1298
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:00,420
否则我们会失业的
Otherwise, we lose the business!

1299
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,710
你们知道前科犯现在找工作多难吗
Do you know hard it is for ex-cons to find work these days?

1300
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:04,040
天呐  斯科特
Jesus, Scott!

1301
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:15,070
关闭孔洞需要90秒
90 seconds to close the aperture!

1302
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:16,960
我们得先给线圈消磁
You have to depolarize the coils first!

1303
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:17,680
我知道
I know!

1304
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,490
我很抱歉  但是
I'm really sorry, but the, um...

1305
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:22,520
联调局要去我家了
FBI is coming to my place so...

1306
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:23,980
我得走了
I have to go.

1307
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:27,490
我能借用下战衣吗
Can I borrow the suit?

1308
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:31,130
回转仪稳定器
Gyroscopic stabilizers.

1309
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,530
启动
Powering on.

1310
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:34,270
我要把战衣借走了
I'm just gonna borrow the suit.

1311
01:04:35,090 --> 01:04:37,090
我会回来的  告诉我你们会去哪
I'll come back. Just tell me where you'll be.

1312
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:38,690
-不必了  -什么
- Don't bother. - What?

1313
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:39,980
我们找到我妈妈后
We'll come and get the suit from you,

1314
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,390
会去找你取回战衣的
as soon as we've found my mom.

1315
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:43,270
-霍普  -斯科特  走吧
- Hope... - Scott, just go!

1316
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:03,010
-斯科特  -爸爸
- Scott? - Daddy?

1317
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:04,070
是我们  哥们
It's us, buddy!

1318
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:06,560
我们来拿凯西的鞋
We're here for Cassie's shoes!

1319
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:08,050
他肯定在休养
He must be resting.

1320
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:10,400
亲爱的  你上楼去你床底下找找吧
Honey, why don't you go upstairs and look under your bed?

1321
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,570
爸爸  你在楼上吗
Daddy, you upstairs?

1322
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:14,780
爸爸
Daddy?

1323
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:17,110
怎么...
What the...

1324
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:21,390
他现在真是脏得像猪
He really lives like a pig these days.

1325
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,350
爸爸
Daddy?

1326
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,160
散开
Spread it out!

1327
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,200
又来
Again?

1328
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,080
你们真不知耻
You people have no shame!

1329
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,700
监控器显示他在浴室
The monitor says that he's in the bathroom.

1330
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:40,980
我才不信
Yeah, I'm not buying it!

1331
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,610
凯西  让他过去
Cassie, let the man get by!

1332
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:47,120
但爸爸病得好厉害
But Daddy's super sick!

1333
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,150
我去瞧瞧看
I'll see about that!

1334
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:50,250
他说他不希望传染别人
He says he doesn't want anyone else to get sick!

1335
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,110
我乐意冒个险  亲爱的
Well, I'll take my chances, sweetie.

1336
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:54,630
他吐了  好多呢
He barfed. Like, a lot.

1337
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:56,050
小姑娘  我是联邦探员
Young lady, I'm a federal agent.

1338
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:57,990
我见过比呕吐物更糟的东西
I've seen worse things than vomit.

1339
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,100
好多好多吗
Like, "a lot" a lot?

1340
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,290
-是啊  -不管了  让开
- Yes! - Forget it, move aside!

1341
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:03,180
不要
No!

1342
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:12,530
-你怎么来了  -斯科特
- What are you doing here? - Scott.

1343
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:16,330
抱歉  我病得很重
I'm sorry, I'm just really sick.

1344
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,050
我说了吧
I told you.

1345
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:19,270
抱歉
Excuse me.

1346
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:21,590
有时就是得吐出来才爽  是吧
Sometimes you gotta just get it out. You know?

1347
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:22,730
抱歉
Sorry.

1348
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:31,500
我去启动车
I'll start the van.

1349
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:33,290
你拿实验室
You get the lab.

1350
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,870
别动  你们被包围了
Freeze! You're surrounded!

1351
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,510
汉克·皮姆
Hank Pym...

1352
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:55,280
霍普·凡·戴恩
Hope Van Dyne...

1353
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:56,800
你们被捕了
you're under arrest.

1354
01:06:57,910 --> 01:06:58,610
{\an8}诊断无问题

1355
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,870
这是骚扰
This is harassment!

1356
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:01,070
其实  不是的
Actually, it's not.

1357
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:02,780
联调局什么意思啊
What does the FBI even stand for...

1358
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:05,210
永远骚扰个人吗
"Forever Bothering Individuals"?

1359
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:08,860
-他的监控器没问题吗  -当然了
- His monitor check out? - Of course it does.

1360
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,300
该死
Damn it!

1361
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:12,980
看来我被骗了
Looks like I just got fed a bowl of malarkey.

1362
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,360
我们抓到他们了  先生
We got 'em, sir.

1363
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,980
皮姆和凡·戴恩都已被羁押
Pym and Van Dyne are in custody.

1364
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:18,270
真的吗  太好了
Seriously? Yes!

1365
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,800
抱歉  斯科特
Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.

1366
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,730
他们是你的朋友  这太不体谅了
They're your friends. That's insensitive.

1367
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,280
我太需要赢一局了
I just really needed a win, you know?

1368
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:26,680
好了  我会稍后回来
Anyway, I'll be back later

1369
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,570
正式结束你的刑期
for the official end of your sentence!

1370
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:30,390
抱歉看错你了  哥们
Sorry for misjudging you, pal!

1371
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:32,350
你该为自己感到骄傲
You should feel great about yourself!

1372
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:57,990
-怎么了  -有人受伤
- What is it? - We have a man down.

1373
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,410
皮姆的实验室不见了
And Pym's lab is gone.

1374
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:12,910
谢谢你掩护我
Thanks for covering for me.

1375
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:13,690
不客气
Sure.

1376
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:17,660
那么
So...

1377
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:20,820
你又开始做蚁人多久了
how long have you been Ant-Man again?

1378
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,030
没多久
Not long.

1379
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:28,380
就那么发生了
It just sort of happened.

1380
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,290
很抱歉我隐瞒了你
I'm sorry for lying to you...

1381
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:32,430
很抱歉我赌上了一切
and I'm sorry for risking everything.

1382
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:33,510
爸爸  没事的
Daddy, it's okay.

1383
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:34,540
不是没事
It's not.

1384
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,210
我做了些蠢事
I do some dumb things...

1385
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:39,990
而我最爱的人却为此付出代价
and the people that I love the most pay the price.

1386
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:40,950
主要是你
Mainly you.

1387
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,970
帮助他人不是蠢事
Trying to help people isn't dumb.

1388
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,670
但我几乎每次都搞砸了
I screw it up just about every time.

1389
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,700
或许你是需要有人照应你
So, maybe you just need someone watching your back,

1390
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:52,380
比如找个搭档
like a partner.

1391
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:55,060
她说得很清楚  那是她最不想做的事了
Well, she's made it clear that's about the last thing she wants.

1392
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:55,720
谁
Who?

1393
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,000
霍普
Hope.

1394
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,690
等等  你想的是谁
Wait, who did you think?

1395
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:02,320
我
Me.

1396
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:03,620
你吗
You?

1397
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,730
别笑
Don't laugh.

1398
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:07,670
我能做个好搭档的
I'd be a great partner.

1399
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:09,200
小花生
Aw, peanut.

1400
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:11,730
你肯定可棒了
You would be awesome.

1401
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,020
但如果我允许你做
And if I let you...

1402
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:15,620
我就是个坏爸爸了
I would be a terrible dad.

1403
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:17,410
好吧
Fine.

1404
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:20,690
那就让霍普做你的搭档吧  她挺聪明的
Then have Hope be your partner. She's smart.

1405
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,000
她让我想到了你
She reminds me of you.

1406
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:26,120
你要去帮她吗
You gonna go help her?

1407
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:28,500
我觉得你该帮她
I think you should help her.

1408
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:30,490
我也希望我能
I wish I could, but...

1409
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:34,490
但我不知道我要怎么帮她而不伤害到你
I don't know how I could help her without hurting you.

1410
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:39,330
你可以的
You can do it.

1411
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,560
你什么都可以做到
You can do anything.

1412
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:44,860
你是世界上最棒的奶奶
You are the world's greatest grandma.

1413
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:54,610
吴探员一小时后来见你们
Agent Woo will see you in an hour.

1414
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:57,020
一小时  我们没有那么多时间
An hour? We don't have an hour.

1415
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:59,120
你们有别处要去吗
You got somewhere else to be?

1416
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:09,270
这才是我的好闺女
Oh, now, that's my girl.

1417
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:17,250
好了  我们的计划是什么
All right, what's our plan?

1418
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:20,750
缩小那面墙
To shrink that wall.

1419
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,890
看上去像是承重墙
It looks load-bearing.

1420
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:23,860
天花板可能会塌的
The ceiling could collapse.

1421
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:25,250
那我们就没命跑
Then we run like hell.

1422
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,050
我估计这一层有15到20个探员
Now, I estimate 15-20 agents on the floor.

1423
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:30,050
楼里大概还有五倍这个数的探员
Roughly five times that in the building at large.

1424
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:31,400
他们都有武器
They're all heavily armed.

1425
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,570
胜算不高
Not great odds.

1426
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:34,530
你有更好的主意吗
You got any better ideas?

1427
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:35,530
没有
Nope.

1428
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:37,950
我不会放弃妈妈的
And I'm not giving up on Mom.

1429
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:40,250
她肯定会为你骄傲的
She'd be so proud of you.

1430
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:46,470
好了
Okay.

1431
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:48,950
一
One...

1432
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:50,840
二
two...

1433
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:56,960
斯科特
Scott?

1434
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:58,730
你俩傻站着干什么
What're you two just standing around for?

1435
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:00,370
我们得去找到实验室
We gotta go find that lab.

1436
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:02,610
那我呢
What about me?

1437
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:04,980
好啊
Perfect.

1438
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:06,980
快换衣服  我们没多少时间
Hurry up and get dressed. We don't have much time.

1439
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,130
先生
Sir.

1440
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:21,710
现在呢
Okay, now what?

1441
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,050
你问我吗
You're asking me?

1442
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:26,680
进来
Get in!

1443
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:40,960
打扰  我们打算赶紧离开吗
Excuse me. Are we planning on leaving soon

1444
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,960
还是你俩要继续互相凝视
or are you two gonna keep staring at each other

1445
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,950
直到他们开始冲我们开火
until they start shooting at us?

1446
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:46,180
好吧
Yeah.

1447
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,130
-伯奇  -嗯
- Hey, Burch. - Yeah.

1448
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:54,050
他们出来了
Yeah, they're out.

1449
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:55,180
我就来
I'm on my way.

1450
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,790
她的战衣不见了  车也是
Her suit is missing, and so is the van.

1451
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:02,820
怎么会这样
How could this happen?

1452
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,440
怎么回事啊
I mean, what the dickens?

1453
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,240
谢谢
Thank you.

1454
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:10,500
不客气
You're welcome.

1455
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:14,660
我们怎么找到实验室
So, uh, how do we find the lab?

1456
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:16,540
丢过一次后
After we lost it the first time

1457
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,480
我放了新的追踪器
I put on a new tracker

1458
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:20,770
算是吧
of sorts.

1459
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:31,250
这也行
That'll work.

1460
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:59,440
好没好啊
Is it ready or not?

1461
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:02,430
我们可以开始进行提取了
We can begin the extraction process.

1462
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,050
听着  艾娃
Listen, Ava.

1463
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:07,110
这整件事可能会很危险
This whole thing could be very dangerous.

1464
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:08,600
或许我们该
Maybe we should...

1465
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,120
或许我们该什么  等吗
Maybe we should what? Wait?

1466
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:14,150
我只能再活几天了
I've got days until I'm dead.

1467
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,490
我们要做了  比尔
We're doing this, Bill.

1468
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:17,760
马上
Now.

1469
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:23,710
能量读数显示他们还没用过隧道
Energy readings show they have not used the tunnel yet.

1470
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:25,700
妈妈的位置过不了多久就会变化
We don't have much time before Mom's location shifts,

1471
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:26,600
我们就会失去她
and we lose her.

1472
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:28,670
是啊  那之前还有好多事呢
Yeah, and we have a lot to do before then.

1473
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,220
我爸爸总说
You know, my pep-pep always said,

1474
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:32,400
如果你想做好什么事  就列个单子
"If you want to do something right, you make a list."

1475
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,660
我们该那么做
So, we should do that.

1476
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:36,110
一  我们要闯入实验室
One, we have to break into that lab.

1477
01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:38,930
二  我们要赶走福斯特和幽灵
Two, we have to kick out Foster and Ghost.

1478
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:41,060
三  我们得跟幽灵打
Three, we're gonna have to fight Ghost.

1479
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:43,800
这似乎该是二的一部分  二A吧
That seems like it should be part of two. 2-A, all right?

1480
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,190
就算是二A吧
Let's call it 2-A.

1481
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:46,880
打幽灵  二A
Fight Ghost. 2-A.

1482
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:49,380
还有  我们得确保实验室恢复到原始大小
Also, we have to make sure that the lab is fully grown

1483
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:51,040
好让你出来  否则我们就完了
for you to come back. Otherwise, we're screwed.

1484
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:51,670
斯科特
Scott!

1485
01:13:51,670 --> 01:13:53,000
要我再说一次吗  我再说一次
You want me to start again? I'll start again...

1486
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,580
我去
I'm going to dive.

1487
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:59,120
我们要想成功  就得你俩在外面
The only chance we got is if the two of you are out here...

1488
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:02,030
一起保护隧道
together, protecting the tunnel.

1489
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:04,870
让我去吧  霍普  求你
Let me do this, Hope. Please.

1490
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,740
让我去接她
Let me get her.

1491
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:11,210
我觉得他是对的
I think he's right.

1492
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:20,780
好啊
"Whassup?"

1493
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,750
不记得那个特火的广告吗
You don't remember, uh, that beloved commercial?

1494
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:28,350
"好啊"
"Whassup?"

1495
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:30,330
我让他跟我们过来的
I had him follow us.

1496
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:32,720
我觉得我们会需要帮助
I thought we could use some help.

1497
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,770
好了  我就位了
All right. I'm in position.

1498
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:38,110
蚂蚁过去了
The ants are headed in.

1499
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:38,940

Copy that.

1500
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,550
眼睛放亮了  斯科特
Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty.

1501
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,630
-来点糖吗  -不
- Do you want Pez? - No.

1502
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:45,700
我生日时凯西给我的
Cassie gave me this for my birthday.

1503
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,000
对了  我爱那套战衣
By the way, I love that suit!

1504
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:49,600
谢谢
Thanks, man.

1505
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:52,150
真希望我也有一套
I wish I had a suit.

1506
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:57,390
就算是没多少能力的我也会喜欢的
I would even like a suit with minimal powers, you know?

1507
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,470
或者就是一件没任何能力的战衣
Or maybe even just a suit, with no powers.

1508
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:17,530
怎么回事
What is it?

1509
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,370

她要面临死亡或更恐怖的命运

1518

她害怕

1519
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:14,750
等我回来  会帮你想办法的
I'll help you find a cure when I get back.

1520

现在我需要你退后

我做了个梦
I had a dream.

1671

你怎么还没找到妈妈

你似乎迷路了  汉克  你没事吧

还觉得你无所不知吗  汉克

是我
It's me.

我们回家吧
Let's go home.

1687

我以为我完了
I thought I was gone.

1688
01:32:26,670 --> 01:32:29,390
但你手里发出的那股能量
But that energy from your hands...

1689
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:31,080
你怎么做到的
how did you do that?

1690
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,820
我已经不是30年前的那个女人了  亨利
I'm not the same woman I was 30 years ago, Henry.

1691
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:38,060
这地方
This place...

1692
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:40,910
会改变你
it changes you.

1693
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,140
适应是一方面  但也有
Adaptation is part of it, but some of it is...

1694
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:47,830
进化
evolution.

1695
01:32:50,210 --> 01:32:52,670

1697
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:58,450
我或许该跟你说说上面的情况
I should probably tell you what we're dealing with up there.

1698
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:03,090
我拿到实验室了

似乎没人知道这是什么

它至少有80到85英尺

你们被楼压垮了吗
Did you get crushed by the building?

1732
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,410

It's probably in there.

1734

不在我这儿
I don't have it. I don't have it.

1735

看来我们要说
I guess this is where we say

1736
01:36:07,390 --> 01:36:08,680
再见了  哥们

怎么  你还担心她

不  对不起  我们不能这么做

这就是办法
This is the way.

1755
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:21,320

还有流动餐车这回事吗

你这次是逃脱了  斯科特

What? He's just awesome, okay?

441
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,050
他保护本地社区  很激励人
He protects the neighborhood and, you know, he's inspiring.

442
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,890
他激励我做个更好的人
He inspires me to be a better man.

443
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,590
好啊  蠢蛋
What's up, dickwad?

444
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,890
我以为你淹死了
Thought you drowned.

445
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,060
看来他名叫神秘客
Sounds like his name's Mysterio.

446
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,550
那句话
"L'uomo del misterio"

447
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,490
是意大利语  "神秘男子"
is Italian for "Man of mystery."

448
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,190
他们并不清楚他的身份
They don't actually know who he is.

449
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,220
神秘客
Mysterio.

450
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,090
名字不错
Cool name.

451
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:14,960
宝贝
Babe.

452
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,060
你看到了多少
So how much of that did you actually see?

453
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,960
没看到多少  我忙着跑呢
Not much. I was running.

454
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,620
是啊  我也是  我也忙着跑呢
Right. Me too. I was also running...

455
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,290
跑远
away.

456
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,390
明天去巴黎了
So Paris tomorrow.

457
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,720
去埃菲尔铁塔
Go to the Eiffel Tower.

458
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:29,990
应该很棒
Should be great.

459
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,890
我读到它建造的秘密目的是作为头脑控制天线
Yeah, I read it was secretly built as a mind control antenna

460
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,650
以制造疯子大军
to create an army of the insane.

461
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,390
所以那里是我整趟旅行最喜欢的目的地
Which is why it's my favorite destination on the whole trip.

462
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,590
你要怎么对付那个水怪
What are you gonna do about the water monster?

463
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,790
不做什么  它死了
Nothing. It's dead.

464
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,990
再说  那个神秘客都搞定了
Besides, that Mysterio guy's all over it.

465
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,950
我只想跟MJ一起玩玩
Look, I just wanna spend time with MJ.

466
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,350
我们刚刚聊起巴黎  我觉得她是喜欢我的
We were talking about Paris, and I think she really likes me.

467
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,520
真不错
That's nice.

468
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,450
让我想起了我和贝蒂刚相爱时
Reminds me of when Betty and I first fell in love.

469
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,720
我刚吃完我的水果馅饼
I had just finished my fruit cobbler, and...

470
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:07,290
联系你可真不容易  蜘蛛侠
You're a very difficult person to contact, Spider-Man.

471
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,150
你是尼克·弗瑞
You're Nick Fury.

472
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,520
你射晕了内德
And you just shot Ned.

473
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,020
只是温和的麻醉剂
Just a mild tranquilizer.

474
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,020
他不会有事的
He'll be all right.

475
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,950
很高兴终于见到你了
So good to finally meet you.

476
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,590
我在葬礼上看到你了
I saw you at the funeral,

477
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,620
但我觉得当时不是交换号码的好时机
but I didn't think that was a good time to exchange numbers.

478
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,450
是啊  那就太不合适了
No, that would've been really inappropriate.

479
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,620
-我不就这么说的吗  -是啊
- That's what I just said. - Right.

480
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,220
重要的是  你到这儿了
The important thing is, you're here.

481
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,820
我本想叫你来的
I tried to bring you here.

482
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,620
但你躲我  可现在你还是来了
You avoided me, and now you're here.

483
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,290
真巧
What a coincidence.

484
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,720
等等  这是巧合吗
Wait. Was this a coincidence?

485
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,650
我以前无所不知
I used to know everything.

486
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,620
然后我消失了五年再回来
Then I come back five years later,

487
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,620
现在我什么都不知道了
and now I know nothing.

488
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,220
没有情报  没有团队
No intel, no team.

489
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,690
一个高中小子
And a high school kid

490
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,850
都敢不接我电话
is dodging my calls.

491
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,490
我知道的是
Here's what I do know:

492
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:04,150
一周前  墨西哥一村庄被一场龙卷风摧毁
A week ago, a village in Mexico was wiped out by a cyclone.

493
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,850
目击者说  那龙卷风长了脸
Witnesses say that cyclone had a face.

494
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:15,850
三天后  摩洛哥发生类似事件
Three days later, a similar event in Morocco.

495
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,450
一个村庄...
A village was...

496
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,320
来查个房
Just making the rounds.

497
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,090
看看经历了今天的创伤性事件
See if anyone needs any emotional counseling

498
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,950
是否有人需要情感咨询
after today's traumatic events.

499
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,490
不  我们没事的  谢谢
No, we'll be okay. We're fine. Thank you.

500
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:30,120
很好  因为我其实没资格做...
Great because I'm... I'm not qualified to actually...

501
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,920
他睡熟了
Oh, he's passed out.

502
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,760
我反正也没那个资质  晚安了
I'm really not qualified to do it anyway, so good night.

503
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,720
那是我老师  抱歉了
That was my teacher. Sorry about that.

504
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,720
你刚刚在说
You were saying?

505
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,150
一个村庄被摧毁
A village was destroyed by

506
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,020
这可能又是一个威胁世界的...
what may well be another world-threatening...

507
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,390
宝贝  你还醒着吗
Babe, you still awake?

508
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,390
你不回我短信
You're not answering any of my texts.

509
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,120
他睡着了  贝蒂
He's asleep, Betty.

510
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,790
这么早
Oh, already?

511
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,520
-是啊  -好吧
- Yeah. - Okay.

512
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,490
所以  我们务必...
That's why it's imperative...

513
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,750
孩子们  今天那运河的水
Boys. So that canal water today

514
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,750
充满了危险的细菌
was filled with dangerous bacteria...

515
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,290
再有人来敲门
Another person touches that door,

516
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,650
你和我就又要参加一场葬礼了
you and I are going to attend another funeral.

517
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,240
穿战衣
Suit up.

518
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,990
如果你们俩有谁开始呕吐要告诉我
Let me know if either of you develop vomiting.

519
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,520
斯塔克把这个留给了你
Stark left these for you.

520
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,590
是吗
Really?

521
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,560
"欲戴王冠  必承其重"
"Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown."

522
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,120
斯塔克说你不会懂的
Stark said you wouldn't get that

523
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,650
因为不是《星战》梗
because it's not a Star Wars reference.

524
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,150
摘了面罩吧
You can lose the mask.

525
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,890
这里的人都见过你的真身
Everyone here has seen you without it.

526
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,450
你只是无故
You'd only be feigning anonymity

527
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,990
装神秘  还要隔着布料呼吸
and breathing through spandex for no good reason.

528
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,290
走吧
Come on.

529
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,290
好
Yeah.

530
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:57,450
那是玛丽亚·希尔
Over there, we have Maria Hill.

531
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,920
这是德米崔
That is Dimitri.

532
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,420
这是贝克先生
And this is Mr. Beck.

533
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,720
神秘客
Mysterio?

534
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:09,850
什么
What?

535
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,850
没什么
Doesn't matter.

536
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,820
我朋友这么喊你
It's what my friends have been calling you.

537
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,490
你可以喊我昆廷
Well, you can call me Quentin.

538
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,850
你今天的表现真出色
You handled yourself well out there today.

539
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,390
我看到你拉着那座钟塔了
I saw what you did with the tower.

540
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,450
我的世界就需要你这种人
We could use someone like you on my world.

541
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,450
谢谢
Thanks.

542
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,520
什么  你的世界
I'm sorry. Your world?

543
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,290
贝克先生是来自地球
Mr. Beck is from Earth.

544
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,050
但不是你的地球
Just not yours.

545
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,850
现实有很多个  彼得
There are multiple realities, Peter.

546
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,260
这里是616号地球  我来自833号地球
This is Earth Dimension 616. I'm from Earth 833.

547
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,090
抱歉  你是说存在多元宇宙吗
I'm sorry, you're saying there's a multiverse?

548
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,520
我以为那只是个理论
'Cause I thought that was just theoretical.

549
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,590
这将完全改变
I mean, that completely changes

550
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,120
我们对初始奇点的理解
how we understand the initial singularity.

551
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,990
这可是个永恒膨胀的系统
We're talking about an eternal inflation system.

552
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,950
那怎么行得通  那么多量...
How does that even work with all the quantum...?

553
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,150
真是疯了
It's insane.

554
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,350
抱歉  好酷啊
S-sorry. It's really cool.

555
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,060
不要为比其他人聪明而道歉
Don't ever apologize for being the smartest one in the room.

556
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,150
好了
Anyway...

557
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,920
它们诞生于黑洞中的稳定轨道
They were born in stable orbits within black holes.

558
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,190
是基本元素构成的生灵
Creatures formed from the primary elements:

559
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,790
气  水  火  土
Air, water, fire, earth.

560
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,320
科学部为它们起了学名
The Science Division had a technical name.

561
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,890
但我们喊它们元素怪
We just called them Elementals.

562
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:20,350
它们的变体普遍存在于我们的神话中
Versions of them exist across our mythologies.

563
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,090
原来传说都是真的
Turns out, the myths are real.

564
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,120
就像托尔
Like Thor.

565
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,020
托尔原是传说  但现在是我物理课的内容
Thor was a myth, and now I study him in my physics class.

566
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,790
这些传说是威胁
These myths are threats.

567
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,250
它们最初于多年前在我的地球上实体化
They first materialized on my Earth many years ago.

568
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,750
我们调动力量与它们交手
We mobilized and fought them,

569
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,260
但它们随着每场战斗愈发强大
but with each battle, they grew, got stronger.

570
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,620
我是仅剩的最后一支阻止它们的军团的一员
I was part of the last battalion left trying to stop them.

571
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,690
但我们只推迟了不可避免的结局
All we did was delay the inevitable.

572
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:45,090
元素怪又来到了这里  袭击相同的地点
The Elementals are here now, attacking the same coordinates.

573
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,350
卫星已证实了这点
Our satellites confirm it.

574
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,090
所以感谢贝克先生摧毁了另三个
So thank Mr. Beck for destroying the other three.

575
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,260
现在只剩一个了  火
There's only one left: fire.

576
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,090
它们中最强的一个
The strongest of them all.

577
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,220
摧毁了我的地球的那个
The one that destroyed my Earth.

578
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,790
也是杀死我家人的那个
It's the one that took my family.

579
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,490
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

580
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,390
再过大概48小时  它就会出现在布拉格
And it will be in Prague in approximately 48 hours.

581
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:09,350
我们只有一项任务  干掉它
We have one mission: kill it.

582
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,850
你要跟我们一起来
And you're coming with us.

583
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,090
抱歉  你是说布拉格吗
I'm sorry, did you say Prague?

584
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,220
弗瑞先生  这似乎是很严重的事
Mr. Fury, this all seems like bigtime,

585
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,920
很重大的  超级英雄的那种事
you know, huge superhero kind of stuff.

586
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,720
我只是友好邻居蜘蛛侠  先生
And, I mean, I'm just a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.

587
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,590
少来了  你上过太空呢
Bitch, please. You've been to space.

588
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,730
我知道  但那是意外
I know, but that was an accident.

589
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,350
先生  拜托  你肯定还能找别人吧
Sir, come on. There's gotta be someone else you can use.

590
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,150
-托尔呢  -去别的世界了
- What about Thor? - Off-world.

591

我只顾着自己恋爱  那很抱歉
if I seem like I'm preoccupied with my relationship.

我还是你的技术支援

我在想办法呢
It's... I'm figuring it out.

793
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,550
你得做点什么  彼得  拜托
You have to do something, Peter, please.

794

798
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:22,120
-帕克  -是  先生
- Parker? Parker! - Yes, sir.

799
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,520
那玩意几小时后就来了
That thing is going to be here in a few hours.

800
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,990
-我们让你无聊了吗  -他不是无聊
- Are we boring you? - He's not bored.

801
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,740
他只是在想被你绑架来的事
He's just thinking about how you kidnapped him.

802
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,400
他有困难
He had obstacles.

803
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,140
我解决掉了困难
I removed them.

804
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,110
他们还是不肯疏散城市
And they still won't evacuate the city.

805
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,640
白痴
Idiots.

806
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:38,770
怎么办  帕克
So, what's the plan, Parker?

807
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,270
我去大教堂塔楼
I will be in the cathedral tower,

808
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:42,770
留意火怪的出现
keeping watch for the fire monster.

809
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:45,110
等它出现  我就呼叫你们
When that shows up, I will radio you guys,

810
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:48,400
-然后我和贝克先生  -我叫神秘客
- and then Mr. Beck and I will... - My name is Mysterio.

811
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:54,370
然后我和神秘客就冲上去
That's when Mysterio and I will move in.

812
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,740
彼得  听我说
Peter, listen to me.

813
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,070
最好的结果  唯一的好结果
The best hope you have, the only hope,

814
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:59,770
就是现在阻止它
is to stop it here now,

815
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,510
不惜一切
no matter what the cost.

816
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,770
尽量带他远离市民
Maneuver it away from civilians if you can,

817
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:07,140
但最重要的是让它远离金属
but most important, keep it away from metal.

818
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,300
如果它长得太大
If it gets too big,

819
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:10,600
就能开始汲取地球内核的力量
it'll be able to draw power from the Earth's core.

820
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:13,570
那样的话  它就不可阻挡了
After that, there's no way to stop it.

821
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,510
我的朋友都在这里呢
Hey, man, my friends are here.

822
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,740
我忍不住觉得我们给他们带来了危险
I can't help but think that we're putting them in danger.

823
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,970
你还担心我们伤害你的朋友
You're worried about us hurting your friends?

824
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,440
你  调动无人机袭击你自己的学校旅游大巴
You, who called a drone strike on your own school tour bus?

825
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:33,500
斯塔克给了你一套价值百万的
Stark gave you a multibillion-dollar

826
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,970
现实增强战术情报系统
A.R. Tactical intelligence system,

827
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:37,540
你首先就拿它
and the first thing you do with it

828
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,800
去炸你朋友
is try and blow up your friends.

829
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:43,970
在我看来  你显然没做好准备
It's clear to me that you were not ready for this.

830
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,340
弗瑞叫我来看看你
Fury asked me to come up here and see how you were doing.

831
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,740
他对冲你发脾气感到过意不去
He just... He felt bad about snapping at you.

832
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,570
是吗
Really?

833
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,570
这个地球上有反讽这回事吧
You guys do have sarcasm on this Earth, right?

834
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,140
你感觉怎么样
How you feeling?

835
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,710
我没想到我这个暑假还得拯救世界
I didn't think I was gonna have to save the world this summer.

836
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,900
我知道这话听上去很混蛋  但...
I know that makes me sound like such a jerk. I just...

837
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:17,240
我本来计划好了跟我喜欢的女孩...
I had this plan with this girl that I really like...

838
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:20,340
现在都毁了
and now it's all ruined.

839
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,240
想要正常生活不叫混蛋  孩子
You're not a jerk for wanting a normal life, kid.

840
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,570
这条路很艰辛
It's a hard path.

841
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,170
你会看到一些事  会做一些事
You see things. You do things.

842
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,540
你要做出选择
You make choices.

843
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:40,640
人们敬仰你
People look up to you...

844
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,270
即便你赢得战役  有时也会死人
and even if you win a battle, sometimes they die.

845
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,710
我喜欢你  彼得  你是个好孩子
I like you, Peter. You're a good kid.

846
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:52,140
我心里有些想对你说
There's a part of me that wants me to tell you, just...

847
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,900
转身离开这一切
turn around, run away from all this.

848
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,400
但我心里又清楚
Then there's another part of me

849
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,270
我们要对付的东西是什么样
that knows what we're about to fight,

850
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,510
这关乎到什么  我很高兴有你在
what's at stake, and I'm glad you're here.

851
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:04,540
我也是
Me too.

852
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,770
但你担心你的朋友
But you're worried about your friends.

853
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,940
对
Yeah.

854
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:11,400
我觉得我总害他们有危险
Just always feel like I'm putting them in danger.

855
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:14,600
让他们待在室内
Look, just get them inside

856
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,270
在安全处待几小时就行
and keep them in a safe place for just a few hours.

857
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:18,110
他们会没事的
They'll be all right.

858
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,970
能有个人一起聊聊
It's really nice to have somebody to talk to about

859
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,440
超级英雄的事真好
superhero stuff, you know?

860
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,240
不客气
Anytime.

861
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:30,200
如果我们活下来了
And, hey, we survive this,

862
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:32,010
你还有一整个暑假能杀布拉德呢
you'll have all summer to kill Brad.

863
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,900
待会儿见
See you out there.

864
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,070
好
All right.

865
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:43,670
对不起
Scusi.

866
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,340
抱歉  那是意大利语
Sorry, that's Italian.

867
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,700
好了  伊迪丝  快点
Okay. EDITH? Oh, come on.

868
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,770
你好  彼得
Hello, Peter.

869
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,900
我需要想个办法让我的朋友们
I need to find a way to keep my friends

870
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,270
接下来几小时待在室内
inside the next few hours.

871
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:57,670
我们想想办法吧
Let's see what we can do.

872
00:46:58,310 --> 00:46:59,440
好消息
Good news.

873
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,470
我们要去看歌剧
We're going to the opera!

874
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,170
-开什么玩笑  -歌剧
- You're kidding me. - The opera?

875
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:04,400
别看我
Don't look at me.

876
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,840
不是说去嘉年华吗
What happened to the carnival?

877
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,540
这就是升级人生
This is upgrade living, guys.

878
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:11,140
来嘛  门票是旅游公司送的
Come on. The tour company just gave us these tickets.

879
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,370
免费哦
For free!

880
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,400
你们知道歌剧门票多贵吗
Do you have any idea how much opera tickets cost?

881
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,140
不知道
No,

882
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:18,870
因为我们没有人想去看歌剧  从来不想
because none of us have ever wanted to go to the opera, ever.

883
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,900
我觉得这是我们增长文化知识的好机会
Well, I think this is gonna be culturally enriching for us.

884
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,040
谢谢  内德
Thank you, Ned.

885
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,570
各位  这或许将是
Everyone, this is gonna be, maybe,

886
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,540
我们整个旅程中最棒的四小时

887
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,970
四小时
Four hours?

888

各位  我觉得这会很好玩的  真的
Guys, I think this is gonna be fun. Seriously.

00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,200
你们肯定都庆幸我让你们带身好衣服了吧
I bet now you're all happy that I had you pack a nice outfit.

890
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:41,870
是啊  因为我们更想去看四小时的歌剧
Yeah, because we'd much rather go to a four-hour opera

891
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:43,740
而不是全世界最大的派对
instead of the biggest party in the world.

892
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,710
再说一次  跟我无关
Again, don't look at me.

893
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:48,010

And therefore, I have value?

903
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,770
不  我完全不是那意思
No. No, that's not what I meant at all. I was just...

904
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,040
我在逗你呢
I'm messing with you.

905

我们坐一起吗
You mean, sit next to each other?

Why the hell not? Parker?

915
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:42,870
你不想跟我坐一起吗
You don't want to sit next to me,

916
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,140
还是不想要眼镜
or, no, you just don't want the glasses?

917
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:46,400
我不是那意思
I didn't mean that.

918
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,900
你先去吧  我去给我们买一副
If you go ahead, I'll go grab us a pair.

926
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,400
好吧  小心点
Okay. Be careful.

00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,770
很好  很棒
The suit's great. It's awesome.

945
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:16,340
射网处有点紧
It's a little tight around the old web-shooter.

946
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:16,920
帕克
Parker!

947
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:18,300

951
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,400
我不是很适应人多  要不我们...
I don't do well with big crowds, so maybe we should...

我知道怎么办
I have the perfect thing.

953
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,070
走
Come on.

954
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,100
别担心  宝贝
Don't worry, babe.

955
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,740
我们能远离人群  呼吸点新鲜空气
We'll get away from the crowds, get some fresh air.

956
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:46,710
你会感觉好得多的
You'll feel a thousand times better.

957
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:52,670
能量激增
Energy spiking.

我前两天还看他的报道了  不是他
I was actually read about him the other day. It's not him.

971

不  贝克  他吸收了旋转木马
No, Beck! He's got the carousel!

972

他在变大了
He's getting bigger!

973
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,010
他叫什么
What's his name? What's his name?

That's it! Nice! Nice! You got him!

997
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:28,640
不不不
No, no, no.

998
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:36,340
太迟了
It's too late.

999
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:39,070
不管发生什么
Whatever happens...

1000
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,240
很高兴我们相识一场
I'm glad we met.

1001
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,470
贝克  你要干什么
Beck, what are you doing?

1002
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,800
我上次该干的事
What I should have done last time.

1003
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,540
贝克  别
Beck, don't do it!

1004
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:58,770
贝克
Beck!

1005
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:20,140
贝克先生
Mr. Beck?

1006
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,540
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

1007
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,740
我真想亲你
I would totally kiss you,

1008
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:37,070
但我觉得我刚有点吐在嘴里了
but I think I just threw up in my mouth a little.

1009
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:42,470
我可能有薄荷糖
I might have a mint.

1010
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:45,440
结束了吗
So it's over?

1011
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:46,900
那是最后一个了
That was the last of them.

1012
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,640
但不会是我们最后一次面临威胁
But not the last threat we'll ever face.

1013
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,070
我们得保持警惕
We need to stay vigilant.

1014
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,740
这世界正缺你这样的人
There's a void in this world for someone like you.

1015
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:00,270
希尔和我明天要去柏林的欧警总部

You got gifts, Parker,

1019
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:20,370
但你不想来
but you didn't wanna be here.

1020
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:21,100
弗瑞先生
Mr. Fury, I...

1021
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,670
我希望你也能去柏林
I'd love to have you in Berlin too.

1022
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:28,340
但你得想好  你要不要挺身而出
But you got to decide whether you're going to step up or not.

1023
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:30,800
斯塔克选了你
Stark chose you.

1024
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,070
他让你做了复仇者
He made you an Avenger.

1025
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:35,240
我需要那个
I need that.

1026
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:38,470
世界也需要
The world needs that.

1027
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,400
或许斯塔克错了
Maybe Stark was wrong.

1028
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:44,870
是吗
Was he?

1029
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,740
选择权在你
The choice is yours.

1030
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:04,540
我们去喝一杯吧
Let's get a drink.

1031
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,370
我没到21
I'm not 21.

1032
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,840
你该庆祝  我们今晚做了好事
You gotta celebrate. We did something good tonight.

1033
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,110
是啊
Yeah.

1034
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,610
弗瑞是对的
Fury was right.

1035
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,070
托尼为我做了好多事
Tony did a lot for me, so...

1036
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,040
我欠他的  欠大家的
I owe it to him, to everybody.

1037
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:33,670
是吗
Do you?

1038
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,840
对
Yeah. I mean...

1039
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:40,540
斯塔克先生给了我成长的机会
Mr. Stark gave me the chance to be more.

1040
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,370
他希望我做的比他好
He wanted me to be better than him.

1041
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,140
弗瑞希望我不负他的期望
And Fury just wants me to live up to that.

1042
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,740
那你想要什么  彼得
What do you want, Peter?

1043
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:47,840
-什么意思  -你想要什么
- What do you mean? - What do you want?

1044
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,400
我不知道
I don't know.

1045
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,970
你想要什么  彼得·帕克  就现在
What do you want? You, Peter Parker. Now.

1046
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:53,770
我知道你在想
I know you're thinking about it.

1047
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,670
我想去旅我的行
I wanna go on my trip, right?

1048
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:57,970
我想回去跟朋友们一起旅行
I want to go back on my trip with my friends.

1049
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,900
跟我喜欢的姑娘
And go to the top of the Eiffel Tower

1050
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:04,570
去埃菲尔铁塔顶层  然后向她告白
with the girl who I really like and tell her how I feel, and...

1051
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,670
吻她
give her a kiss.

1052
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:09,640
闭嘴啦
Shut up, man.

1053
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:11,940
你不会那么做  是吧
You're not gonna do that, are you?

1054
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,700
-我不能  -为什么不能
- No, I can't. - Why not?

1055
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:15,940
因为我还有太多责任
Because I have too much of a responsibility.

1056
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,370
-天啊  非常感谢  -那是什么
- Oh, my God. Thank you so much. - What are those?

1057
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,200
-那是...  -伊迪丝眼镜  是啊
- Are those the...? - EDITH glasses, yeah.

1058
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,440
之前掉地上了吗
They were just on the floor?

1059
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,840
戴上试试  让我看看
Try them on. Let's see how they look like.

1060
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,840
-是吗  -嗯
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1061
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:32,270
我还挺喜欢的
I actually really like them.

1062
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:34,040
我能跟你说实话吗
Can I be completely honest with you?

1063
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:34,770
请吧
Please.

1064
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,770
丑爆了
They look really stupid.

1065
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:40,670
但或许还有隐形眼镜版本的
But maybe they have a contact-lens version.

1066
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:42,170
你戴上试试
You try them on.

1067
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,040
-不  得了  -试试嘛
- No, come on. - Try them on.

1068
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:46,170
-我不想戴  -戴上试试嘛
- I don't wanna try them on. - Just put them on.

1069
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:55,170
你觉得怎么样  孩子
What do you think, kid?

1070
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:02,000
"下一个托尼·斯塔克  我信任你"
"Next Tony Stark, I trust you."

1071
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:06,000
"给下一个托尼·斯塔克  我信任你"
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

1072
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:06,870
什么
What?

1073
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:09,130
斯塔克先生给我留下眼镜时还有段话
Mr Stark left me a message with those glasses:

1074
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,350
"给下一个托尼·斯塔克  我信任你"
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

1075
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:13,980
我还是不懂  你喝了几杯柠檬汁
I'm still not following. How many lemonades have you had?

1076
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:15,790
他知道我犯过的每个错误
He knew every mistake I ever made.

1077
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:18,790
他肯定也知道我还没做好这个准备
So, he must've known that I wasn't ready for something like this.

1078
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:19,950
那他为什么要把眼镜给你
Why would he give it to you?

1079
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:21,560
因为或许他不是把伊迪丝托付给了我
Because maybe he didn't trust me to have EDITH,

1080
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,540
而是托付我选个应该拥有它的人
he just trusted me to pick who should.

1081
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,290
这要合理多了  他一向知道我会做正确选择
It makes much more sense. He always knew I'd do what's right.

1082
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:27,420
他不会把眼镜给弗瑞的
And he's not gonna give them to Fury

1083
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,930
因为弗瑞只会自己留着伊迪丝
because Fury would give himself EDITH.

1084
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:31,220
这你八成是说对了
You're probably right about that.

1085
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,970
是啊  所以世界需要下一个钢铁侠
Right, so the world needs the next Iron Man.

1086
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:37,640
那不会是我的  我是个皇后区来的16岁孩子
And it's not me. I mean, I'm a 16-year-old kid from Queens.

1087
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,510
得是个大人  有经验
It needs to be an adult with some experience

1088
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,790
就像托尼·斯塔克一样好  比如你
and that's good like Tony Stark, like you.

1089
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,000
不  彼得  得了
No. Peter, come on.

1090
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:46,920
不行
No.

1091
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:50,670
-伊迪丝  -你好  彼得
- EDITH? - Hello, Peter.

1092
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:52,030
嗯
Yeah, um...

1093
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:56,250
我想把你的控制权交给昆廷·贝克
I'd like to transfer your control over to Quentin Beck.

1094
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,820
-彼得  你干什么呢  -做正确的事
- Peter, what are you doing? - Doing the right thing.

1095
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,450
移交控制权需要确认
Any transfer will require confirmation.

1096
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,200
斯塔克把眼镜给了你
Stark gave you the glasses.

1097
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,280
斯塔克给了我个选择
Stark gave me a choice.

1098
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,380
这是我要做的选择  我现在要选了
It's my choice to make. Okay? I'm gonna make it.

1099
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:09,190
你是个士兵  是领袖  你阻止了元素怪
Look, you're a soldier, a leader. You stopped the Elementals.

1100
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:12,130
你救了我  救了世界  好吗
You saved my life. You saved the world, okay?

1101
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,570
他会希望你拿着眼镜的
He'd want you to have them.

1102
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,390
等待确认
Waiting for confirmation.

1103
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:16,420
确认
Confirm.

1104
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,890
欢迎加入复仇者联盟
Welcome to the Avengers.

1105
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,250
你戴挺帅的
They look good on you.

1106
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:34,010
谢谢
Thank you.

1107
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:35,440
很荣幸
It's an honor.

1108
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,160
嗯
Yeah.

1109
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,360
斯塔克先生真的会喜欢你的
Mr. Stark would've really liked you.

1110
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,630
-你去哪  -去找MJ
- Where you headed? - I'm gonna go find MJ.

1111
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:47,390
祝你好运  孩子  我觉得你有一半机会
Good luck, kid. I'll give you about a fifty-fifty chance.

1112
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:48,860
你挺别扭的
You're pretty awkward. So...

1113
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:50,510
嗯
Yeah.

1114
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:53,110
-回见了  -回见
- See you later, man. - See you.

1115
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:27,290
瞧  并不难吧
See? That wasn't so hard.

1116
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:28,400
太好了
Yes!

1117
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:32,500
谁帮我褪下这身破戏服
Somebody get this stupid costume off me!

1118
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:40,820
好  我们拿到伊迪丝了
Okay, we got EDITH.

1119
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,460
把这个连上我们的系统
Get these connected to our system.

1120
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:45,050
敬酒
Toast! Toast! Toast!

1121
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:48,220
这是场重大胜利  但我们的任务还很艰巨
Now, this is a big win, but we still got a lot of work to do.

1122
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:49,970
敬酒
Toast! Toast! Toast!

1123
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:51,520
好啊
Yeah!

1124
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,780
好吧  敬一杯
Okay, toasts!

1125
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,230
给我  道格
Give me that, Doug.

1126
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,340
敬让我们走到一起的人
To the man who brought us all together,

1127
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,370
我们的前老板  托尼·斯塔克
our former boss, Tony Stark.

1128
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,200
小丑国王
The jester king.

1129
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:06,810
被财富和科技包裹
Literally wrapped in wealth and technology

1130
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:09,260
他却不配使用它们
that he was unfit to wield.

1131
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:11,280
就像我设计的全息系统
Like the holographic system I designed.

1132
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,880
那是革命性的突破
A revolutionary breakthrough

1133
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,200
有无限的应用前景
with limitless applications

1134
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,530
却被托尼变成了自我治疗机器  还改名叫...
that Tony turned into a self-therapy machine and renamed...

1135
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:21,290
二进制增强记忆重塑工具  简称"二重"[吐]
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF.

1136
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:28,410
我这个治疗实验花费了6.11亿美元
$611 million for my little therapeutic experiment.

1137
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:31,760
他把我的毕生心血改名叫
He renamed my life's work...

1138
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:32,650
"二重"
"Barf."

1139
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,310
我对他说这是个错误
I told him it was a mistake,

1140
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:36,350
我的科技可以改变世界
that my technology could change the world.

1141
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:38,800
然后
And then...

1142
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:41,240
他解雇了我
he fired me.

1143
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:44,160
说我...
Said I was...

1144
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:46,700
不稳定
unstable.

1145
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:49,540
敬托尼
To Tony.

1146
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:51,340
敬托尼

1147
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:53,300
接下来  敬威廉

1148
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:54,760

William!

1149
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,810
托尼·斯塔克在一个山洞里就造成了
Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave!

1150
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,910
用的是一堆破烂
With a box of scraps!

1151
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:03,390
我的幻景科技和你的
The integration of my illusion tech

1152
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,740
武器化无人机的结合简直绝妙
with your weaponized drones was brilliant.

1153
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:08,520
强大幻景  真实摧毁  屡试不爽
Powerful illusions, real damage, worked like a charm.

1154
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,700
而这还只是开始
And it's just the beginning.

1155
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,720
-谢谢  兄弟  -敬古特曼

1156
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:13,070
-古特曼  -敬古特曼
- Guterman! - To Guterman!

1157
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:14,180
你编写的故事
The story you created

1158
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:16,000
一个来自另一个地球的战士昆廷
of a soldier from another Earth named Quentin

1159
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,370
在欧洲跟太空怪物战斗  简直荒谬至极
fighting space monsters in Europe is totally ridiculous

1160
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:20,840
可看来现在
and apparently exactly the kind of thing

1161
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,180
大家就信这一套了
people would believe right now.

1162
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:23,790
所有人都信了
I mean, everybody bought it.

1163
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:25,520
-古特  -古特曼
- Gutes! - Guterman!

1164
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,510
-敬维多利亚  -敬维多利亚

1165
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,750
在每个袭击点制造电磁脉冲
Staging electromagnetic pulses at each attack site

1166
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:32,270
让弗瑞的卫星确认我们的谎言
so Fury's own satellites would confirm our lies.

1167
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:34,030
好点子
Inspired idea.

1168
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:36,090
-敬詹妮丝  -詹妮丝
- To Janice. - Janice!

1169
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:38,430
托尼死后  是她发现了

1170
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:40,340
伊迪丝没有被交给我们
EDITH was being handed over not to us,

1171
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:42,290
或是国防部
not to the Defense Department,

1172
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:43,700
而是给了个孩子
but to a child.

1173
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,460
-谢谢  -敬詹妮丝
- Thank you. - To Janice!

1174
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:47,750
也敬你们其他人  托尼·斯塔克死了

1175
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:51,240
现在有个机会  会有人站出来的
There's a window of opportunity, and someone will step up.

1176
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:53,900
但现如今  哪怕你是在场最聪明的人
But these days, you can be the smartest guy in the room,

1177
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:56,350
最有资质的人  也没人在乎
the most qualified, and no one cares.

1178
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:58,220
除非你披着斗篷飞
Unless you're flying around with a cape

1179
01:03:58,220 --> 01:03:59,970
或是手能发出激光
or shooting lasers from your hands,

1180
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:02,510
否则根本没人听你说话
no one will even listen.

1181
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:08,270
我现在有斗篷和激光了
Well, I've got a cape and lasers.

1182
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:11,150
凭借我们的科技  和伊迪丝
With our technology and with EDITH,

1183
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:16,060
神秘客将成为地球上最伟大的英雄
Mysterio will be the greatest hero on Earth!

1184
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,330
好啊
Yeah!

1185
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:20,050
到时所有人都得听着
Then everyone will listen!

1186
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:24,810
不是听一个酗酒的巨婴
Not to a boozy man-child.

1187
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:26,120
不
No!

1188
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:29,000
也不是听一个青春期少年

1189
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,350
不

你看我
Were you only watching me

1286
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,450

1287

对啊
Yeah.

1288
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:59,530

无所谓了
Doesn't matter.

- Wait, does that mean that...? - The Elementals are fake?

1298
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,370
但那没道理  因为我们在场的
That doesn't make any sense because we were there, right?

1299
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:47,610
现场有火  还造成了毁灭
There was fire and destruction, and...

1300
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:50,960
谁会做出那种事啊
Who would do something like that?

神秘客

01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:13,370
等等  你现在说真的吗
Wait. You're b-being serious right now?

1305
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:15,350
你没开玩笑  你百分百认真的吗
You're not joking with me? Like, you're 100 percent serious?

1306
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:17,190
-因为这不好笑  -我没开玩笑
- Because it's not funny. - No, I'm not joking.

1307
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:19,650
因为我本来只有67%确定
Because I was only like 67 percent sure.

好  真不敢相信我猜到了
Okay. Okay. I can't believe I figured it out!

1313
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:33,450
你夺走了我的一切
You took everything from me!

1314
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,170

01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,440
我们就能制造一起足以覆盖整个城市的事件
we'll be able to create an event big enough to cover an entire city.

1342
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,850
好样的  确保每台无人机都武器就绪
All right. Well done. Make sure every drone is weapons-hot.

1343
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:01,960
我们需要最大破坏
We need maximum damage.

1344
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,670
-那会死伤惨重的  -当然
- That's gonna cause a lot of casualties. - Oh, yeah.

1345
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:07,490
伤亡大  报道多  我得盖过其他新闻
More casualties, more coverage. I gotta cut through the static.

1346
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,310
伦敦是座美丽的城市  它会遭殃
London's a beautiful city, and it'll suffer,

1347
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:12,190
但他们能重建  如果我想做下个钢铁侠
but they can rebuild. I mean, if I'm gonna be the next Iron Man,

1348
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:15,300
我得在复仇者级别的威胁下拯救世界
I need to save the world from an Avengers-level threat.

1349
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:19,870
但等它的新救世主到来
But when its new savior descends,

1350
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:22,410
那些伤亡都会被遗忘
all those casualties will be forgotten.

1351
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,910
詹妮丝  你要就位  准备让我速换盔甲
Janice, you'll be in position with my quick-change armor

1352
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:27,070
-去迎接胜利  -没问题
- for the victory lap? - Of course.

1353
01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:28,950
-你想试试...  -不
- You wanna try...? - No, that's...

1354
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,860
我的手怎么了  怎么会这样
What's going on with my hand? Why is that happening?

1355
01:12:32,170 --> 01:12:33,920
从广场上回来的一台无人机
One of the drones that came back from the plaza

1356
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,760
丢了个投影仪  没事的
was missing a projector. It's fine.

1357
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:39,120
等等  你...你才告诉我吗
Wait, and you're...? You're telling me this now?

1358
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:43,020
就一台无人机  图像不会有问题的  我保证
It's one drone. The image will be perfect, I promise.

1359
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,390
那台投影仪是证据
That projector is evidence.

1360
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:45,550
能让人们知道我们在做什么
It's gonna tell people what we're doing

1361
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:46,730
怎么做到的
and how we're doing it.

1362
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:50,060
我可是在努力骗过70亿人
I am trying to fool 7 billion people here,

1363
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:52,650
包括尼克·弗瑞  他可是全世界最多疑
including Nick Fury, who happens to be the most paranoid

1364
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:54,790
也最危险的人
and most dangerous person on the planet.

1365
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:56,630
如果他在我杀了他前发现了
And if he catches on before I've killed him,

1366
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:58,030
他会一枪崩了我的脑袋
and he will put a bullet in my head.

1367
01:12:58,030 --> 01:13:00,470
没人想被一枪崩了脑袋  是吧
And nobody wants a bullet in their head, right?

1368
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:03,650
是吧
Right?

1369
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:07,770
威廉  你看着我
William, can you look at me?

1370
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,210
调出伊迪丝
Pull up EDITH.

1371
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:14,400
你好  昆廷
Hello, Quentin.

1372
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,190
亲爱的  启动五级搜索
Hi, honey. I need a level-five search,

1373
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:18,130
全资源协议  查找这个装置
full-resource protocol for this device.

1374
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:19,490
正在放大
Magnifying.

1375
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:23,230
那里  搜索进出那栋建筑的一切
There. Search everything going in and out of that building.

1376
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:25,210
已找到
Located.

1377
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:27,840
该死
Shit.

1378
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:33,170
威廉  有一天
You know, William, one day,

1379
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:35,890
等我因为这个不得不杀了彼得·帕克
after I've had to kill Peter Parker because of this,

1380
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:39,890
我希望你记得  他的血是沾在你手上的
I hope you remember that his blood is on your hands!

1381
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,230
真不敢相信我把眼镜给了贝克
I can't believe I gave Beck those glasses.

1382
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:46,590
我怎么能那么蠢
I mean, how could I be that stupid?

1383
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,260
他大概此刻正在监视我
He's probably spying on me right now

1384
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:50,170
或是派无人机来杀我
or sending a drone to come and kill me.

1385
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:53,060
你还能调用杀人无人机吗
You had access to killer drones?

1386
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:54,240
对  我并没想要的
Yeah, I didn't really want them,

1387
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,250
尤其是在我差点杀了布拉德之后
especially after I almost killed Brad.

1388
01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:58,260
你差点杀了布拉德
You almost killed Brad?

1389
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:00,190
听着  我得打给弗瑞先生
Look, I have to call Mr. Fury

1390
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:01,830
告诉他贝克是骗子
and tell him that Beck's a fraud, but...

1391
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:03,350
但他应该监听了我的电话
I think he tapped my phone.

1392
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:04,710
好吧  那你怎么办
Okay. So, what are you gonna do?

1393
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:06,660
我需要我的战衣
I need my suit,

1394
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:09,980
我得去柏林  跟弗瑞先生当面说
and I have to go to Berlin and talk to Mr. Fury in person.

1395
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:15,750
那个...
Just...

1396
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:36,740
内德  太好了
Ned, perfect.

1397
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:38,860
这戏服太棒了
The costume looks great...

1398
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,600
穿去化装舞会太合适了
for the costume party

1399
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,990
就在王子城堡
at the prince's castle.

1400
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,370
她知道了  我告诉她了
She knows. I told her.

1401
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,940
不是他告诉我的  是我猜到的
He didn't tell me. I figured it out.

1402
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:51,420
太棒了
That's cool.

1403
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:52,960
老早就猜到了
Like, a long time ago.

1404
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,120
神秘客是个骗子
Look, Mysterio is a fraud.

1405
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:58,450
但他救了我和贝蒂
But he saved me and Betty's lives.

1406
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:00,520
不  他用幻景科技伪造了整件事
No. He's been faking the whole thing with illusion tech.

1407
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:03,380
对  他使用了全息投影仪
Yeah, he's using these, like, hologram projectors.

1408
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:05,860
真疯狂
That's crazy.

1409
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:06,810
是啊
Yeah.

1410
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:12,390
所以你们是要一起查案吗
So you guys were like working the case together or what?

1411
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:13,580
主要是靠我
It's been mostly me.

1412
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:16,450
内德  打给梅  让她打给哈林顿老师
Look, Ned, I need you to call May, get her to call Mr. Harrington,

1413
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:18,350
说她希望我去柏林亲戚家住
say that she wanted me to stay with family in Berlin,

1414
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:19,680
等待风波过去  好吗
until this all blows over. Okay?

1415
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,910
好的  轻松
Got it. Easy.

1416
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:23,240
你们撒谎真是驾轻就熟
You guys lie with such ease.

1417
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:24,850
我得走了
I gotta go.

1418
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,110
等等  投影仪
Wait, wait, wait. The projector.

1419
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,520
你会需要这个的
You're gonna need this.

1420
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,320
别跟任何人说
Don't tell anyone about this, okay?

1421
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:32,870
知道的人都会有危险
Anyone who knows is in danger.

1422
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:42,380
所以  你也知道了
So you know too.

1423
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:45,730
真酷  虽然是我先知道的  而且要更早
It's cool. I mean, I've known first, and I've known longer,

1424
01:15:45,730 --> 01:15:47,290
但又不是什么竞争
but it's not a competition.

1425
01:15:57,610 --> 01:15:59,360
{\an8}{\pos(241.2,122.666)}德国  柏林

1426
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,640
不好意思  你知道哪...
Excuse me. Do you know where...?

1427
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:13,890
-夜猴侠  -不  等等  我不...天啊
- Nacht Monkey! - No, wait, I didn't... Oh, man.

1428
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:17,490
上车
Get in.

1429
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:24,990
弗瑞先生
Mr. Fury...

1430
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:27,630
你要解释很多事了
You've got a lot of explaining to do.

1431
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:29,780
-不不  听着  -等安全了再说
- No, no, no, listen. - Wait until we're secure.

1432
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:31,170
好
Okay.

1433
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:37,470
对哦
Right.

1434
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:06,590
你要跟我们说说
So is there anything you want to tell us

1435
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:07,720
你的女朋友吗
about your girlfriend?

1436
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,210
他是指伊迪丝
He's talking about EDITH.

1437
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:10,830
我知道我犯了个错误  我很抱歉
Look, I know I made a mistake, I'm sorry,

1438
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:12,390
但他不是你想的那样
but he is not who you think he is.

1439
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:14,570
贝克是个骗子  神秘客  元素怪
Beck is a liar. Mysterio, the Elementals,

1440
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:16,890
都是假的  他有种幻景科技
it's all fake. He has some illusion tech.

1441
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:19,830
他就是这样骗了你们  还骗我把伊迪丝交给了他
And that's how he tricked you guys, and me into giving him EDITH.

1442
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:21,290
这是个投影仪
It's a projector.

1443
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:23,860
我从布拉格的火怪身上拽下来的
I pulled it off the fire monster in Prague.

1444
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:27,220
我们看到的一切死亡和毁灭
So all that death and destruction we witnessed

1445
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:28,850
都是这个假造的
was created by this?

1446
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:31,490
不  不光是这个  我觉得他在用无人机
No, not just this. I think he's using drones.

1447
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:32,970
如果真是如此
Well, if this is true,

1448
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:36,430
那贝克就非常危险  我们也得机智应对
then Beck's very dangerous and we need to be smart.

1449
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:38,200
你还告诉谁了
Who else did you tell about this?

1450
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,260
帕克  帕克
Parker? Parker!

1451
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:43,920
-怎么了  -贝克  他在这儿
- What's wrong? - It's Beck. He's here.

1452
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:46,440
什么  希尔
What? Hill?

1453
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,330
不  只是幻...
No, it's just an illu...

1454
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,150
弗瑞
Fury!

1455
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:01,940
彼得
Peter.

1456
01:18:03,390 --> 01:18:04,770
我以为我们很要好呢
I thought we were close.

1457
01:18:05,530 --> 01:18:08,820
弗瑞本就必须死  但你不一样
Fury always had to die, but not you.

1458
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:10,510
别躲了  贝克
Stop hiding, Beck!

1459
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:14,730
我本想帮你离开这一切
I tried to help you walk away.

1460
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,780
这下你逼我不得不动手了
Now you're making me do this.

1461
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,440
是你说  你只是个孩子
You told me, you were just a kid.

1462
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,990
是你说  你想去追那姑娘
You told me, you wanted to run after that girl.

1463
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,370
-救命  -MJ
- Help me! - MJ!

1464
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:32,860
天啊
Oh, God!

1465
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:36,840
彼得  怎么回事
Peter, what's going on?

1466
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,370
我知道这是假的
I know this isn't real.

1467
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,820
你确定吗
Do you, though?

1468
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:41,860
MJ
MJ!

1469
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:43,410
MJ
MJ!

1470
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:49,060
我看你分不清真假了  彼得
I don't think you know what's real, Peter.

1471
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:03,850
你需要醒过来
You need to wake up!

1472
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,370
看看你自己
I mean, look at yourself.

1473
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:42,120
你只是个害怕的孩子
You are just a scared little kid

1474
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,660
穿着件运动衫
in a sweat suit.

1475
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:46,450
我创造了神秘客
I created Mysterio

1476
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:50,140
好给世界一个可以信仰的人
to give the world someone to believe in.

1477
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:51,690
我控制真相
I control the truth.

1478
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:54,700
神秘客就是真相
Mysterio is the truth.

1479
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,500
如果你真够好
If you were good enough,

1480
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,870
或许托尼就不会死了
maybe Tony would still be alive.

1481
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,790
{\an8}安托尼·爱德华·斯塔克

1482
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:38,330
内心深处  你知道我是对的
Deep down, you know I'm right.

1483
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,240
你自己做了选择
You made your choice.

1484
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:53,420
你只需要让位
And all you had to do was step aside.

1485
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:57,500
现在你...
And now you have...

1486
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:10,090
弗瑞
Fury.

1487
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:13,520
贝克的人想找到

谁会做下一个钢铁侠

我不知道那是不是我  哈皮  我不是钢铁侠

1579
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:51,380
你不是钢铁侠
You're not Iron Man.

1580

你也不会成为钢铁侠

没人能达到托尼的境界
Nobody could live up to Tony.

1582

托尼都不能
Not even Tony.

托尼是我最好的朋友
Tony was my best friend.

1584
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:04,980
但他状态很糟
And he was a mess.

1585
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:07,040
他总质疑自己做的一切
He second-guessed everything he did.

1586
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,600
心里乱得很
He was all over the place.

1587
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:11,450
他唯一没质疑过的抉择
The one thing that he did that he didn't second-guess

1588
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:12,500
就是选你

1589
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:17,200
我觉得托尼那么做
I don't think Tony would have done what he did

1590
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:19,790
是因为他知道等他不在了
if he didn't know that you were gonna be here

1591
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:20,900
你肯定会挺身而出
after he was gone.

1592
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,380
你的朋友们有麻烦了
Now, your friends are in trouble,

1593

你孤身一人  你的装备不见了

你打算怎么办
What are you gonna do about it?

1595

我要去扁他
I'm gonna kick his ass.

我是指现在  我们具体要做什么
I mean, right now. Like specifically, what are we gonna do?

1597
01:27:41,170 --> 01:27:42,950
因为我们在一片郁金香花田上空

1599
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:45,900
好吧  我不能给我的朋友们打电话
Right. I can't call my friends

1600
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,290
因为他在追踪他们的手机
because he's tracking their phones.

1601
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:48,590
把你的手机给我
Give me your phone.

01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,640
"密码"这个词
"Password," Spelled out, password.

1608
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:58,480
你作为安全主管
You're the head of security,

1609
01:27:58,490 --> 01:27:59,730
居然用"密码"做密码
and your password is "Password"?

1610
01:27:59,730 --> 01:28:01,040
我也挺不好意思的
I don't feel good about it either.

1638
01:29:50,370 --> 01:29:52,070
不不  我是在说彼得
No, no, I'm talking about Peter.

1639
01:29:52,070 --> 01:29:54,150
难道没别人注意到他多可疑吗
Has no one else here noticed how shady he is?

1640
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,790
因为我看到他只穿内裤跟个女人
Because I saw him in the back room of a rest stop

1641
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:57,850
在一个休息站的后屋里
with some woman in his underwear,

1642
01:29:57,850 --> 01:29:59,430
而且他总偷偷溜走
and he's always sneaking away,

1643
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,460
比如在歌剧院时
like back at the opera, huh?

1644
01:30:01,470 --> 01:30:03,130
现在他又突然离队
And, now what, he's suddenly off the trip,

1645
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:04,840
去柏林找亲戚了
like with his family in Berlin?

1646
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:07,410
难道没有别人想知道真相吗
Is no one else here interested in the truth?

1647
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:10,970
"客观事实的概念
"The very concept of objective truth

1648
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:12,430
都在从这世上消失"
is fading out of the world."

1649
01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:14,700
乔治·奥威尔  谢谢  MJ
George Orwell. Thank you, MJ.

1650
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:16,890
是啊  既然彼得不在
Yeah. Well, I mean, since Peter's not really here

1651
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:18,030
不能讲出他的事实
to tell his truth,

1652
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,820
那你的事实呢  布拉德
what about you, Brad?

1653
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:22,160
你为什么觉得你可以拍人上厕所的照片
Why do you think it's cool to take pictures of people in the bathroom?

1654
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,940
是啊  哥们  那怎么回事
Yeah, dude, what's that about?

1655
01:30:24,130 --> 01:30:26,090
不不  不是那样的
No, no, no, it wasn't like that. It was...

1656
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:27,550
我是想...
I was trying to take a...

1657
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:29,820
我们忘记这一切的疯狂吧
Let's just put all this craziness behind us

1658
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:33,000
度过一个美好平和的下午
and have a nice, peaceful afternoon.

1659
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:36,470
"好啊  哈林顿老师"同学们说  好
"Sounds great, Mr. Harrington," Said the class. Okay.

1660
01:30:37,460 --> 01:30:39,160
我现在要做个酷老师
I'm gonna be a cool teacher right now.

1661
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:42,520
你别再那么做了  是很奇怪
You gotta stop doing that. Okay? It is weird.

1662
01:30:42,810 --> 01:30:44,160
再不许在厕所里拍照了
No more photos in the bathroom.

1663
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:46,450
不管是小便池还是隔间
Urinal or stalls.

1664
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:47,350
-好吗  -看啊
- Okay? - Look at this.

1665
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:49,550
哈林顿先生  请吧
Mr. Harrington, come on,

1666
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:51,040
-这是你们的大巴  -我们有自己的大巴呢
- this is your bus. - We got a bus all to ourselves.

1667
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,000
见到你们很高兴  来吧
Nice to see you all. Come along.

1668
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:55,340
-给我吧  好  -走吧  谢谢
- I'll get this, yeah? Why not? - Let's go. Thank you.

1669
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:56,740
嗯  谢谢
Yeah. Thank you, brother.

1670
01:30:57,340 --> 01:30:58,150
好的
All right.

1671
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:00,350
孩子们接到了
I have the kids.

1672
01:31:04,930 --> 01:31:06,230
我尽快赶过来了
I got here as fast as I could.

1673
01:31:06,310 --> 01:31:08,920
我把周边扫了一遍  没有发现
I did a full perimeter sweep. Nothing.

1674
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:10,800
该死
Damn it.

1675
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:14,460
脉冲在激增
Pulse is spiking.

1676
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:15,460
我再去看看
I'll take another look.

1677
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:17,320
你一看到什么  马上报告
Soon as you see something, report.

1678
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:19,630
我们只剩你了  贝克
You're all we've got, Beck.

1679
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:21,560
如果这是我担心的那样
If this is what I fear,

1680
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:22,940
那上帝保佑我们了  弗瑞
then God help us, Fury.

1681
01:31:24,170 --> 01:31:25,220
上帝保佑我们所有人
God help us all.

1682
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:28,950
好的  没有复仇者来  我们可以开始了
Okay, people, no Avengers coming. We're good to go.

1683
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:31,700
-威廉  启动无人机  -收到  兄弟
- William, launch the drones. - Copy that, brother.

1684
01:31:31,790 --> 01:31:35,120
无人机进入大气层  武器就绪
Drones are entering the atmosphere weapons-hot.

1685
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:43,190
-很好  詹妮丝  -还在熨斗篷呢
- Excellent. Janice? - Still working on the cape.

1686
01:31:43,190 --> 01:31:44,140
把褶子都熨平了
You gotta get those wrinkles out.

1687
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:46,310
再过几小时  我真可能要跟女王握手了
In a few hours, I could literally be shaking hands with the queen.

1688
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:47,930
-古特曼  -马上就位
- Guterman? - Almost in position.

1689
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:50,200
-好  来吧  维多利亚  -增强脉冲
- Okay. Hit it, Victoria. - Increasing pulse.

1690
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:53,400
不管是什么
Whatever this thing is,

1691
01:31:53,410 --> 01:31:55,610
它比之前的强100倍
it's 100 times bigger than the previous ones.

1692
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:56,420
伊迪丝
Edith?

1693
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:57,910
是  昆廷
Yes, Quentin.

1694
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:00,210
我要处理的麻烦在哪
Show me my loose ends.

1695
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:02,110
节目一开始
Once the show's going,

1696
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:04,010
就等我命令执行击杀
execute the kill order on my command.

1697
01:32:04,010 --> 01:32:05,140
-收到  -好
- Copy. - All right.

1698
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:06,360
节目开始
Start the show.

1699
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:10,340
我们来拯救世界吧  各位
Let's save the world, people.

1700
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:14,580
我不喜欢这情况  绝对有问题
I don't like this. Something's definitely up.

1701
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:18,650
你现在是蛛友了  "蜘蛛侠的朋友"
You're an FOS now. "Friend of Spider-Man."

1702
01:32:18,690 --> 01:32:21,180
你得记住  保持冷静
And you have to remember, just stay calm.

1703
01:32:25,350 --> 01:32:26,580
内德  那看上去不妙
Ned, that doesn't look good.

1704
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:29,230
但那是假的  所以不必担心
But it's fake, so, there's nothing to worry about.

1705
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:32,290
孩子们进入击杀区了
And the kids are in the kill zone.

1706
01:32:33,230 --> 01:32:34,480
干得好  古特曼
Great work, Guterman.

1707
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:39,450
-干什么  -我是哈皮  哈皮·霍根
- What? - Happy here. Happy Hogan here.

1708
01:32:39,450 --> 01:32:40,590
我知道  你有什么事
I know. What do you want?

1709
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,550
斯塔克先生那边在整理东西
Over at Mr. Stark's, going through his belongings.

1710
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:44,870
你似乎留下了一块冲浪板
Apparently there was a surfboard you left behind.

1711
01:32:44,870 --> 01:32:46,130
-什么  -那边的人说
- What? - People over there said

1712
01:32:46,130 --> 01:32:47,550
尼克·弗瑞不像冲浪的人
they didn't think Nick Fury was a surfer,

1713
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:48,740
但我说"人不可貌相"
but I said, "Appearances can be deceiving."

1714
01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:51,950
不是我的  永远别再打这个号码了
It's not mine. And don't ever call this number again.

1715
01:32:57,210 --> 01:32:59,920
{\an8}{\pos(85.6,201.066)}英国  多赛特海岸

1716
01:33:00,570 --> 01:33:02,710
好  弗瑞听懂暗语了
Okay. Fury's got the coded message.

1717
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:04,940
-你的朋友在塔桥上  -好
- Your friends are at the Tower Bridge. - Okay.

1718
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:06,900
你朋友说是伦敦桥  但我还是猜出来了
Your boy called it London Bridge, but I figured it out.

1719
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,350
-我去接他们  好吗  -好
- I'm gonna go scoop them up, okay? - Yeah.

1720
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:10,410
-我们快到了  -是啊
- We're close. - We're close.

1721
01:33:10,410 --> 01:33:11,850
-战衣怎么样了  -快好了
- How's the suit coming? - Almost done.

1722
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:12,990
-很好  -等等
- Good. - Wait, wait.

1723
01:33:12,990 --> 01:33:15,820
你走之前  如果我出事了
Before you go, if something happens to me,

1724
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:17,470
你可以把这个给MJ吗
could you please give this to MJ?

1725
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:20,010
你能安全回来的  到时你自己给她
You are gonna make it back. You'll give it to her yourself.

1726
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:21,390
-你行的  -我行的
- Okay? You got this. - I got this.

1727
01:33:21,390 --> 01:33:24,320
-跟我说一遍  -他们用的是幻景科技
- Walk me through it. - I know it's illusion tech, right?

1728
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,360
我只需要进入幻景内部
All I do is get on the inside of the illusion,

1729
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:27,410
我就能击垮它
then I can take it down,

1730
01:33:27,410 --> 01:33:28,970
找到他  而他只是个人
find him, and he's just a guy.

1731
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:30,510
我可以把伊迪丝夺回来
So, I can take EDITH right back.

1732
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:32,830
好  但上次  你被火车撞了
Right, but last time, you got hit by a train.

1733
01:33:33,330 --> 01:33:35,600
是的  但这次
True, but this time...

1734
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,040
我怎么解释呢
How do I explain this?

1735
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:39,220
我有种第六感
I have a sixth sense.

1736
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:40,370
彼得一激灵
The Peter-tingle.

1737
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:42,740
你是说那个吧
That's what you're talking about, right?

1738
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:43,900
但现在不灵了
It's not working, though.

1739
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:46,000
我听说现在不灵了  是吧
I heard it wasn't working right now. Is it?

1740
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:46,780
灵的
It is working.

1741
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:48,260
-我不知道灵不灵...  -好
- I don't know if it's working... - Good.

1742
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:50,300
好  你有彼得一激灵  这就是你的计划
Okay. You got the Peter-tingle. That's the plan.

1743
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:51,540
我去接你的朋友
I'm gonna go get your friends.

1744
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:53,410
你让你的彼得一激灵重新上线
You get that Peter-tingle back online.

1745
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,530
我行的
I got this. I got this.

1746
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:10,790
闪电开始
Cue the lightning.

1747
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,260
闪电开始
Cuing lightning.

1748
01:34:17,730 --> 01:34:19,520
先生  上面还安全吗
Sir, is it still safe on the top,

1749
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,910
还是我们该下来
or should we all come down?

1750
01:34:21,970 --> 01:34:22,650
天啊
Oh, my.

1751
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:26,050
大巴司机怎么说
What did the bus driver say?

1752
01:34:26,050 --> 01:34:27,500
大巴司机不见了
Bus driver's gone.

1753
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,200
-什么  -去哪了
- What? - Where?

1754
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:32,020
没事的  戴尔老师和我能控制局面
It's okay. Mr. Dell and I have it under control!

1755
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:33,950
不  别把我拉进来
No. Don't drag me into this.

1756
01:34:33,950 --> 01:34:35,820
我已经尽力了  朱利亚斯
I'm doing my best, Julius!

1757
01:34:36,590 --> 01:34:38,670
-听着  -又是巫术
- Look... - Oh, the witches are back.

1758
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:40,890
天啊  快下车
Oh, my God, get off the bus!

1759
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:48,330
好  跟我来  孩子们
Okay, follow me, kids.

1760
01:34:51,390 --> 01:34:52,440
来  快走
Come on, let's go!

1761
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:08,410
这才是复仇者级别的威胁呢
Now, that is an Avengers-level threat.

1762
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:26,560
这边走
This way. This way!

1763
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:28,490
-好  -天啊
- Okay. Okay. - Oh, my God!

1764
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:30,110
-弗拉士  -跟着手走
- Flash! - Follow that hand.

1765
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:31,760
这边走  跟我来
This way. Follow me.

1766
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:33,520
这都不是真的
It's not real, it's not real!

1767
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,160
我看可挺真的
Well, it looks pretty real to me!

1768
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:36,510
跟我来  孩子们
Follow me, kids!

1769
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:39,880
地  风  火  水  不
Earth, wind, fire, water. Oh, no.

1770
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,920
他们合体了  就像超能战士
They joined forces like the Power Rangers.

1771
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:43,840
-那是战神金刚  -什么
- You're thinking of Voltron. - Who?

1772
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,710
你想的是战神金刚
Voltron! You're thinking of Voltron!

1773
01:35:45,790 --> 01:35:47,390
看  是神秘客
Hey, look, it's Mysterio!

1774
01:35:47,390 --> 01:35:48,660
他会救我们的
He's gonna save us!

1775
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:53,870
等等  如果神秘客知道我们知道了
Wait, if Mysterio knows we know...

1776
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:56,180
-我们就危险了  -对  他们也是
- Then we're in danger. - Yeah, and so are they.

1777
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:57,010
我们走吧
We should go.

1778
01:35:58,930 --> 01:36:00,440
灭了那巫术
Kill that witch! Ba-bow!

1779
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:04,510
这是为了我家人
This is for my family!

1780
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:07,660
你该去安全的地方  弗瑞
You should get somewhere safe, Fury.

1781
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:09,650
我觉得这事不会有好结局的
I don't see this ending well.

00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,270
-快点  -我不明白
- Let's go. - But I don't understand.

127
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,010
这是给我的吗  哈皮  哈皮  等等
Is it for me? Happy. Happy, wait.

128
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,970
这太疯狂了  太疯狂了
This is insane. Insane.

129
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,870
看这个啊  看看这眼睛
Look at this thing. Look. Look at the eyes.

130
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,270
-这是我人生最棒的一天  -快点换吧
- The greatest day of my life. - Let's go. Come on.

131
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,890
好了  那是美国队长  钢铁侠  黑寡妇
Okay, there's Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow.

132
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,390
-那个新来的是谁  -内衣宝宝
- Who's that new guy? - Underoos!

133
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,320
叫我呢  我得走了
Oh, that's me. I gotta go. I gotta go.

134
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,300
大家好
Hey, everyone.

135
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,100
好吧  刚刚太疯狂了
Okay, so the craziest thing just happened.

136
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,400
我跟美国队长打了一架
I just had a fight with Captain America.

137
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,680
我偷了他的盾  还拿盾丢他
I stole his shield. I threw it at him--

138
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,320
搞什么  他变大了  我得走了  等等
What the hell? He's big now. I gotta go. Hang on.

139
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,310
简直太赞了
It was the most amazing thing that ever happened!

140
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,680
斯塔克先生喊  "内衣宝宝"
Mr. Stark was like, "Hey, underoos!"

141
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,760
我就一个翻身偷了美队的盾
I flipped in and stole Cap's shield.

142
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,170
我还说  "大家好啊"
I was like, "What's up, everybody?"

143
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,080
然后  等一下
And then-- hey, just a second!

144
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,090
来了
Coming!

145
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,120
墙不太隔音
We have thin walls here.

146
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,610
你干什么呢  做视频日志吗
What are you doing, a little video diary?

147
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,210
-是啊  -没事
- Yeah. - It's all right.

148
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,870
-换了我也会的  -我叫他别了
- I'd do the same thing. - I told him not to.

149
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,890
他什么都拍  我会抹掉芯片的
He was filming everything. I'm gonna wipe the chip.

150
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,590
知道吗  我们反正也该拍段视频
You know what? We should make an alibi video

151
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,180
当托辞骗你婶婶  准备好了吗
for your aunt anyway. You ready?

152
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,820
-托辞  -拍了吗
- An alibi? - We rolling?

153
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,980
-好啊  -到镜头里来
- Sure. - Get in the frame.

154
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,680
好了
Okay.

155
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,150
梅  你好吗
Hey, May. How you doing?

156
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,890
你穿着什么呢  希望是布料少的
What are you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.

157
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,350
彼得  这么说不太好
Peter, that's inappropriate.

158
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,110
重来吧  你可以剪辑一下
Let's start over. You can edit it.

159
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,430
三  二  一  你好啊  梅
Three, two, one. Hey, may.

160
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,010
天呐  我想告诉你
My gosh, I wanted to tell you

161
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,050
你侄子这周末在斯塔克实习基地
what an incredible job your nephew did this weekend

162
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,630
表现得太出色了
at the Stark internship retreat.

163
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,590
大家都交口称赞
Everyone was impressed.

164
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,110
拜托
Come on!

165
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,240
并道啊  抱歉
It's a freaking merge. Sorry.

166
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,890
谁叫你不走皇后大道
Because you're not on Queens Boulevard.

167
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,480
哈皮本希望
See, Happy is hoping

168
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,120
能升职到资产管理部
to get bumped up to asset management.

169
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,820
他本是安保主管  再之前是个司机
He was forehead of security, before that he was a driver.

170
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,270
那是私人谈话
That was a private conversation.

171
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,750
我不喜欢拿这事开玩笑  很难启齿的
I don't like joking about this. It was hard to talk about that.

172
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,790
说真的  他是不是拼命打呼噜来着
No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?

173
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,410
我们到了  到家了
Here we are. End of the line.

174
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,680
哈皮  能让我们单独待会儿吗
Happy, can you give us a moment?

175
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,470
你要我下车吗
You want me to leave the car?

176
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,220
你去把彼得的箱子从后备箱拿出来吧
Why don't you grab Peter's case out of the trunk.

177
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,960
我能留下战衣吗
I can keep the suit?

178
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,840
是的  我们刚刚不正说呢嘛
Yes, we were just talking about it.

179
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,250
但是  帮个忙
Do me a favor, though.

180
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,830
哈皮算是你的负责人
Happy's kind of your point guy on this.

181
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,980
别给他太多压力  别干蠢事
Don't stress him out. Don't do anything stupid.

182
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,620
我看过他的心电图
I've seen his cardiogram.

183
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,530
-好吗  -好
- All right? - Yes.

184
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,320
别做我会做的事
Don't do anything I would do,

185
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,210
更不要做我不会做的事
and definitely don't do anything I wouldn't do.

186
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,590
这之间有一小块灰色区域  就是你的活动范围
There's a little gray area in there. And that's where you operate.

187
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,870
那么我是个复仇者了吗
Wait, does that mean I'm an avenger?

188
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,800
不是
No.

189
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,170
-这个吗  -七楼
- This it? - Seventh floor.

190
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,850
我拿上去吧  不劳您了
I can take that up. You don't have to take it.

191
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,570
-你自己拿啊  -嗯  我自己拿吧
- You're gonna take it? - Yeah, I can take that.

192
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,530
谢谢
Thank you.

193
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,420

So when's our next--?

194
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,310
再什么时候去"实习"
When's our next "retreat," you know?

195
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,510
下次任务吗
What, next mission?

196
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,940
对  任务  今后的任务
Yeah, the mission. The missions.

197
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,120
-我们会联络你的  -你有我的号码吗
- We'll call you. - Do you have my numbers?

198
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,730
不  就是会通知你的
No, I mean, we'll call you.

199
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,880
就是有人会打给你的  好吗
Like, someone will call you. All right?

200
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,720
-你团队的人  -那好
- From your team. - Okay. All right.

201
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,780
不是抱你  我就是替你开车门
That's not a hug. I'm just grabbing the door for you.

202
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,610
我们还没那么好呢
We're not there yet.

203
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,070

加入我  我们一起
Join me, and together

219
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,410
建造我的新乐高死星
we'll build my new Llego Death Star.

220
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,370
-什么  -太没劲了
- What? - So lame.

221
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,980
不会吧  太棒了  多少块的
No way. That's awesome. How many pieces?

222
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,760
Three thousand eight hundred and three.

223
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,720
-不可思议  -是啊
- That's insane. - I know.

224
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,250
你想今晚做吗
You want to build it tonight?

225
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,190
今晚不行  我得去斯塔克...
No, I can't tonight. I've got the Stark--

226
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,130
-斯塔克实习  -是啊
- Stark internship. - Yeah, exactly.

227
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,450
总得去做实习
Always got that internship.

228
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,440
是啊  希望
Yeah, well, hopefully,

229
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,310
很快就真能在那儿谋个职了
soon it'll lead to a real job with them.

230
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,370
-那就太棒了  -是吧
- That would be so sweet. - Right?

231
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,710
他会说  "表格做得真好  彼得
He'd be all, "Good job on those spreadsheets, Peter.

232
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,840
给你枚金币"
Here's a gold coin."

233
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,010
我根本不懂工作是什么样的
I don't know how jobs work.

234
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,510
就是这样的
That's exactly how they work.

235
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,650
我会在我家把死星的大体结构搭好
I'll knock out the basic bones of the Death Star at my place.

236
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,760
然后再去你家
I'll come by afterwards.

237
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,540
主要的难点是底座
For the most part, the difficult thing is the base of it.

238
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,200
上部至多两小时就能做好
The top half we can knock out in two hours, tops.

239
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,660
那好啊
That'd be great.

240
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,090
好了  我们如何计算
Okay, so how do we calculate

241
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,200
A点和B点之间的线性加速度
linear acceleration between points a and b?

242
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,120
弗拉士
Flash.

243
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,190
角正弦
It's the product of sine of the angle

244
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,670
乘重力除质量
and gravity divided by the mass.

245
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,320
不对  彼得
Nope. Peter.

246
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,050
还在听吗
You still with us?

247
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,820
在听  在听
Yeah, yeah.

248
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,770
质量抵消了  就是重力乘正弦
Mass cancels out, so it's just gravity times sine.

249
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,990
对  瞧  弗拉士  如果答错
Right. See, Flash, being the fastest

250
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,290
最快也未必是最好的
isn't always the best if you are wrong.

251
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,550
你死定了
You're dead.

252
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,510
今天我们要讨论丹麦物理学家尼尔斯·玻尔
Today we're talking about Danish physicist Niels Bohr,

253
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:48,780
{\an8}{\pos(174.6,92.8)}蛛网液

254
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,490
{\an8}{\pos(174.6,92.8)}蛛网液

255
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,450
但相信我  他发现的
but trust me, there's nothing bohr-ing

256
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,030
量子理论  可绝对不无聊
about his discoveries regarding quantum theory.

257
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,180
{\an8}返校节

258
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,610
-丽兹换新上衣了吗  -没有
- Did Liz get a new top? - No.

259
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,740
这件我们见过  只是没配过这条裙子
We've seen that before, but never with that skirt.

260
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,210
丽兹
Liz, hey.

261
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,810
真不错
That looks so good.

262
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,600
我们还是别再盯着看了  否则要像变态了
We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy, though.

263
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,500
已经变态了  你俩真可悲
Too late. You guys are losers.

264
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,230
那为什么跟我们坐一起
Well, then why do you sit with us?

265
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,760
因为我没有朋友
Because I don't have any friends.

266

267
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,810
下一问题
Let's move to the next question.

268
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,900
最重的自然元素是什么
What is the heaviest naturally-occurring element?

269
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,010
氢是最轻的
Hydrogen's the lightest.

270
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,960
但那不是问题  好吧
That's not the question. Okay. Yeah.

271
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,170
铀
Uranium.

272
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,420
正确  谢谢  亚伯拉罕

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,260
好吧
Okay.

420
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,340
穿上点衣服吧
Maybe put on some clothes.

421
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,670
-她还不知道吗  -谁都不知道
- She doesn't know? - Nobody knows.

422
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,160
斯塔克先生知道  因为他给我做了战衣
I mean, Mr. Stark knows because he made my suit.

423
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,980
但没别人了
But that's it.

424
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,480
那是托尼·斯塔克做的  你是复仇者吗
Tony Stark made you that? Are you an Avenger?

425
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,100
是啊  差不多吧
Yeah, basically.

426
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,130
-天呐  -你不能告诉任何人
- Oh, geez. - You can't tell anybody about this.

427
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,430
你得保密
You gotta keep it a secret.

428
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,230
-秘密  为什么  -你知道她的
- Secret? Why? - You know what she's like.

429
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,930
她要是知道我每晚都被人追杀
If she finds out people try and kill me every single night,

430
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,620
她就不会允许我再做下去了
she's not gonna let me do this anymore.

431
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,810
拜托了  内德
Come on, Ned, please.

432
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,650
好吧
Okay, okay, okay.

433
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,250
我跟你说实话
I'll level with you.

434
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,910
我觉得我保不了密
I don't think I can't keep this a secret.

435
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,190
这是我遇到过的最棒的事
It's the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.

436
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,530
内德  梅绝不能知道
Ned, May cannot know.

437
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,280
我现在不能让她那样担心
I cannot do that to her right now.

438
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,440
知道吗
You know?

439
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,750
她经受了那么多事  我...
I mean, everything that's happened with her, I--

440
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,490
求你

441
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,570
-好吧  -发誓  好吗

-谢谢  -嗯
- Thank you. - Yeah.

444
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,330
真不敢相信
I can't believe this is happening now.

445
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,530
-我能试试战衣吗  -不能
- Can I try the suit on? - No.

446
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,590
它是什么原理  磁铁吗
How's it work? Is it magnets?

447
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,650
那些线你怎么射出来的
How do you shoot the strings?

448
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,070
-明天到学校跟你讲  好吗  -太好了
- I'm gonna tell you about this at school tomorrow, okay? -  Great.

449
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,830
好吧  等一下
Okay, well, wait, then.

450
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,120
你怎么同时做这个和斯塔克的实习
How do you do this and the Stark internship?

451
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,330
这就是斯塔克的实习
This is the Stark internship.

452
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,720
快走吧
Just get out of here.

453
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,270
怎么了
What's the matter?

454
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,560
你不是喜欢肉沙拉吗
Thought you loved larb.

455
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,480
太腻了吗
It's too larby?

456
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,050
不够腻
Not larby enough.

457
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,580
你还要我说几次"腻"
How many times do I have to say "larb" before...

458
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,460
才肯跟我说话
You talk to me?

459
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,210
你知道我爱腻
You know I larb you.

460
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,160
我就是压力大  实习让我好累
I'm just stressed. The internship, and I'm tired.

461
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,500
很忙碌
A lot of work.

462
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,030
斯塔克的实习
The Stark internship.

463
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,730
跟你说  我可不怎么喜欢那个托尼·斯塔克
I have to tell you, not a fan of that Tony Stark.

464
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,010
你总是一心多用  他搞得你心神不宁
You're distracted all the time. He's got you in your head.

465
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,880
深受喜爱的皇后区达尔摩三明治店
...the beloved Queens institution Delmar Sandwiches

466
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:57,910
{\an8}他都叫你做什么
What does he have you doing?

467
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,280
在今晚早些时候的一场爆炸中被毁
was destroyed in an explosion earlier tonight

468
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,440
{\an8}你得相信直觉
You need to use your instincts.

469
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,250
爆炸起因是一场被挫败的自动提款机抢劫
after an ATM robbery was thwarted

470
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,030
而见义勇为的正是皇后区本地的犯罪终结者
by Queens' own colorful local crime stopper,

471
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,070
{\an8}怎么了
What?

472
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,200
蜘蛛侠
The Spider-man.

473
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,840
蜘蛛侠在阻止他们抢劫的过程中
As the Spider-man attempted to foil their heist,

474
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,540
一股强大的冲击波被触发
a powerful blast was set off,

475
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,850
结果切碎了街对面的小店
slicing through the bodega across the street.

476
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,030
奇迹的是  没人受伤
Miraculously, no one was harmed.

477
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,020
你要是看到了这样的事
If you spot something like that happening,

478
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,800
立刻调头就跑
you turn and you run the other way.

479
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,060
嗯嗯  当然了
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.

480
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,710
离我们就六个街区
Six blocks away from us.

481
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,480

485
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,590
请你们的
It's on the house.

486
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,400
谢谢
Thanks.

487
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,730
他真好心
That's nice of him.

488
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,590
我觉得他喜欢腻
I think he larbs you.

489
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,410
你被一只蜘蛛咬了
You got bit by a spider?

490
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,600
能让它咬咬我吗
Can it bite me?

491
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,710
大概挺疼的吧
Well, it probably would've hurt, right?

492
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,650
算了  就算真疼  我也忍了
Whatever. Even if it did hurt, I'd let it bite me.

493
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,610
或许吧  到底多疼
Maybe. How much did it hurt?

494
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,030
那只蜘蛛死了  内德
The spider's dead, Ned.

495
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,170
你当时在场
You were here?

496
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,390
是啊
Yeah.

497
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,100
你可能会没命呢
You could've died.

498
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,100
你下蛋吗
Do you lay eggs?

499

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,100
不能  内德
No, Ned.

503

How far can you shoot your webs?

505

没试过  闭嘴
It's unknown. Shut up.

506
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,560
开始管理...
--to begin regulating...

507
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,120
我要是你  就站在一栋建筑边缘
If I was you, I would stand on the edge of a building

508
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,960
-尽量往远了射  -闭嘴啦  内德

指挥另一个人行动的人

530
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,490
比如  如果你困在了火场里

我可以告诉你该去哪

我可以做你的技术支援
Cause, I could be your guy in the chair.

534

00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,980
你们在油管上看到银行的监控录像了吗

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,100
你都不知道他长什么样
You don't know what he looks like.

547
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,160
要是他严重烧伤了呢
What if he's seriously burned?

548
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:02,070
我不会在乎  我还是会爱他的为人
I wouldn't care. I'd still love him for the person he is inside.

549
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,350
彼得认识蜘蛛侠
Peter knows Spider-man.

00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,570
但我不该说出来的
Yeah, well, I'm not really supposed to talk about it.

557
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,970
太赞了  这样吧
Well, that's awesome. Hey, you know what?

558
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:30,020
或许你该请他参加丽兹的派对  是吧

00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,440
我知道彼得反正也忙得没时间参加派对

带我飞了好高  然后又把我丢了下来

你怎么找到我的

你在我的战衣上装了追踪器吗

688
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,960
这种事不值得他们出手

总之  斯塔克先生  您不必大老远赶来的

我迎战美国队长时  你可不是这么想的

考虑大学的事永远不嫌早
You know, it's never too early to start thinking about college.

是啊  学校旅行  没事的
Yeah, it's just a school trip. It's nothing.

879
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:00,640
哈皮  我得说
Look, Happy, I gotta say,

880
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,920
你这样不经我允许追踪我
you tracking me without permission

881
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,000
完全侵犯了我的隐私
is a complete violation of my privacy.

882
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,230
-那不一样  -什么不一样
- That's different. - What's different?

883
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,670
没什么  听着  只是学术竞赛而已
Nothing. Look, it's just the academic decathlon.

884
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:09,940
不是什么大事
It's no big deal.

885
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:12,260
是不是大事我说了算
I'll decide if it's no big deal.

886
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:15,510
听起来的确不是大事
Sounds like it's no big deal,

887
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:17,110
但你记住  我在看着你
but remember, I'm watching you.

888
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,520
{\an8}美国学术竞赛

889
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,130
-大家跟紧了  -对

00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:33,290
你逗我吗  这地方好大
You kidding me? This place is huge.

891
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,960
-我见过更大的  -里面有只鸟
- I've seen bigger. - There's a bird in here.

892
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:37,750

You brought your laptop, right?

893
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:39,390
干什么
Why?

894
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:40,500
{\an8}请勿打扰

895
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,170
{\an8}{\pos(244.2,208)}读取数据集

896
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,080
彼得
Peter,

897
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:51,230
为什么要去掉你战衣上的追踪器
why are we removing the tracker from your suit?

898
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:55,200
因为我要在这些人再次转移前
Because I gotta follow these guys to their boss

899
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,670
跟着他们找到他们的老大
before they move again

900
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,180
而且我不想让斯塔克先生知道
and I don't really want Mr. Stark to know about it.

901
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,710
你要对钢铁侠撒谎
So you're lying to Iron Man now?

902
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,080
不  不是撒谎
No, I'm not lying.

903
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,560
他只是还不知道我的能耐
He just doesn't really get what I can do yet.

904
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:11,800
好了
Gotcha.

905
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,770
好了  哈皮  追踪台灯去吧
All right, Happy, enjoy tracking this lamp.

906
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,060
这里还有一堆其他的子系统
There's a ton of other subsystems in here.

907
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,610
但都被辅助轮协议禁用了
But they're all disabled by the Training Wheels Protocol.

908
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:27,760
什么
What?

909
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,570
辅助轮协议
"Training Wheels Protocol"?

910
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,460
关掉
Turn it off.

911
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,160
这样不好吧
I don't think that's a good idea.

912
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:34,990
禁用大概是有原因的
I mean, they're probably blocked for a reason.

913
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,540
拜托  我不需要辅助轮
Come on, man, I don't need training wheels.

914
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:40,020
我受够了他一直把我当小孩
I'm sick of him treating me like a kid all the time.

915
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,210
-太过分了  -但你确实是小孩
- It's not cool. - But you are a kid.

916
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,590
是啊  一个能徒手拦下大巴的小孩
Yeah, a kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands.

917
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,810
彼得  我觉得这样做不好
Peter, I just don't think this is a great idea.

918
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:48,650
要是是违法的怎么办
I mean, what if this is illegal?

919
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:49,670
求你了
Look, please.

920
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,610

This is my chance to prove myself.

我能行的  内德  来吧
I can handle it. Ned, come on.

922
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,430
我真觉得这样不好
I really don't think this is a good idea.

923
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:56,960
技术支援啊
The guy in the chair.

924
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,180

925
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:15,580
发光物是证据  保管好  好吗
The glowy thing, it's evidence. Keep it safe, all right?

- Hey, Liz. - Perfect timing.

929
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:27,440

Hey, Peter.

932
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,100
我正要去商务中心学习
I was-- I was gonna go study in the business center.

933
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,040
彼得  你不用学习了
Peter, you don't need to study.

934
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,790
你是我认识的最聪明的人
You're, like, the smartest guy I've ever met.

935
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:45,120
而且  比赛前一天
And besides, a rebellious group activity

936
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,300
集体进行反叛活动  有助于鼓舞士气
the day before competition is good for morale.

937
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,740
我在TED演讲里读到的

966
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,680
战衣姐姐  他们在干什么
Suit lady, what are they doing?

不敢相信他们还在清理三曲翼总部
Can't believe they're still cleaning the Triskelion mess.

你似乎对你的射网器设置很不熟悉
You seem to be unfamiliar with your web-shooter settings.

1005

1018
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,230
好了  我上来了
All right, coming up.

1019

1023
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,090
启动所有系统
Activating all systems.

1024
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,020
我的头啊
My head.

1025
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,140
你似乎轻微脑震荡了
You appear to have a mild concussion.

1026
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:56,750
我现在在哪
So where am I right now?

1027
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,640
我不确定
I'm not sure.

1028
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:01,520
集装箱壁隔绝了我的传感器
The container walls are hindering my sensors.

1029
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:03,840
等等
Wait a minute.

1030
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,600
他们肯定是劫持了卡车
They must have hijacked the truck

1031
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,310
把我带回了他们的邪恶老巢
and taken me to their evil lair.

1032
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:09,300
好吧  战衣姐姐
Okay, Suit Lady,

1033
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:11,400

你在东海岸最安全的设施内

1039

战衣姐姐  我觉得不该
Suit Lady, I kind of feel bad

1043
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,290
一直喊你"战衣姐姐"  知道吗
calling you "Suit Lady," you know?

1044
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,750
我或许该给你起个名字
I think I should probably give you a name...

1045
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,610
比如丽兹  不不
Like Liz. No, no, no.

1046
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:50,600
天呐  那太怪了
God, that's-- that's weird.

1047
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,400
凯伦呢
What about Karen?

1048
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,770
如果你想  可以喊我凯伦
You can call me Karen if you would like.

1049
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:58,050
凯伦  战衣还有什么功能
Karen, what else can this suit do?

1050

什么
What?

1051
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,800
或许我们该运行一下复习课程

-弹跳蛛网  -弹跳蛛网

1053
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,540
酷
Cool.

1055
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:11,730
-蛛网手雷  -蛛网手雷

1056
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,420
我该告诉丽兹我是蜘蛛侠吗
Should I tell Liz that I'm Spider-man?

1057
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,970
丽兹是谁
Who is Liz?

1058
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:20,070

1059
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:22,750
她最棒了  她好赞
She's the best. She's awesome.

1060
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,770
她是我们学校的一个姑娘
She's just a girl who goes to my school.

1061
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,590
而且
And, uh...

1062
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:28,500
我真的很想告诉她
Yeah, I just-- I really want to tell her,

1063
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,780
但这有点怪怪的
but it's kind of weird, you know?

1064
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,880
"我是蜘蛛侠"
"I'm-- I'm Spider-man."

1065
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,430
这有什么奇怪的
What's weird about that?

1066
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:37,600
要是她以为我会是托尼·斯塔克那样的人呢
What if she's expecting someone like Tony Stark?

1067
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,790
等她看到是我  得多失望啊
Imagine how disappointed she'd be when she sees me.

1068
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:41,660
如果我是她
Well, if I were her,

1069
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,570
我就一点不会失望
I wouldn't be disappointed at all.

1073
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,040
-37分钟  -什么
- Thirty-seven minutes. - What?

1074
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,120
37分钟  这不可能
Thirty-seven minutes? That's insane.

1075
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,370
我再也受不了了
I cannot take this anymore.

1076
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,330

这个好赞
That's awesome.

1081

这就像那个发光物
It's like the glowy thing.

1082
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,450
那个发光物是爆炸性齐塔瑞能量核
That glowy thing is an explosive Chitauri energy core.

1083
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,910
你是说我们一直到处带着枚炸弹
You mean, we've been carrying around a bomb?

1084
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:19,690
得有辐射才会让它
It would require radiation to transform it

1085

进入易爆状态

1164
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:13,520
125秒后将发生致命失效

1165
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:14,480

1166
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,620
意外动作导致了情况加速恶化

启动侦查无人机

1169
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,080
那个一直在我胸前吗  太赞了

1170
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,820
寻找最佳进入口

1171
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:32,070
前往西南窗口

-你为什么犹豫不前  -没事

我就是从没爬过这么高

而且你还没有重装你的降落伞
You have also not reinstalled your parachute,

1181
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,520
如果从这么高掉下去  很可能会致命
so a fall from this height would most likely be lethal.

1182
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,140
太好了
Perfect.

1183
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:16,900
天呐
Oh, my god.

1184
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:20,040
它怎么不碎
Why is it not breaking?

1185
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,330
是10厘米厚的防弹玻璃
It's four-inch ballistic glass.

1186
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:23,150
你得制造更大的动量
You'll have to create more momentum.

但没有车上的新材料
but without any new materials from that truck...

1227
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,070
是啊  该死
Yeah, damn it.

1228
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,530
我们还有足够物料完成盖根的订单吧
We still have enough to do the Gargan deal though, right?

1229
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:28,890
嗯  然后就没了

1230
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:36,160
或许我该做高空密封装置了
Maybe it is time that I built the high-altitude seal.

1231

八年了  条子毫无动静

斯塔克塔上那些穿万圣节服装的白痴

1235
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,910
也没来找过事
up there in Stark tower.

1236
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,150
然后突然
And then all of a sudden,

1237
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:52,900
冒出这么个穿红紧身衣的小混蛋
this little bastard in red tights shows up

1238
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:56,320
就以为自己能毁掉我所建立的一切
and he thinks he can tear down everything I've built.

1239
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,490
是吗
Really?

1240
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:02,380

到处是紫激光  还有烟

1254
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:38,070
太...紧张  就像邦·乔维演唱会
It was... tight, like a Bon Jovi concert.

1255
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:39,650
大家知道  我们活下来了
As you know, we made it out alive,

1256
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:41,070
这才是最重要的
and that's the important thing.

1257
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:44,220
我可受不了在学校出行期间有学生出事
I couldn't bear to lose a student on a school trip.

幸好  没人受重伤
Thankfully, no one was seriously injured,

1260
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:51,260
这要多谢蜘蛛侠

不行  哥们  那可不好

哥们  听着  我想明白了

翅膀男在偷损害控制的东西

1276
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,090
做成武器
that's how he builds the weapons.

01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:28,760
我只需要抓到他

或许你是想扮酷

1290
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:01,570
但听我一个冻了65年的人一句劝
But take it from a guy who's been frozen for 65 years,

真正想酷  就只能遵守规矩

我们都分得清对错

《彼得闯大祸》前情提要
Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch,

1482
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:33,040
我叫你别管这事
I tell you to stay away from this.

1483
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,980
但你黑进了价值几百万的战衣
Instead, you hacked a multimillion-dollar suit

1484
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,830
好偷偷背着我
so you could sneak around behind my back

1485
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:41,310
做我不让你做的事
doing the one thing I told you not to do.

1486
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:42,500
大家都没事吧
Is everyone okay?

1487
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:44,960

那些武器流通在外  我一直想尽办法告诉你
Those weapons were out there and I tried to tell you about it,

1490
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:54,110
但你不听
but you didn't listen.

1491
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:57,200
要是你肯听我的  这些事都不会发生
None of this would've happened if you had just listened to me.

1492
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,160
你要是你真在乎的话  就会亲自来了
If you even cared, you'd actually be here.

1493
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:05,630
我听了  孩子
I did listen, kid.

1494
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:07,700
你以为是谁把联调局叫来的
Who do you think called the FBI, huh?

1495
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:10,580
你知道我是唯一一个相信你的人吗
Do you know I was the only one who believed in you?

1496
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:12,630
其他人都说我疯了
Everyone else said I was crazy

1497
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:15,240
-招来个14岁的小孩  -我15
- to recruit a 14-year-old kid. - I'm 15.

1498
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,810
不  你把嘴闭严了  好吗
No. This is where you zip it, all right?

1499
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:18,090
大人说话别插嘴
The adult is talking.

1500
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:19,680
要是今晚有人死了怎么办
What if somebody had died tonight?

1501
01:21:19,730 --> 01:21:22,210
那可就不一样了  对吧  那是你的责任
Different story, right? 'Cause that's on you.

1502
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:23,880
要是你死了
And if you died,

1503
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,980
我会觉得责任在我
I feel like that's on me.

1504
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:28,390
我可不想良心不安
I don't need that on my conscience.

1505
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:29,640
-是啊  先生  我很抱歉  -是啊
- Yes, sir, I'm sorry. - Yes.

1506
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:30,190
对不起
I'm sorry.

1507
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,100
-对不起也没用  -我明白
- Sorry doesn't cut it. - I understand.

1508
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,220
我只是想像你一样
I just wanted to be like you.

1509
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:35,930
但我希望你比我强
And I wanted you to be better.

1510
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:38,870
好吧  这样不行
Okay, it's not working out.

1511
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:40,030
我得收回战衣
I'm gonna need the suit back.

1512

-快脱吧  -你不明白
- Let's have it. - You don't understand.

1515
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:48,450
这是我的一切  没有这套战衣我一无是处
This is all I have. I'm nothing without this suit.

1516
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,520
如果没有这套战衣你就一无是处
If you're nothing without this suit,

1517
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,270
那你就不配拥有它  好吗
then you shouldn't have it, okay?

1518
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:54,390
天哪  我口气跟我爸一样
God, I sound like my dad.

1519
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,920
我没别的衣服了
I don't have any other clothes.

1520

01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,200
彼得  你得告诉我到底怎么了

我只想要个严肃的答案
All I want is a serious answer.

146
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,380
好吧  说严肃的  我老爸有个理论

147
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,980
"和平就是比对方的棍子大"
"Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy."

那有自己的飞机
of having your own plane

194
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,160

if it departs before you arrive?

195

No. The Springs was actually the neighbourhood in East Hampton

200

-并不是春天的"春"  -是吗

我觉得还可以  而且定价过高了
I think it's a fair example. I think it's incredibly overpriced.

他们在唠叨我  我就答应了
They're haranguing me, so I'm gonna say yes.

反弹或吸收
Deflect it and absorb it.

209
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,670
-别传递给我  -你上机前
- Don't transmit it back to me. - I need you to sign this

210
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,020
-我需要你给这个签字  -你干吗非要赶我走
- before you get on the plane. - What are you trying to get rid of me for?

211
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,350
你有安排吗
What, you got plans?

212
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,040
-事实上  真有  -我不喜欢你有安排
- As a matter of fact, I do. - I don't like it when you have plans.

213
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,070
我生日这天是可以有安排的
I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday.

214

-今天是你生日吗  -嗯
- It's your birthday? - Yes.

215
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,230
我知道的  这就到了吗
I knew that. Already?

216
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,900
是的  多奇怪啊  跟去年是同一天
Yeah. Isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year.

217
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,310
-拿我的钱给自己买点好东西吧  -买了
- Get yourself something nice from me. - I already did.

218
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,980
-怎么样  -可好了

You did, sir.

224
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,020
我不得不抄穆赫兰道的捷径
I had to cut across Mulholland.

00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,090
你不尊重自己  所以我知道你不尊重我
You don't respect yourself, so I know you don't respect me.

240
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,200
-我尊重你  -我就是你的保姆
- I respect you. - I'm just your babysitter.

241
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,170
如果你需要换尿布了  谢谢
So, when you need your diaper changed... Thank you.

242
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,720
就告诉我  我去给你拿奶瓶  好吗
Let me know and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

243
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,140
加热下清酒  好吗
Heat up the sake, will you?

244
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,630
-多谢提醒我  -我不是说
- Thanks for reminding me. - No, I'm not talking...

245
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,500
我们不喝酒  我们在工作
We're not drinking. We're working right now.

246
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,830
-吃生鱼片一定要配清酒  -你根本就是
- You can't have sashimi without sake. - You are constitutionally

247
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,810
做不到负责任
incapable of being responsible.

248
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,120
不喝酒才不负责
It would be irresponsible not to drink.

249
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,150
不过是一杯睡前酒
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

250
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,380
热清酒
Hot sake?

251
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,230
好  来两杯  谢谢
Yes, two, please.

252
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,810
不  我不喝  我不要
No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.

253
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,180
我就这意思
That's what I'm talking about.

254
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,180
我早上起床  穿上军服
When I get up in the morning and I'm putting on my uniform,

255
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,290
知道我认得什么吗
you know what I recognise?

256
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,530
我在镜子里能看到
I see in that mirror that

257
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,450
每一个穿着这军服的人都会照应我
every person that's got this uniform on got my back!

258
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,820
知道吗  我跟你不一样  我不适合
Hey, you know what? I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

259
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,900
不  你不非得像我一样
No, no. You don't have to be like me!

260
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,310
但你远不止现在的你自己
But you're more than what you are.

261
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,380
抱歉  我现在有点无法集中精神
Can you excuse me if I'm a bit distracted here?

262
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,890
不  你现在不能不集中精神  听我说
No! You can't be distracted right now! Listen to me!

263
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,330
{\an8}{\pos(186,190)}阿富汗  巴格兰空军基地

264
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,060
将军
General.

265
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,530
欢迎  斯塔克先生
Welcome, Mr Stark.

266
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,980
我们很期待您的武器展示
We look forward to your weapons presentation.

267
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,940
谢谢
Thanks.

268
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,810
被恐惧和被尊敬  哪个更好
Is it better to be feared or respected?

269
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,140
要我说  两个都要算过分吗
I say, is it too much to ask for both?

270
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,750
因此  我谦卑地献上斯塔克工业
With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel

271
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,660
自由系列的旗舰产品
of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.

272
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,700
这是第一个融入了
It's the first missile system

273
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,810
我们的专利冲击科技的导弹系统
to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology.

274
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,890
人说最好的武器是不需要使用的武器
They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire.

275
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,920
我尊重地表示不同意
I respectfully disagree.

276
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,220
我更喜欢你只需要使用一次的武器
I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once.

277
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,500
我老爸就这么做  美国就这么做
That's how Dad did it. That's how America does it.

278
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,470
而且到目前一直挺成功
And it's worked out pretty well so far.

279
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,820
找个借口
Find an excuse

280
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,250
发射一次这玩意  我亲自担保
to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you

281
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,690
坏蛋再也不会想从洞里爬出来了
the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves.

282
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,700
供您参考  耶利哥
For your consideration, the Jericho.

283
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,290
每笔超过五亿的交易
I'll be throwing one of these in

284
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,840
我送一个这个
with every purchase of 500 million or more.

285
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,960
敬和平
To peace!

286
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,790
-托尼  -奥比  你怎么起来了
- Tony. - Obie, what are you doing up?

287
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,230
不清楚情况我睡不着  展示得怎么样
I couldn't sleep till I found out how it went. How'd it go?

288
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,610
很好  看来圣诞节要提前了
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas.

289
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,220
好样的  伙计  明天见了
Way to go, my boy! I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

290
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,440
你怎么没穿我送你的睡衣
Why aren't you wearing those pyjamas I got you?

291
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,000
晚安  托尼
Good night, Tony.

292
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,150
-托尼  -抱歉  这辆车是"欢乐马"
- Hey, Tony. - I'm sorry, this is the "Fun-vee."

293
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,020
"悍无聊马"在后面
The "Hum-drum-vee" Is back there.

294
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,980
-好样的  -基地见
- Nice job. - See you back at base.

295
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,640
我劝你别那么做
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

296
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,440
你对我做了什么
What the hell did you do to me?

297
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,560
我做了什么
What I did?

298
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,250
我做的事是救你命
What I did is to save your life.

299
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,750
我已经尽力移除了很多弹片  但还剩不少
I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left,

300
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,100
而且它们都在往你的房隔去
and it's headed into your atrial septum.

301
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,590
想看看吗
Here, want to see?

302
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,900
我留了纪念品  看看吧
I have a souvenir. Take a look.

303
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,800
我在我的村子里见过不少这样的伤
I've seen many wounds like that in my village.

304
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,320
我们称他们为将死行尸
We call them the walking dead

305
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,490
因为大概要一周
because it takes about a week

306
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,440
弹片才会进入重要器官
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

307
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,110
-这是什么  -那是块电磁铁
- What is this? - That is an electromagnet,

308
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,270
连在了汽车电池上
hooked up to a car battery,

309
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,980
它在阻止弹片进入你的心脏
and it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart.

310
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,900
没错  笑笑
That's right. Smile.

311
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,440
我们见过一次  在伯尔尼的一场科技大会上
We met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern.

312
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,830
-我不记得了  -当然了
- I don't remember. - No, you wouldn't.

313
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,890
如果我喝得那么醉  肯定站都站不直
If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand,

314
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,340
更别说就集成电路发表讲话了
much less give a lecture on integrated circuits.

315
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,460
我们在哪
Where are we?

316
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,730
快起来  起来
Come on, stand up. Stand up!

317
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,510
学我的样子做
Just do as I do.

318
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,580
把手举起来
Come on, put your hands up.

319
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,440
那是我的枪  他们怎么弄到的
Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?

320
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,690
你听懂了没  学我的样子做
Do you understand me? Do as I do.

321
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:53,640
他说"欢迎  托尼·斯塔克  美国历史上
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer

322
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,540
最著名的大屠杀犯"
in the history of America."

323
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,920
他很荣幸
He is honoured.

324
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,880
他要你给他建导弹
He wants you to build the missile.

325
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,840
你展示的那个耶利哥导弹
The Jericho missile that you demonstrated.

326
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,970
这个
This one.

327
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,350
我拒绝
I refuse.

328
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,940
托尼
Tony!

329
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,040
{\an8}斯塔克工业

330
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,300
他问你觉得怎么样
He wants to know what you think.

331
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,230
我觉得你有好多我的武器
I think you got a lot of my weapons.

332
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,770
他说他们有你需要
He says they have everything

333
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,270
拿来建造耶利哥的一切
you need to build the Jericho missile.

334
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,060
他要你列出材料清单
He wants you to make the list of materials.

335
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,950
他说要你立刻开始动手
He says for you to start working immediately,

336
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,070
你做好了  他就放了你
and when you're done, he will set you free.

337
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,630
-不  他不会的  -是啊
- No, he won't. - No, he won't.

338
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,780
他们肯定在找你  斯塔克
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.

339
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,330
但在这些山里  他们是找不到你的
But they will never find you in these mountains.

340
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,160
你刚刚看到一切
Look, what you just saw,

341
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,980
那就是你的遗产  斯塔克
that is your legacy, Stark.

342
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,920
你一生的心血  落在那些杀人犯手里
Your life's work, in the hands of those murderers.

343
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,520
你想这样死去吗
Is that how you want to go out?

344
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,500
这就是伟大的托尼·斯塔克的
Is this the last act of defiance

345
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,950
最后反抗吗
of the great Tony Stark?

346
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,080
还是说你要想想办法
Or are you going to do something about it?

347
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,220
我何必还要做点什么
Why should I do anything?

348
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,230
他们无论如何都会杀了你  杀了我
They're going to kill me, you, either way.

349
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,590
就算不  我大概也活不过一周
And if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week.

350
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,830
那么
Well, then,

351
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,100
这一周就对你至关重要了吧
this is a very important week for you, isn't it?

352
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,620
如果这里要做我的工作站
If this is going to be my work station,

353
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,410
我要灯火通明  这个竖好
I want it well-lit. I want these up.

354
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,950
我需要焊接工具  乙炔和丙烷的都行
I need welding gear. I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.

355
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,950
我需要焊接工作台
I need a soldering station.

356
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,360
头盔  护目镜
I need helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

357
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:09,230
我还要熔炼杯  两组精密工具
I would like a smelting cup. I need two sets of precision tools.

358
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,540
{\an8}斯塔克工业

359
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,540
-你说多少种语言  -好多种
- How many languages do you speak? - A lot.

360
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,700
但看来在这里还是不够用
But apparently, not enough for this place.

361
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,520
他们说阿拉伯语  乌尔都语
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

362
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,220
达里语  帕施图语
dari, Pashto,

363
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,230
蒙古语  波斯语  俄语
Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.

364
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,400
他们是什么人
Who are these people?

365
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,930
他们是你的忠实顾客  先生
They are your loyal customers, sir.

366
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,340
他们自称"十戒组织"
They call themselves the Ten Rings.

367
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,890
如果你告诉我你的计划
You know, we might be more productive

368
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,260
我们的动作可能会更快
if you include me in the planning process.

369
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,610
好吧  我们不需要这个
Okay, we don't need this.

370
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,480
那是什么
What is that?

371
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,300
钯  0.15克
That's palladium, 0.15 grammes.

372
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,710
我们需要至少1.6
We need at least 1.6,

373
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,740
你去把另外11个拆了吧
so why don't you go break down the other 11?

374
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,150
他在干什么
What's he doing?

375
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,290
干活儿
Working.

376
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,450
小心  我们只有一次机会
Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this.

377
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,550
放心  我手很稳
Relax. I have steady hands.

378
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,940
要不你怎么会还活着
Why do you think you're still alive?

379
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,580
-怎么称呼你  -我叫殷森
- What do I call you? - My name is Yinsen.

380
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,020
殷森  认识你很高兴
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

381
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,830
我也很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you, too.

382
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,700
那看上去不像耶利哥导弹
That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.

383
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,490
因为那是个迷你方舟反应堆
That's because it's a miniaturised arc reactor.

384
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,810
我家里有个大的给我的工厂供电
I got a big one powering my factory at home.

385

这应该足以阻止弹片进入我的心脏

那足以让你的心跳50辈子

或者让什么大玩意跑15分钟

-这是我们逃离的方法  -是什么

你是个拥有一切的人
So you're a man who has everything

403
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,760
却一无所有
and nothing.

404
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,870
看上去完全不像照片上的东西
It doesn't look anything like the picture.

405
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,580
或许是改装过了
Maybe it's been modified.

406
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,650
尾翼不对
The tail is wrong.

407
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,100
就是倒过来了
It's just backwards.

- What's up with the love-in? - Don't look at me.

537
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,380
我不知道他是想干什么
I don't know what he's up to.

538
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,720
-见到你真好  -我也是
- Good to see you. - Good to see you.

539
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,340
我没能跟爸爸说再见
I never got to say goodbye to Dad.

540
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,080
我没能跟我父亲说再见
I never got to say goodbye to my father.

541
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,110
我有些问题想问他
There's questions that I would have asked him.

542
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,680
我想问他对公司的作为怎么看
I would have asked him how he felt about what this company did.

543
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,120
他是否有过挣扎  有过怀疑
If he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts.

544
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,030
或许他就完全是
Or maybe he was every inch

545
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,640
新闻纪录片里的那个男人
the man we all remember from the newsreels.

546
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:19,510
我看到了年轻的美国人被杀
I saw young Americans killed

547
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:24,530
杀害他们的正是我为了维护他们而制造的武器
by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them.

548
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:27,260
我还看到
And I saw that I

549
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,450
我已经成为了
had become part of a system

550
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,040
不愿负担责任的系统的一员
that is comfortable with zero accountability.

551
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,220
-斯塔克先生  -本
- Mr Stark! - Hey, Ben.

552
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,140
你在那里经历了什么
What happened over there?

553
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:42,380
我开了眼界  我意识到我可以为
I had my eyes opened. I came to realise that I have more

554
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:46,810
这世界做更多  而不只是制造爆炸
to offer this world than just making things that blow up.

555
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,480
因此  即刻生效  我要关闭
And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down

556
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:53,420
斯塔克国际公司的武器生产部
the weapons manufacturing division of Stark lnternational

557
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,730
直到
until such a time

558
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,370
我决定好公司的未来
as I can decide what the future of the company will be.

559
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,260
-大家这下不愁  -决定好它的走向
- I think we're gonna be... -  What direction it should take,

560
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:01,800
-卖不出报纸了  -我能接受的
- selling a lot of newspapers. - one that l'm comfortable with

561
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:04,080
并且与国家最高利益
and is consistent with the highest good

562
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,620
一致的走向
for this country, as well.

563
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,040
我们应该记住的
What we should take away from this

564
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,370
是托尼回来了
is that Tony's back!

565
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,110
而且非常健康
And he's healthier than ever.

566
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,170
我们将进行内部探讨
We're going to have a little internal discussion

567
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,650
随后向大家通报
and we'll get back to you with the follow-up.

568
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,210
-他人呢  -在里面
- Where is he? - He's inside.

569
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:38,990
那...挺顺利嘛
Well, that... That went well.

570
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,430
我是在脑后放了个靶子吗
Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?

571
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,850
你的脑袋  那我的脑袋呢
Your head? What about my head?

572
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,410
你觉得明天股价
What do you think the over-under on the stock

573
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,030
会跌到什么程度
drop is gonna be tomorrow?

574
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,170
-乐观估计  40点  -至少
- Optimistically, 40 points. - At minimum.

575
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,500
是啊
Yep.

576
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:55,030
托尼  我们是武器制造商
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.

577
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,710
奥比  我不希望我们将来只留下杀伤数字
Obie, I just don't want a body count to be our only legacy.

578
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,840
这是我们的工作
That's what we do.

579
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,670
我们是铁商  我们制造武器
We're iron mongers. We make weapons.

580
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,620
大楼上是我的名字
It's my name on the side of the building.

581
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:04,500
我们的工作让世界不会陷入混乱
And what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.

582
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:05,960
我看到的可不是这样
Not based on what I saw.

583
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,630
我们做得不够好
We're not doing a good enough job.

584
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,850
我们可以做得更好  我们要做别的
We can do better. We're gonna do something else.

585
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:13,090
什么别的  你要我们做奶瓶吗
Like what? You want us to make baby bottles?

586
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:17,330
我认为我们该重新考虑方舟反应堆科技
I think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.

587
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:21,840
得了  方舟反应堆就是个噱头
Come on. The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

588
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:22,740
托尼  拜托
Tony, come on.

589
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,160
我们建这个是为了堵嬉皮士的嘴
We built that thing to shut the hippies up!

590
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:28,870
-成功了  -是啊  作为科学项目
- It works. - Yeah, as a science project.

591
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,300
方舟反应堆的效益性根本不好
The arc was never cost effective.

592
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,220
我们建造之前就知道了
We knew that before we built it.

593
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:35,440
方舟反应堆科技是个死胡同  是吧
Arc reactor technology, that's a dead end, right?

594
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:36,490
或许吧
Maybe.

595
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,880
是吧  我们在这方面多久没有突破了
Am I right? We haven't had a breakthrough in that in what?

596
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,660
-30年吗  -据说是的
- Thirty years. - That's what they say.

597
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:47,200
你的扑克脸能更糟点吗  告诉我  谁说的
Could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?

598
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:50,450
-别管了  给我看  -罗德还是派珀
- Never mind who told me. Show me. - It's Rhodey or Pepper.

599
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,450
-我要看  -好吧  是罗德
- I want to see it. - Okay, Rhodey.

600
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,040
-好吧  -行吗
- Okay. - Okay?

601
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:07,080
成功了
It works.

602
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,520
听我说  托尼  我们是一队的  懂吗
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team. Do you understand?

603
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:18,770
只要我们合力  没什么是做不到的
There's nothing we can't do if we stick together,

604
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,400
就像当年我和你父亲
like your father and I.

605
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:22,440
抱歉我没提前跟你商量
I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads-up, okay?

606
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:23,780
-但如果我说了  -托尼
- But if I had... - Tony.

607
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:27,200
托尼  别再干这种脱口而出的事了
Tony, no more of this "ready, fire, aim" business.

608
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:29,070
-明白吗  -那是老爸常说的话
- You understand me? - That was Dad's line.

609
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,690
你得让我来处理
You gotta let me handle this.

610
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,060
我们现在得玩另一套把戏了
We're gonna have to play a whole different kind of ball now.

611
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:37,110
我们要承受很大压力
We're going to have to take a lot of heat.

612
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,580
我要你保证  你会低调些
I want you to promise me that you're gonna lay low.

613
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:42,430
斯塔克工业
Stark lndustries!

614
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,590
我给你推荐条路  准备好了吗
I've got one recommendation! Ready? Ready?

615
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:46,730
卖卖卖
Sell, sell, sell!

616
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,980
弃船
Abandon ship!

617
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:52,450
兴登堡飞艇的事记得吗
Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?

618
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,620
我给大家看看
Let me show you

619
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:58,890
新斯塔克工业的商业计划
the new Stark lndustries business plan!

620
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:04,180
这就是一家不造武器的武器公司
Look, that's a weapons company that doesn't make weapons!

621
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,550
派珀  你的手有多大
Pepper. How big are your hands?

622
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:10,080
-什么  -你的手有多大
- What? - How big are your hands?

623
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:13,130
-我不懂这...  -下来  我需要你
- I don't understand why... - Get down here. I need you.

624
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,970
伸出来  给我看看你的手
Let's see them. Show me your hands.

625
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,120
给我看看
Let's see them.

626
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:30,040
好小  好精巧
They are small. Very petite, indeed.

627
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,870
我需要你帮个忙
I just need your help for a sec.

628
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,200
天呐  那就是维系你生命的东西吗
Oh, my God, is that the thing that's keeping you alive?

629
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:39,400
之前是  现在是古董了
It was. It is now an antique.

630
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,420
这个将在未来一段时间内维系我的生命
This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future.

631
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:43,950
我要换升级版的
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,

632
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,000
现在遭遇了点障碍
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

633
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:48,740
障碍  什么意思
Speed bump, what does that mean?

634
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:49,880
没事  就是个小问题
It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

635
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:53,560
这个装置下面有条暴露的电线
There's an exposed wire under this device.

636
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,040
接触到了槽壁
And it's contacting the socket wall

637
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:56,680
造成了短路
and causing a little bit of a short.

638
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:58,960
没事的
It's fine.

639
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,900
-你要我做什么  -放在那边桌上
- What do you want me to do? - Put that on the table over there.

640
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:03,220
-那个没用了  -天呐
- That is irrelevant. - Oh, my God!

641
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:04,680
你伸手进去
I want you to reach in,

642
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:07,050
轻轻地把电线拉出来
and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out.

643
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,360
-安全吗  -应该没事
- Is it safe? - Yeah, it should be fine.

644
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:11,770
就像手术游戏  别让电线
It's like Operation. You just don't let it

645
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:14,030
碰到槽壁就行  否则就会发出哔声
touch the socket wall or it goes "beep."

646
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:14,860
什么"手术游戏"
What do you mean, "Operation"?

647
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,200
就是个游戏  算了
It's just a game, never mind.

648
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:18,530
-轻轻地把电线拉出来  -好
- Just gently lift the wire. - Okay.

649
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:20,420
好吗  很好
Okay? Great.

650
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,690
我觉得我做这个不够格
You know, I don't think that I'm qualified to do this.

651
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:28,700
你可以的  你是我认识的最够格
No, you're fine. You're the most capable, qualified,

652
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:32,270
最值得信赖的人  你会做得很棒的
trustworthy person I've ever met. You're gonna do great.

653
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:35,510
这个要求太过分了吗  因为我
Is it too much of a problem to ask? 'Cause I'm...

654
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,570
-好吧  -我真的需要你帮忙
- Okay, okay. - I really need your help here.

655
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:39,440
好了
Okay.

656
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:45,470
有脓液
Oh, there's pus!

657
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,420
不是脓液
It's not pus.

658
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:50,090
是装置释放出的无机原生质
It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device,

659
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,290
-不是我身体分泌的  -好臭
- not from my body. - It smells!

660
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,450
是啊
Yeah, it does.

661
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:56,510
铜线  铜线  摸到了吗
The copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?

662
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,000
-好  摸到了  -摸到了吗
- Okay, I got it! I got it! - Okay, you got it?

663
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,900
拉出来时不要碰到槽壁
Now, don't let it touch the sides when you're coming out!

664
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:03,160
-我之前就是跟你强调这个  -抱歉
- That's what I was trying to tell you before. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

665
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:05,610
拉出来时  一定不要拉出...
Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, you don't...

666
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,070
最末端的磁铁
There's a magnet at the end of it!

667
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,800
就这个  你给拉出来了
That was it. You just pulled it out.

668
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:10,160
-天呐  -我没想到...
- Oh, God! - Okay, I was not expecting...

669
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:12,010
-别放回去  -我怎么办
- Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in! - Okay, what do I do?

670
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:13,280
怎么了
What's wrong?

671
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:14,850
没事  我就是要心脏骤停了
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest

672
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:15,930
-因为你像捞鱼一样  -什么
- 'cause you yanked - What?

673
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:17,660
-把它揪出来了  -你不是说挺安全的吗
- it out like a trout... - I though you said it was safe!

674
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:18,900
我们得快了  拿这个
We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

675
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:21,570
-迅速换好  -好
- You gotta switch it out really quick. - Okay. Okay.

676
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,470
-托尼  -什么
- Tony? - What?

677
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,690
-会没事的  -是吗
- It's going to be okay. - Is it?

678
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,680
不会有事的

就因为我从纽约带了披萨回来
Just because I brought pizza back from New York

780

被军阀赶出了他们的土地

-导弹来袭  -照明弹
- lnbound missile. - Flares!

1115
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:46,000
等等  不明物体调用了照明弹
Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!

1116
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:02,060
展开襟翼
Deploy flaps!

1117
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:04,410
我去
Holy!

1118
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,280
那玩意从雷达上消失了  长官
That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.

1119
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:07,930
卫星盯丢了
The sat visual has been lost.

1120
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,790
那绝不是无人机
No way that's a UAV.

1121
01:22:09,850 --> 01:22:10,870
是什么
What is it?

1122
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:12,300
我什么都看不到
I can't see anything.

1123
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:14,800
不管是什么  刚刚已经死了
Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.

1124
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:17,510
不明物体应该已经被处理掉了  长官
I think bogey's been handled, sir.

1125
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,340
-喂  -罗德  是我

1126
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:31,170
-谁  -抱歉  确实是我
- It's who? - I'm sorry, it is me.

1127
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:32,510
你问了  你问的那个就是我
You asked. What you were asking about is me.

1128
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:34,100
瞧  这不是游戏
No, see, this isn't a game.

1129
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:37,340
你不能把平民装备飞入我的活动战区
You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone.

1130
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:39,560
-你懂不懂  -不是一件装备
- You understand that? - This is not a piece of equipment.

1131
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:42,200
我在里面呢  是件战衣  那是我
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

1132
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:43,960
罗德  你查到什么了吗
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

1133
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:48,770
-标记位置  回基地  -收到  战情室
- Mark your position and return to base. - Roger that, Ballroom.

1134
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:52,610
在你底下
On your belly!

1135
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:54,710
像是个人
lt looks like a man!

1136
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:57,410
甩掉他  翻滚
Shake him off! Roll! Roll!

1137
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,970
我被打中了
I'm hit! I'm hit!

1138
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:08,620
确认  他被击中了
It's confirmed. He has been hit.

1139
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:14,800
跳伞
Punch out! Punch out!

1140
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,380
鞭子一号坠机
Whiplash One down.

1141
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:25,200
鞭子二号  看到降落伞了吗
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?

1142
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,470
没有  没有降落伞
Negative! No chute, no chute!

1143
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:34,430
我的降落伞卡住了
My chute's jammed!

1144
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:42,530
长官  我看到不明物体了
Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.

1145
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:43,930
鞭子二号  再次出击
Whiplash Two, reengage.

1146
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:45,750
如果能击落  就击落
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

1147
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,680
少校  我们都不知道那是什么
Major, we don't even know what we're shooting at.

1148
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:50,340
让猛禽回来
Call off the Raptors.

1149
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:51,730
那玩意刚在合法禁飞区内
That thing just took out an F- 22

1150
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:53,180
击落了一架F22
inside a legal no fly zone!

1151
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:55,870
鞭子二号  如果能击落  就击落
Whiplash Two, if you have a clear shot, take it!

1152
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:58,330
你又被锁定了  进行躲避操作
You've been reengaged. Execute evasive manoeuvre.

1153
01:23:58,330 --> 01:23:59,260
继续飞
Keep going!

1154
01:24:07,230 --> 01:24:09,290
降落伞打开
Good chute! Good chute!

1155
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,760
-托尼  你还在吗  -谢谢了
- Tony, you still there? - Hey, thanks.

1156
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,370
天呐  你个疯子
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.

1157
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:25,160
你欠我架飞机  你知道吧
You owe me a plane. You know that, right?

1158
01:24:26,450 --> 01:24:28,240
严格讲  是他撞了我
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.

1159
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:30,210
你要过来看看我在做什么吗
Now are you going to come by and see what I'm working on?

1160
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:33,360
不要  我知道得越少越好
No, no, no, no, no, no, the less I know, the better.

1161
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:35,320
我要怎么跟媒体讲
Now, what am I supposed to tell the press?

1162
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,900
演练  一般不都用这套屁话吗
Training exercise. Isn't that the usual BS?

1163
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:39,360
没那么简单
It's not that simple.

1164
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:42,370
昨天一架猛禽F22
An unfortunate training exercise

1165
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:45,480
在演练中不幸发生事故
involving an F-22 Raptor occurred yesterday.

1166
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:49,220
庆幸的是  飞行员并未受伤
I am pleased to report that the pilot was not injured.

1167
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:53,200
至于科米拉村庄意料之外的局势反转
As for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in Gulmira,

1168
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:57,060
是谁或是什么进行了干预  我们尚不清楚
it is still unclear who or what intervened,

1169
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:58,330
但我可以保证
but I can assure you that

1170
01:24:58,330 --> 01:25:01,300
此事与美国政府无关
the United States government was not involved.

1171
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:07,950
的确很贴身  先生
It is a tight fit, sir.

1172
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:11,980
先生  您越是扭动  就会越疼
Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt.

1173
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,720
温柔点  这是我第一次
Be gentle. This is my first time.

1174
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:16,910
我设计它能脱下来的  所以
I designed this to come off, so...

1175
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,410
我真的应该能
I really should be able to...

1176
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,980
请尽量不要动  先生
Please, try not to move, sir.

1177
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:25,720
怎么回事啊
What's going on here?

1178
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:31,790
承认吧
Let's face it.

1179
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:33,840
这不是你撞见我做的最糟糕的事
This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.

1180
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:37,350
那是弹孔吗
Are those bullet holes?

1181
01:26:05,170 --> 01:26:06,150
欢迎

1183

如果你当初按计划杀了他

1184
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:15,960
也不会把脸烧掉了
you'd still have a face.

1185
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:18,660
你给我们点小钱杀一位王子
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

1186

1187
01:26:21,670 --> 01:26:25,270
来吧  让守卫留在外面

他的逃脱带来了意外的收获

1189
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:48,990
他就是这么做到的
So this is how he did it.

01:26:49,430 --> 01:26:51,500
这只是首次的粗糙的尝试

1195
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,590
我们有共同的敌人
We have a common enemy.

1196
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:14,950
如果我们还在合作
If we are still in business,

1197
01:27:17,970 --> 01:27:20,030
我会把设计给你

在世界的这一带一直是个致命弱点
It's always been your Achilles' heel in this part of the world.

1205
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:00,970
别担心  只会持续15分钟
Don't worry. It'll only last for 1 5 minutes.

1206
01:28:01,810 --> 01:28:03,800
这是你最不需要担心的事了
That's the least of your problems.

1207
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:11,750
把装甲和其余的装箱带走
Crate up the armour and the rest of it.

1208
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:15,680
好  我们做个了结吧
All right, let's finish up here.

1209
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:22,710
让方舟反应堆下的16区做好准备
Set up Sector 16 underneath the arc reactor,

1210
01:28:22,710 --> 01:28:24,780
我需要遮蔽这些数据

1211
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:26,470
找来我们最好的工程师

马上给我造个原型机

你忙吗  可以替我去办件事吗
You busy? You mind if I send you on an errand?

1214
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,720
我需要你去我办公室
I need you to go to my office.

1215
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:43,580
黑入主机
You're going to hack into the mainframe

1216

01:28:49,330 --> 01:28:50,970
大概是在执行文档里
It's probably under Executive Files.

1220
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:52,800
要不  就是在幽灵驱动上
If not, they put it on a ghost drive,

1221
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,420
那样的话  你就得查找标题数码最小的
in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading.

1222
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:58,170
如果我拿回了信息
And what do you plan to do with this information

1223
01:28:58,170 --> 01:28:59,040
你打算怎么做呢
if I bring it back here?

1224
01:28:59,050 --> 01:29:00,090
还是那套
Same drill.

1225
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:02,140
他们在暗箱操作  我要阻止他们
They've been dealing under the table, and I'm going to stop them.

你知道我愿帮你做任何事

01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,630
但如果你又要这么胡来  我就不能帮你
but I cannot help you if you're going to start all of this again.

1230
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:19,550
除了这个  别无其他  没有艺术馆开幕
There is nothing except this. There's no art opening.

1231
01:29:19,550 --> 01:29:22,990
或是慈善晚会  或是签什么字

1232
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:27,290

是吗
Is that so?

1234
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:33,100
那我辞职
Well, then, I quit.

1235
01:29:36,230 --> 01:29:37,980
这么多年来  你一直在我身边
You stood by my side all these years

1236
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:40,570
看着我收获毁灭的利益
while I reaped the benefits of destruction.

1237
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,030
现在我想保护那些
And now that I'm trying to protect the people

1238
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:44,920
因我而身陷危险的人  你却要走人吗
that I put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?

1239
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:46,920
你会害死自己的  托尼
You're going to kill yourself, Tony.

1240
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:49,290
我不要助你一臂之力
I'm not going to be a part of it.

1241
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:50,920
我本不该活下来的
I shouldn't be alive,

1242
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,410
除非这有什么意义
unless it was for a reason.

1243
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:57,340
我没疯  派珀
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1244
01:29:58,090 --> 01:30:01,690
我就是终于知道  我该做什么了
I just finally know what I have to do.

1245
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:08,710
我心里知道  这是对的
And I know in my heart that it's right.

1246
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:25,950
你也是我的一切了
You're all I have, too, you know.

01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:20,250
托尼其实根本没有回家来  是吧
well, Tony never really did come home, did he?

1268

他把自己的一部分留在了那个洞里

Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!

1409
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:52,260
不必了  各位  只是演练
Not necessary, people. Just a training exercise.

1410
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:53,470
是  长官
Yes, sir.

1411
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:02,850
只剩13%的电力了  先生
Thirteen percent power, sir.

1412
01:48:02,850 --> 01:48:03,670
继续爬升
Climb!

1413
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:09,490
-11%  -继续飞
- Eleven percent. - Keep going!

1414
01:48:16,220 --> 01:48:18,350
-电力为7%  -在屏幕上显示就行
- Seven percent power. - Just leave it on the screen!

1415
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:19,380
别说了
Stop telling me!

1416
01:48:29,710 --> 01:48:31,290
你的点子很棒  托尼
You had a great idea, Tony,

1417
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:34,190
但我的战衣在各方面都更先进
but my suit is more advanced in every way!

1418
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,560
你怎么解决结冰问题的
How'd you solve the icing problem?

1419
01:48:36,950 --> 01:48:38,270
什么结冰问题
Icing problem?

1420
01:48:40,690 --> 01:48:42,130
最好查看一下
Might want to look into it.

1421
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:55,780
2%
Two percent.

1422
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:00,730
现在在使用紧急备用电力
We are now running on emergency backup power.

1423
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:16,210
-波茨  -托尼  天呐  你没事吧
- Potts! - Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

1424
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:17,550
我快没电了
I'm almost out of power.

1425
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:19,860
我得脱掉战衣  我就过去
I've got to get out of this thing. I'll be right there.

1426
01:49:20,390 --> 01:49:21,650
想得美
Nice try!

1427
01:49:34,710 --> 01:49:36,270
武器状态
Weapons status?

1428
01:49:36,460 --> 01:49:39,000
冲击系统下线  导弹下线
Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.

1429
01:49:42,910 --> 01:49:43,910
燃烧弹
Flares!

1430
01:49:52,870 --> 01:49:55,090
真聪明  托尼
Very clever, Tony.

1431
01:50:00,290 --> 01:50:02,830
-波茨  -托尼
- Potts? - Tony!

1432
01:50:02,830 --> 01:50:03,410
这样不行
This isn't working.

1433
01:50:03,410 --> 01:50:06,040
我们得过载反应堆  炸碎屋顶
We're going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.

1434
01:50:06,290 --> 01:50:09,180
-你要怎么做到  -你来做
- Well, how are you going to do that? - You're going to do it.

1435
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:11,720
去中央控制台  打开所有电路
Go to the central console, open up all the circuits.

1436
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:13,020
等我撤离了屋顶  就告诉你
When I get clear of the roof, I'll let you know.

1437
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:15,420
你就按下主旁路按钮
You're going to hit the master bypass button.

1438
01:50:16,010 --> 01:50:17,670
上面的一切都会被烧毁
It's going to fry everything up here.

1439
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:21,840
好  我这就进去
Okay. I'm going in now.

1440
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:24,990
一定等我离开屋顶的  我给你争取点时间
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I'll buy you some time.

1441
01:50:34,650 --> 01:50:36,100
这个看上去挺重要
This looks important!

1442
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:59,870
我一向不怎么喜欢这种玩意
I never had a taste for this sort of thing,

1443
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:04,570
但我得承认  我非常喜欢这件战衣
but I must admit, I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

1444
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:15,120
你可算超常发挥了  托尼
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

1445
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:19,700
你会让你父亲自豪的
You'd have made your father proud!

1446
01:51:24,650 --> 01:51:26,740
准备好了  托尼  快离开屋顶
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

1447
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:48,130
托尼
Tony!

1448
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:50,950
真是讽刺  托尼
How ironic, Tony!

1449
01:51:52,730 --> 01:51:54,830
你想让世界上不再有武器
Trying to rid the world of weapons,

1450
01:51:55,430 --> 01:51:57,650
却发明了最棒的武器
you gave it its best one ever!

1451
01:51:57,650 --> 01:51:59,970
-派珀  -现在
- Pepper! - And now

1452
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:03,500
我要拿它杀了你
I'm going to kill you with it!

1453
01:52:06,730 --> 01:52:10,720
-你扯掉了我的瞄准系统  -按按钮
- You ripped out my targeting system! - Time to hit the button!

1454
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:14,730
-你叫我别按的  -别动  你个小混蛋
- You told me not to! - Hold still, you little prick!

1455
01:52:16,590 --> 01:52:19,540
-动手吧  -你会死的
- Just do it! - You'll die!

1456
01:52:22,390 --> 01:52:23,740
按吧
Push it!

1457
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:22,790
托尼
Tony!

1458
01:53:31,410 --> 01:53:33,360
各位都拿到了昨晚斯塔克工业
You've all received the official statement of

1459
01:53:31,490 --> 01:53:43,210
{\an8}詹姆斯·罗德中校  斯塔克工业事件

1460
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:35,850
事件经过的官方报告
what occurred at Stark lndustries last night.

1461
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:38,140
有未经证实的报告称
There have been unconfirmed reports

1462
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:40,960
一件机器人原型机发生故障
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned

1463
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,630
导致方舟反应堆受损
and caused damage to the arc reactor.

1464
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:46,680
幸好  托尼·斯塔克的一位私人保镖
Fortunately, a member of Tony Stark's personal security staff...

1465
01:53:44,420 --> 01:53:47,290
{\an8}钢铁侠是谁

1466
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:48,630
"钢铁侠"  挺上口  挺响亮的
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it.

1467
01:53:48,630 --> 01:53:49,980
虽然并不准确
I mean, it's not technically accurate.

1468
01:53:49,980 --> 01:53:52,360
战衣是金钛合金
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

1469
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:55,150
但这种意向呼之欲出
but it's kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway.

1470
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:56,340
这是你的不在场证明
Here's your alibi.

1471
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:58,750
好
Okay.

1472
01:53:58,830 --> 01:54:01,060
-你在你的游艇上  -嗯
- You were on your yacht. - Yeah.

1473
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:03,250
我们有港口报告证明你整晚都在阿瓦隆
We have port papers that put you in Avalon all night,

1474
01:54:03,250 --> 01:54:05,190
还有你50位宾客的宣誓证词
and sworn statements from 50 of your guests.

1475
01:54:05,190 --> 01:54:08,250
或许该说只有我和派珀
See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me

1476
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:10,130
单独在岛上
alone on the island.

1477
01:54:11,390 --> 01:54:12,740
-就是这样的  -好吧
- That's what happened. - All right.

1478
01:54:12,740 --> 01:54:14,310
照读就行
Just read it, word for word.

1479
01:54:16,790 --> 01:54:18,240
上面没提斯坦尼
There's nothing about Stane here.

1480
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:21,900
这已经处理好了  他去度假了
That's being handled. He's on vacation.

1481
01:54:22,450 --> 01:54:24,990
小型飞机的安全记录很差
Small aircraft have such a poor safety record.

1482
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,680
但关于保镖的那套掩护说辞呢
But what about the whole cover story that it's a bodyguard?

1483
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:28,930
他是我的...这...
He's my... I mean, is that...

1484
01:54:28,930 --> 01:54:30,490
这太站不住脚了吧
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

1485
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:32,690
我不是第一次做这种事了  斯塔克先生
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr Stark.

1486
01:54:33,010 --> 01:54:34,170
按官方说辞念就行
Just stick to the official statement,

1487
01:54:34,170 --> 01:54:36,190
很快  这一切都会过去了
and soon, this will all be behind you.

1488
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:39,590
你有90秒
You've got 90 seconds.

1489
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:43,330
科尔森特工
Agent Coulson?

1490
01:54:44,590 --> 01:54:48,830
我想说  非常感谢你的一切帮助
I just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help.

1491
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:52,170
这是我们的职责  我们还会再联系的
That's what we do. You'll be hearing from us.

1492
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:55,560
-你们叫国土战略  -喊我们神盾局就行
- From the Strategic Homeland... - Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1493
01:54:56,170 --> 01:54:57,130
好
Right.

1494
01:54:58,270 --> 01:54:59,890
我们开始吧
Let's get this show on the road.

1495
01:54:59,890 --> 01:55:02,110
其实也没那么糟
You know, it's actually not that bad.

1496
01:55:02,110 --> 01:55:03,810
就连我都不觉得自己像钢铁侠
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

1497
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:06,240
-你不是钢铁侠  -我是
- You're not Iron Man. - Am so.

1498
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:08,270
-你不是  -好吧  随你
- You're not. - All right, suit yourself.

1499
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:10,260
如果我是钢铁侠
You know, if I were Iron Man,

1500
01:55:10,260 --> 01:55:12,700
我会有个知道我真实身份的女友
I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

1501
01:55:12,700 --> 01:55:13,540
而且她会很崩溃
She'd be a wreck,

1502
01:55:13,540 --> 01:55:15,280
因为她会非常担心我会不会送命
'cause she'd always be worrying that I was going to die,

1503
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:17,870
但又为我的成就感到骄傲
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

1504
01:55:17,870 --> 01:55:22,390
她会非常矛盾  而这又让她更加
She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more

1505
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,450
为我疯狂了
crazy about me.

1506
01:55:24,450 --> 01:55:26,230
你难道就没想过那晚的事吗
Tell me you never think about that night.

1507
01:55:26,250 --> 01:55:27,790
-哪一晚  -你知道的
- What night? - You know.

1508
01:55:31,070 --> 01:55:32,240
你是说
Are you talking about

1509
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:34,270
我们一起跳舞的那晚吗
the night that we danced

1510
01:55:34,270 --> 01:55:36,750
然后我们上了屋顶
and went up on the roof,

1511
01:55:38,430 --> 01:55:39,650
然后
and then

1512
01:55:40,870 --> 01:55:44,120
你去楼下拿酒
you went downstairs to get me a drink,

1513
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:47,840
然后就撇下了我一人
and you left me there, by myself?

1514
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:50,340
你是说那晚吗
Is that the night you're talking about?

1515
01:55:53,390 --> 01:55:54,520
我猜也是
Thought so.

1516
01:55:57,110 --> 01:55:58,010
没有别的事了吧  斯塔克先生
Will that be all, Mr Stark?

1517
01:55:58,010 --> 01:56:00,970
是的  没别的事了  波茨小姐
Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1518
01:56:00,970 --> 01:56:04,570
现在  斯塔克先生准备了一份声明
And now, Mr Stark has prepared a statement.

1519
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:07,700
他不会接受提问的  谢谢
He will not be taking any questions. Thank you.

1520
01:56:11,820 --> 01:56:14,020
自我上次见大家过去好一阵了
Been a while since I was in front of you.

1521
01:56:14,020 --> 01:56:15,950
我这次还是照稿读吧
I figure I'll stick to the cards this time.

1522
01:56:18,890 --> 01:56:19,830
有人猜测
There's been speculation

1523
01:56:19,830 --> 01:56:21,910
我卷入了之前发生在
that I was involved in the events that occurred

1524
01:56:21,910 --> 01:56:23,180
高速和屋顶上的事件
on the freeway and the rooftop...

1525
01:56:23,180 --> 01:56:24,290
抱歉  斯塔克先生
I'm sorry, Mr Stark,

1526
01:56:24,290 --> 01:56:26,150
你真的指望我们相信
but do you honestly expect us to believe that

1527
01:56:26,150 --> 01:56:30,040
那是一个穿战衣的保镖  碰巧出现
that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared,

1528
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:32,820
-尽管你...  -我知道情况让人糊涂
- despite the fact that you... - I know that it's confusing.

1529
01:56:33,260 --> 01:56:35,900
质疑官方说辞是一回事
It is one thing to question the official story,

1530
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:38,240
但提出疯狂指控  或暗示说
and another thing entirely to make wild accusations,

1531
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:40,400
我是个超级英雄可是另一码事了
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

1532
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:42,080
我可没说你是超级英雄
I never said you were a superhero.

1533
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:43,640
是吗  那很好
Didn't? Well, good,

1534
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:47,800
因为那是不着边际  异想天开的
because that would be outlandish and fantastic.

1535
01:56:49,390 --> 01:56:53,040
我显然不是做英雄的料
I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.

1536
01:56:53,210 --> 01:56:56,310
我有一堆性格缺陷
With this laundry list of character defects,

1537
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:57,760
犯过那么多错误
all the mistakes I've made,

1538
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:01,240
-还很公开  -照稿读就行
- largely public. - Just stick to the cards, man.

1539
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:03,150
好  好
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1540
01:57:05,010 --> 01:57:06,090
事实就是
The truth is

1541
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:14,060
我就是钢铁侠
I am Iron Man.

1542
02:05:17,380 --> 02:05:18,470
贾维斯
Jarvis!

1543
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:20,680
欢迎回家  先生
Welcome home, sir.

1544
02:05:23,900 --> 02:05:25,990
"我就是钢铁侠"
"I am Iron Man."

1545
02:05:26,830 --> 02:05:29,560
你以为你是这世上唯一的超级英雄吗
You think you're the only superhero in the world?

1546
02:05:29,790 --> 02:05:30,500
斯塔克先生
Mr Stark,

1547
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:32,920
你已经成为了更大的宇宙的一部分
you've become part of a bigger universe.

1548
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:35,250
你只是现在还不知道
You just don't know it yet.

1549
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,540
你是谁
Who the hell are you?

1550
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:40,200
尼克·弗瑞  神盾局局长
Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1551
02:05:42,170 --> 02:05:44,800
我来跟你谈谈复仇者联盟
I'm here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative.

00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,020
那是什么
What is that?

332
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,060
是初级躯体感觉皮层
It's the primary somatosensory cortex.

333
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,520
大脑中感知疼痛的部分
It's the brain's pain center.

334
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,920
这才是我想给你看的
But this is what I wanted to show you.

335
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,460
绝境病毒开发了我们的生物潜能
Now, Extremis harnesses our bioelectrical potential

336
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,210
现在看  这里
And it goes...here.

337
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,190
这基本上是个空槽
This is essentially an empty slot,

338
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,620
这说明我们的大脑
and what this tells us is that our mind,

339
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,350
其实是我们的整个DNA
our entire DNA in fact,

340
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,090
注定该被升级
is destined to be upgraded.

341
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,880
{\an8}派珀·波茨改革斯塔克工业

342
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,910
你好
Hello?

343
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,090
是安保额头吗
Is this forehead of Security?

344
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,810
什么
What?

345
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,400
听着  我有正事呢  你有什么事
You know, look, I got a real job. What do you want?

346
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,600
我在工作  现在有情况
I'm working, I got something going on here.

347
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,740
什么情况  骚扰实习生吗
What? Harassing interns?

348
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,320
我告诉你一件事
Let me tell you something,

349
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,120
当我告诉大家我曾是钢铁侠的保镖时
you know what happened when I told people

350
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,260
你知道他们什么反应吗
I was Iron Man's body guard?

351
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,780
他们无情地嘲笑我
They would laugh in my face.

352
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,920
我只能带着最后一丝尊严离开
I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity.

353
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,840
现在我有了真正的工作  照顾派珀
Now I got a real job, I'm watching Pepper.

354
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,230
发生了什么  告诉我
What's going on? Fill me in.

355
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,920
-真要听吗  -对
- For real? - Yeah.

356
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,760
好吧  她在会见一个科学家
Alright, so she's meeting up with this scientist.

357
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,330
-阔佬  长得也帅  -好吧
- Rich guy, handsome. - Right.

358
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,570
我一开始没认出他来
I couldn't make his face at first, right?

359
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,630
你也知道我认人最在行了
You know I'm good with faces.

360
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,290
没错  你是个中翘楚
Oh, Yeah, yeah. You're the best.

361
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,470
就是  然后我查了他的信息
Yeah. Well, so I run his credentials,

362
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,350
才认出他  阿德里奇·基里安
I make him Aldrich Killian.

363
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,030
我们以前其实见过他
We actually met the guy back in...

364
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,430
1999年  在哪来着  那个科学会议
where were we in '99? The science conference?

365
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,540
在瑞士
Switzerland.

366
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,500
对  没错  就是那儿
Right, right, exactly.

367
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,920
基里安  不  我不记得那家伙
Killian? No, I don't remember that guy.

368
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,660
你当然不记得  他又不是金发大波妹
Of course you don't. He's not a blond with a big rack.

369
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,050
一开始还好  他们只是谈生意
At first it was fine, they were talking business,

370
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,120
但现在有点蹊跷了
but now it's like getting weird.

371
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,640
他正在给她看他的大大脑
He's showing her his big brain.

372
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,430
他的什么
His what?

373
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,170
放大的大脑  她也乐在其中
Big brain, and she likes it.

374
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,320
让我给你看
Here, let me show you.

375
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,940
等一下  看到了吗
Hold on. See?

376
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,950
看到什么  看到你在偷窥吗
Look at what? You watching them?

377
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,680
把屏幕翻过去我才能看到
Flip the screen and then we can get started.

378
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,030
我又不是你这种科学天才
I'm not a tech genius like you.

379
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,480
相信我  快过来吧
Just...just trust me, get down down here.

380
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,850
翻转屏幕  让我看到他们在做什么
Flip the screen, then I can see what they're doing.

381
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,850
我不会  我不会翻转屏幕
I can't! I don't know how to flip the screen!

382
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,740
别再那样对我说话了
Don't talk to me like that anymore.

383
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,030
你可不是我老板
You're not my boss.

384
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,180
我又不为你工作
Alright, I don't work for you.

385
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,740
我不信任这家伙
Now I don't trust this guy.

386
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,880
他还带了个鬼鬼祟祟的家伙
He's got another guy with him, he's shifty.

387
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,620
-放松点  -真的吗
- Relax. - Seriously?

388
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,500
我只是让你守住周边
I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter.

389
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,520
让他出去喝一杯什么的
Tell him to go out for a drink or something?

390
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,360
你知道吗  你真的应该
You know what? You should take more

391
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,580
好好关注一下事态发展
of an interest in what's going on here.

392
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,370
这女人是你生命中最美好的际遇
This woman... this woman's the best thing that ever happened to you,

393
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,120
而你呢  你却不知珍惜
and you... you're just ignoring her.

394
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,740
巨型大脑吗
A giant brain?

395
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,350
没错  巨型大脑  还有个鬼祟之徒
Yeah, there's a giant brain, there's a shifty character.

396
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,700
我要去跟着他
I'm gonna follow this guy.

397
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,100
查他的车牌  要是他来硬的  那就来吧
I'm gonna run his plates and if it gets rough, so be it.

398
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,490
我想念你  哈皮
I miss you, Happy.

399
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,630
我也想念你
Yeah, I miss you too.

400
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,070
但是想念以前的样子
But the way it used to be.

401
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,030
现在你都跟超级英雄朋友泡在一起
Now you're off with the 'superfriends',

402
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,490
我都不知道你什么情况了
I don't know what's going on with you anymore.

403
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,170
世界越来越奇怪了
The world's getting weird...

404
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,540
抱歉  我得挂断你了
Hey, I... I'd hate to cut you off.

405
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,650
-你带着电击枪吗  -怎么了
- Do you have your taser on you? - Why?

406
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,460
人力资源部好像有个女孩
I think there's a gal in HR

407
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,810
在试图偷打印机墨水
who's trying to steal some printer ink,

408
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,250
你应该过去教训她一下
you should probably go over there and zap her.

409
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,450
好极了
Yeah, nice.

410
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,550
想象一下  如果你可以侵入
Imagine if you could hack into the hard drive of

411
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,970
任何生物体的"硬盘"  然后重组其DNA
any living organism and recode its DNA.

412
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,280
那太惊人了
It would be incredible.

413
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,710
不幸的是  听起来也很有武器化前途
Unfortunately, to my ears it also sounds highly weaponizable.

414
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,550
比如改造士兵  和私人军队  托尼他...
As in enhanced soldiers, private armies, and Tony is not...

415
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,260
托尼  托尼
Tony. Tony.

416
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,760
13年前我曾邀请托尼加入AIM
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM thirteen years ago,

417
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,400
他拒绝了
he turned me down.

418
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:56,930
但现在我发现
But something tells me

419
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,500
掌权的是另一个天才
now there is a new genius on the throne

420
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,470
她不必向托尼汇报
who doesn't have to answer to Tony anymore,

421
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,360
也没那么自负
and who has slightly less of an ego.

422
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,480
我的答案是不  阿德里奇
It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.

423
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,500
我虽然非常想帮你
As much as I'd like to help you.

424
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,360
好吧  我确实有点失望
Well, I can't say that I'm not disappointed.

425
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,890
但正如我父亲曾说的
But then as my father used to say,

426
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,610
透过失败的迷雾  才能窥见胜利的光辉
'Failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph.'

427
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,920
很有深度
That's very deep.

428
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,860
但我不知道是什么意思
And I have no idea what it means.

429
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,440
我也不懂  我爸就是个傻瓜
Well, me neither. He was kind of an idiot, my old man.

430
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,530
我们一定会再见的  派珀
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.

431
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,950
哈皮
Happy...

432
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,040
车备好了  你准备好出发了吗
The car is ready, if you're ready to go.

433
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,560
嗯  我只是...
Yes. I just um...

434
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,790
忘了点什么东西  我得去...
God, I forgot my other thing, so I'm just gonna...

435
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,100
{\an8}圣诞快乐  派珀

436
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,620
抱歉我来晚了  我刚才在  这是什么
I'm sorry I'm late. I was... What the...? What is that?!

437
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,820
你在屋里也要穿了吗
You're wearing this in the house now?

438
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,060
那是什么  马克15型吗
What is that, like Mark 15?

439
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,360
{\an8}马克42型

440
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,070
嗯  差不多吧
Yeah. Something like that.

441
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,840
人总得有个爱好
You know everybody needs a hobby.

442
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,920
你非得在客厅里穿着你的爱好吗
And you have to wear your hobby in the living room?

443
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,380
新衣服要适应
Just breakin' it in.

444
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,680
你明白吧  裤裆那里总是有点紧
You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so.

445
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,980
你看到你的圣诞礼物了吗
Did you see your Christmas present?

446
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,030
看到了
Yes, I did.

447
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,200
我没办法错过那么大的圣诞礼物
I... I don't know how I could have missed that Christmas present.

448
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,100
能搬进门来吗
Is it gonna fit through the door?

449
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,840
这个问题问得好
Well actually, uh...it's a good question.

450
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,090
明天我叫了一队人来
I got a team of guys comin' tomorrow,

451
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,910
-他们会把墙炸了  -好吧
- they're gonna blow out that wall. - Okay.

452
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,620
今天忙不忙  还是挺好
So, uh... tense? Good day?

453
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,320
按摩一下肩吧  你这个调皮的小女孩
Ooh shoulders, a little naughty. Naughty girl.

454
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,230
我不想啰嗦  不过你喜欢那订制的兔子吗
I don't wanna harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?

455
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,410
我喜欢吗
Did I like it?

456
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,860
俘虏了你的心  对吧
Nailed it, right?

457
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,400
我很感激你的心思
I appreciate the thought very much.

458
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,920
你为什么不掀起面罩  给我一个热吻呢
So why don't you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?

459
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,340
哎呀  该死  打不开
Yup, dammit. No can do.

460
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,810
你要不要亲在...
You wanna just kiss it on the...

461
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,420
面罩缝上
The facial slit?

462
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,450
那不如我去车库
Well, why don't I run down to the garage

463
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,090
找个撬棍把它弄开
and see if I can't find a crowbar to shimmy that thing open?

464
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,320
撬棍  真棒
Crowbar. Yeah.

465
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,350
可是车库...那个  辐射泄漏了
Oh, except there's been a...uh...A radiation leak.

466
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,470
我愿意冒这个险
I'll take my chances.

467
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,420
太危险了
That's risky.

468
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,730
至少让我给你找件防护衣
At least let me get you like a Hazmat suit

469
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,730
或是盖革计数器之类的东西
or a Geiger counter or something like that.

470
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,210
被发现了
Busted.

471
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,080
你真是无聊到新境界了
This is a new level of lame.

472
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,720
对不起
Sorry.

473
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,720
今晚是约会之夜  你不等我就吃了
You ate without me, already? On date night?

474
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,520
-他只是...  -你是说你吧
- He was just... - You mean you?

475
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,930
没错  我是说我们  只是在招待你
Well, yeah. I mean we were just... just hosting you.

476
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,180
我做完了点工作
While I finished up a little work.

477
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,560
所以就吃了一点东西
And yes, I had a quick bite.

478
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,500
我不知道你回不回家
I didn't know if you were comin' home

479
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,110
还是跟阿德里奇·基里安喝酒去了
or if you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.

480
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,990
干什么
What?

481
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,710
怎么了
What?

482
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,350
阿德里奇·基里安  你还查我岗吗
Aldrich Killian? What are you checking up on me?

483
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,920
哈皮觉得担心
Happy was concerned.

484
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,430
-不  你就是在监视我  -我没有
- No, you're spying on me. - I wasn't...

485
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,120
我要去睡觉了
I'm going to bed.

486
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,280
等等  别走  小派
Hold on. Come on. Pep.

487
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,750
好吧  我承认是我错了  对不起
Hey, I admit it! My fault. Sorry.

488
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,410
我最近一团糟
I'm a piping hot mess.

489
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,630
有段时间了  我一直没告诉你
It's been going on for a while, I haven't said anything.

490
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,420
纽约事件后  一切都变了
Nothing's been the same since New York.

491
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:35,190
是吗  我可完全没有注意到
Oh really? Well, I didn't notice that, at all.

492
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,110
你经历了一些事
You experience things

493
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,870
事情过去后  你还是没法解释清楚
and then they're over and you still can't explain 'em.

494
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,150
神  外星人  其他空间
Gods, aliens, other dimensions.

495
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,150
我只是一个躲在铁壳里的人
I... I'm just a man in a can.

496
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,460
我至今还没有崩溃的原因
The only reason I haven't cracked up

497
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,270
大概就是因为你搬来和我一起住
is probably because you moved in.

498
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,220
这太好了  我爱你  我很幸运
Which is great. I love you, I'm lucky.

499
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,360
但是  宝贝  我睡不着
But, honey, I can't sleep.

500
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,880
你睡着了  我就下来
You go to bed, I come down here.

501
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,040
做我熟悉的事
I do what I know,

502
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,010
敲敲打打
I tinker.

503
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,700
但是危险即将来临
But threat is imminent,

504
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,690
我必须保护我唯一不能失去的东西
and I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without.

505
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,410
就是你
That's you.

506
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,480
我的战衣  它们只是
My suits, they're uh...

507
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,690
机器而已
Machines.

508
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,790
但它们是我的一部分
But they're part of me.

509
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,000
这只是个消遣
A distraction.

510
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,170
也许吧
Maybe.

511
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,440
我要去洗个澡
I'm gonna take a shower.

512
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,420
好吧
Okay.

513
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,190
你也一起来吧
And you're gonna join me.

514
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,480
更好了
Better.

515
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
托尼
Tony!

516
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,160
托尼  托尼
Tony! Tony!

517
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,630
托尼
Tony...

518
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,200
关闭电源
Power down!

519
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,650
我一定是在睡梦中启动了它
I must have called it in my sleep.

520
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,240
这事不应该发生的
That's not supposed to happen.

521
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,360
我会重新校准一下传感器
I'll recalibrate the sensors.

522
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,390
我们能不能  让我
Can we just... just let me...

523
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,120
让我先喘口气好吗
just let me catch my breath, okay?

524
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,990
别走  好吗  派珀
Don't go, alright? Pepper?

525
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,210
我要去楼下睡  你去敲打那个吧
I'm going to sleep downstairs. Tinker with that.

526
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,480
你扛得住吗
Can you regulate?

527
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,040
扛得住
Yes, I can regulate.

528
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,830
你确定吗
Are you sure about that?

529
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,740
确定
Yes.

530
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,820
这批货不错
It's a decent batch.

531
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,260
别说我不为你着想
Don't say I never did nothin' for you.

532
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,220
谢谢
Thank you.

533
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,590
理解万岁
I mean for understanding.

534
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,150
对不起  伙计
I'm sorry, buddy.

535
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,720
你干什么呢  伙计  自己出来的吗
What are you doin', buddy? You out by yourself?

536
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,310
约会之夜吗  看你最喜欢的言情片
A little date night? Watching your favorite chick flick maybe?

537
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,060
没错  一部叫做《派对结束》的电影
Yeah, a little movie called "The Party's Over",

538
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,040
主角是你和你嗑药的女朋友
starring you and your junkie girlfriend,

539
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,580
这是电影票
and here's the ticket.

540
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,890
开玩笑吧  那不是你的东西
No kidding? That doesn't belong to you.

541
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,980
萨文
Savin!

542
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,290
救救我  救救我
Help! Help me!

543
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,800
福饼的真相是
True story about fortune cookies.

544
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,690
它们看上去像来自中国
They look Chinese,

545
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:16,490
听上去也像
they sound Chinese,

546
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,130
但其实它们是美国制造
but they're actually an American invention.

547
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,140
所以它们是空心的
Which is why they're hollow,

548
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,250
充满了谎言
full of lies,

549
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,230
还会在嘴里留下恶心的味道
and leave a bad taste in the mouth.

550
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:34,010
我的门徒刚摧毁了又一个廉价的美国山寨
My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knock-off,

551
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,890
中国剧院
The Chinese Theater.

552
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,360
总统先生  我知道这一定很令人沮丧
Mr. President, I know this must be getting frustrating,

553
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:47,240
但是这一季度的恐怖事件已经接近尾声了
but this season of terror is drawing to a close.

554
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,260
别担心  好戏还在后头呢
And don't worry, the big one is coming;

555
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,560
你的毕业典礼

556
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,340
别关电视行吗
Mind leaving that on?

557
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,840
好的
Sure.

558
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,000
周日晚上的固定节目《唐顿庄园》

他最喜欢看这个  他觉得很高雅

560

还有  让所有人都带上门卡
One more thing... make sure everyone wears their badges.

561
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,940
他对这种事情特别固执
He's a stickler for that sort of thing,

562
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,730
不然我的人不会让进的
plus my guys won't let anyone in without them.

563
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,260
我们在等待托尼·斯塔克的到来

给我们一些回应

566
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,930

有消息说
Our sources are telling us that

568
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,140
这又是一次满大人发动的袭击事件
this is another Mandarin attack.

569
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,750
您对此怎么说
Anything else you can tell us?

570
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,950
斯塔克先生
Mr. Stark!

571
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,050
什么时候才会有人杀了这家伙
When is somebody gonna kill this guy?

572
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,000
我就说说
Just sayin'.

573
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,890
你就想听这个吗
Is that what you want?

574
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,650
我早想给满大人
Here's a little holiday greeting

575
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,900
一个小小的节日问候
I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin.

576
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,220
我刚刚才想好措辞
I just didn't know how to phrase it until now.

577
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,880
我叫托尼·斯塔克  我不怕你
My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you.

578
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,770
我知道你是个懦夫
I know you're a coward,

579
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:18,170
所以我决定  你是死人了  伙计
so I've decided that you just died, pal.

580
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,890
我会亲自去收尸
I'm gonna come get the body.

581
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,200
无关政治
There's no politics here;

582
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,310
只有老式的复仇
it's just good old-fashioned revenge.

583
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,390
无关五角大楼
There's no Pentagon;

00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,300
只有你和我
it's just you and me.

去过田纳西州吗  贾维斯

634
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,070
正在安排飞往田纳西州的计划
Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.

635
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,330
现在还允许人来访吗
Are we still at "ding-dong"?

636
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,040
我们现在应该是高度戒严状态
We're supposed to be on total security lock down.

637
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,370
拜托  我刚威胁了一个恐怖分子  那是谁
Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?

638
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,510
我对此无能为力  先生
There's only so much I can do, sir,

639
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,190
是你把地址给了全世界的记者
when you give the world's press your home address.

640
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,520
站在那儿别动
Right there's fine.

641
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,660
你不是满大人  对吧
You're not the Mandarin, are you?

642
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,180
对吧
Are you?

643
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:43,470
你不记得了  我怎么都不惊讶呢
You don't remember. Why am I not surprised?

644
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,160
别往心里去
Don't take it personally,

645
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,510
我都不记得我早餐吃了什么
I don't remember what I had for breakfast.

646
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,120
无麸质华夫饼  先生
Gluten-free waffles, sir.

647
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,030

That's right.

00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,000
好吧  我要和你单独谈谈
Okay, look, I need to be alone with you.

649
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,920
别在这里  是要紧事
Some place not here, it's urgent.

650
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,110
我一般不会拒绝这种事的
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing,

651
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,390
但现在我有了个正式的女朋友
but now I'm in a committed relationship.

652
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,850
就是她
It's... with her.

00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,950
托尼  有客人吗
Tony, is somebody there?

654
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,690
是的  是玛雅·汉森
Yeah, it's Maya Hansen.

655
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,450
一个植物学家老朋友  不太熟
Old botanist pal that I used to know, barely.

656
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,530
别告诉我有个我从没见过的
Please don't tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid

657
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,120
12岁孩子在车里等我
waiting in the car that I've never met.

658
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,110
他13岁了
He's thirteen.

659
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,770
别傻了  我需要你的帮助
And no, I need your help.

660
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,450
帮什么  为什么是这时候
What... what for? Why now?

661
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,020
因为我读了报纸  而且
Because I read the papers, and,

662
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,690
坦白说  我觉得你活不过这周了
frankly, I don't think you'll last the week.

663
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,740
我会没事的
I'll be fine.

664
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,440
对不起  哈皮住院了
I'm sorry. With Happy in the hospital,

665
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,480
我不知道会有客人来
I didn't know we were expecting guests.

666
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,120
不是客人
We weren't.

667
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,510
-不  我  -旧情人吗
- No, I... - And old girlfriends!

668
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,290
不算是
She's not really.

669
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:33,240
不是  顶多就是一夜情
No, not really. It... it was just one night.

670

没错
Yep.

671
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,390
果然是你的风格啊
That's how you did it, isn't it?

-没错  -美好的一晚
- Yep. - It was a great night.

673
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,900
其实
Well, you know...

674
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,830
-幸好你抽身的早  -你说什么
- You have saved yourself a world of pain. - What?

675
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,820
-我想也是  -相信我
- I'm sure. - Trust me.

676
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,800
咱们要出城去躲躲
We're going out of town.

677
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,080
咱们谈过了  不可以
Okay, we've been through this. Nope.

678
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,690
可以
Yep!

679
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,360
男人说了不可以
The man says no.

680

-马上就走  短期不回  -宝贝
- Immediately and indefinitely! - Honey...

681
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,380
好主意  咱们走吧
Great idea. Let's go.

682
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,630
对不起  这是个糟透了的主意
I'm sorry. That's a terrible idea.

683
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,900
-别碰她的包  -托尼
- Please don't touch her bags. - Tony,

684
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,670
正常人都会这么做
this is how normal people behave.

685
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,210
在外面我没法保护你  我挑衅了...
I can't protect you out there. I challenged...

686
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,460
那个正常吗
Is... is that normal?

687
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,920
-可悲的是  -正常得很
- Sadly, that... - Yes, this is normal!

688
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,100
那个特别正常
is very normal.

689
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,740
那只是个大兔子  别大惊小怪的
It's a big bunny, relax about it!

690
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,990
冷静点
Calm down!

691
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,480
这是我送给你的
I got this for you.

692
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,690
{\an8}斯塔克放出狠话

693
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,960
-我知道  -你都没跟我说
- I'm aware of that. - You still haven't even told me

694
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,690
你喜欢它
that you liked it!

695
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,160
-我不喜欢  -我问过你三次
- I don't like it! - I asked you three...

696
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,010
-你居然不喜欢  -托尼

698
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,360
-两位  -这事没的商量

700
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,300
我们是不是要担心一下那个
Do we need to worry about that?

701
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,710
我保护你
I got you.

702
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:05,970
是我先保护你的
I got you first.

703
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,620
就像我说的  我们不能待在这儿了
Like I said, we can't stay here.

704
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:19,070
快走  我就来
Move! I'm right behind!

705
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,420
带她走  我自己想办法出去
Get her, I'm gonna find a way around.

706
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:28,340
别停下  去找她  带她走
Stop stopping! Get her, get outside!

707
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,330
快
Go!

708
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,280

先生  波茨小姐已经安全离开了
Sir, Miss Potts is clear of the structure.

贾维斯  我的飞行能量呢

711
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,930
正在处理  先生  这只是一件原型机
Working on it, sir. This is a prototype.

712
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,940

解决一架
That's one.

714
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,290
先生  这套战衣还不能用于战斗
Sir, the suit is not combat-ready.

715
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,160
第二架
That's two.

716
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:39,030
托尼
Tony!

那是紧急警报
That's the emergency alert

722
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,490
触发原因是能量已降至5%以下
triggered by the power dropping below five percent.

723
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,820
这是在下雪吧
It's snowing, right?

724
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,840
我们在哪  州北吗
Where are we, upstate?

725
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,570
我们在田纳西州玫瑰山外五英里处
We're five miles outside of Rose Hills, Tennessee.

726
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,550
为什么

727
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,110
贾维斯
Jarvis!

728
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,940
我没说要来这里
Not my idea!

729

我们为什么来这里  差了十万八千里
What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away!

730
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,040
我得去找派珀  我得...

弹射打开
Open eject.

00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:06,710
这才爽
That's brisk!

736
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,190
我还是进去待一会儿吧

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,140
贾维斯
Jarvis?

740
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,180
别丢下我  伙计
Don't leave me, buddy.

741
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:45,350

但是时间有限  首先

00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,570
很抱歉让你处于危险的境地
I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way.

748
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,560
那很自私也很愚蠢  以后再也不会了
That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again.

749
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,540
还有  现在是圣诞  那兔子太大了
Also, it's Christmas time, the rabbit's too big.

750
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,050
就这样  对不起
Done. I'm sorry.

751
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,680

我得找到那家伙  你要注意安全
I need to find this guy. You gotta stay safe.

754
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,190
我就想说这个
That's all I know.

755
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,720
我刚从一个印第安木人身上偷了一件斗篷
I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian.

756
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,800

被你抓住了
You got me.

土豆枪不错
Nice potato gun.

762
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,610
就是枪管有点长
Barrel's a little long.

763
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:22,360
又长又粗的话  会减弱它的攻击力
Between that and the wide gauge, it's gonna diminish your FPS

764
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,880
现在你还没弹药了
And now you're out of ammo.

765

你胸口上那个东西是什么

是个电磁体  你应该懂的

它是给什么供电的
What does it power?

769
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,620
我的天啊
Oh my God!

770
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,940
那个
That...

771
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:53,930
那是
that's...

772
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,000
那是钢铁侠吗
Is that Iron Man?

773
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,260
其实  我才是
Technically, I am.

774
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,970
其实  你已经死了
Technically, you're dead.

775
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,200
{\an8}满大人袭击  斯塔克据推测已死

776
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,120
有道理
A valid point.

777
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,710
他怎么了
What happened to him?

778
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:04,600
生活艰辛
Life.

779
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:06,950
我建造了他  我照顾他
I built him, I take care of him.

780
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:10,910
现在我要修好他
I'll fix him.

781
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,910
像机械师那样吗
Like a mechanic?

782
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:12,790
是的
Yeah.

783
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,840
如果是我在造钢铁侠和战争机器的话
If I was building Iron Man and War Machine...

784
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,000
现在叫钢铁爱国者了
It's Iron Patriot now.

785
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,330
这样酷多了
That's way cooler!

786
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:21,330
才不是
No, it's not.

787
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:26,030
好吧  是我的话就加上  那个逆...
Anyways, I would have added in um... the retro...

788
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,020
逆反射板吗
Retroreflective panels?

789
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,350
让他可以隐形
To make him stealth mode.

790
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:29,070
你想要隐形吗
You want a stealth mode?

791
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:29,720
多酷啊  不是吗
Cool, right?

792
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,830
这主意不错  也许我会造一套
That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.

793
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,910
这主意就不好了  你在干什么
Not a good idea! What are you doing?

794
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,170
你把他的手指掰下来了
You're gonna break his finger?

795
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,520
他很痛苦  他受伤了  别动他
He's in pain, he's been injured. Leave him alone.

00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:40,560

那个  谁在家
So, uh, who's home?

800
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,810
我妈妈出去吃饭了
Well, my mom already left for the diner

801
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,080
我爸去7/11买刮刮乐了
and dad went to 7-Eleven to get scratchers.

802
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:54,250
我猜他中奖了  因为那是六年前的事了
I guess he won, 'cause that was six years ago.

803
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,050
很正常  好多老爸都出走
Which happens, dads leave.

804
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,180

这是小孩玩的彩罐  开玩笑的

这是很厉害的武器  别对着自己

So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way.

那很自私也很愚蠢  以后再也不会了
That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again.

836
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,160
你今晚来家里干什么

837

你有什么如此重要的事非要跟托尼说

我觉得我的老板效力于满大人

我建议找个安全一点的地方谈

你觉得你的老板效力于满大人吗
Your boss works for the Mandarin, you think?

842
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,690
但托尼说你是个植物学家  那么
But Tony says you're a botanist, so...

843
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:15,940
难怪了  其实我是个

850
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,920
但是没有发现尸体
But there's no sign of a body.

851
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,110
-我明白了  -没找到斯塔克

852
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:37,310
我得挂了
I have to go.

三明治还行  弹簧有点生锈了
The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty,

863

剩下的材料  我能凑合着用
the rest of the materials, I'll make do.

864
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,110
对了  你说你妹妹有块手表时
By the way, when you said your sister had a watch,

865
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:48,660
我没想到会这么幼齿
I was kinda hoping for something a little more adult than that.

866
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,540
她才六岁  再说这是个限量版
She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition.

867
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,580
我们什么时候能聊聊纽约的事

可能永远不会  别去想了
Maybe never, relax about it.

00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:58,660
-能聊聊他们吗  -回头的吧
- can you talk about them? - I don't know, later.

871
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,560
孩子  让我喘口气
Hey kid, give me a little space.

872
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,620
官方说法是什么
What's the official story here?

873
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:07,670
怎么回事
What happened?

874
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:10,420
好像是个叫查德·戴维斯的人
I guess this guy named Chad Davis,

875
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,730
以前住在附近
used to live roundabouts,

876
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:15,610
在军队里获得了很多勋章
won a bunch of medals in the army.

877
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,060
有一天人们说他疯了
One day, folks said he went crazy

878
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,110
然后做了一个...炸弹
and made, you know, a bomb.

879
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,970
然后他在这里把自己炸飞了
Then he blew himself up right here.

880
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:30,740
死了六个人  对吗
Six people died, right?

881
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:31,270
是的
Yeah.

882
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:32,130
包括查德·戴维斯吗
Including Chad Davis?

883
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,120
是的
Yeah.

884
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,220
是吗  这没道理啊
Yeah. That doesn't make sense.

885
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,630
想想看  六个人死了  只有五个阴影
Think about it. Six dead, only five shadows.

886
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,480
人们说这些阴影

887
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,770
是升入天堂的灵魂的烙印
like the mark of souls gone to Heaven.

888
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,400
除了那个人弹
Except the bomb guy,

889
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,490
他没有阴影  所以他下了地狱
he went to Hell on account of he didn't get a shadow.

890
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,100
所以只有五个
That's why there's only five.

891
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,090
你信吗
Do you buy that?

892
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,450
大家都这么说的
That's what everyone says.

893
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,860
知道这个坑让我想起什么吗
You know what this crater reminds me of?

894
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:11,800
不知道  我不...我不在乎

那个巨大的虫洞  在纽约

你有同感吗
Does it remind you?

897
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:22,690
你这是想套话  我不想谈
That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.

898
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:24,820
他们会回来吗  那些外星人
Are they coming back? The aliens?

899
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,380
也许吧  你闭嘴行吗
Maybe. Can you stop?

900
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:28,470
记不记得我跟你说
Remember when I told you,

901
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:29,980

902
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,800
这个话题让你  焦躁吗
Does this subject make you...make you edgy?

903
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:32,500
是有一点
Yeah, a little bit.

904
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,210
能不能让我喘口气

玫瑰山有坏人吗
Are there bad guys in Rose Hills?

我可以闭嘴  你要我闭嘴吗
I can stop, do you want me to stop?

913
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:48,590
你要我闭嘴吗
Do you want me to stop?

914
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:49,410
记得我说过叫你闭嘴吗
Remember when I said to stop doing that?

915
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:51,340
上帝啊  你快把我弄崩溃了
I swear to God, you're going to freak me out!

916
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,650
你成功了  不是吗  现在开心了吧

都是你的错  你害我抓狂了
Your fault, you spazzed me out.

你想从哪说起
Where'd you like to start?

940

我只想说我为您丧子感到难过
I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss.

我想知道你觉得发生了什么
I want to know what you think happened.

942
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:46,040
我给你带来了资料  你拿了就走吧
Look, I brought your damn file. You take it and go.

943
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:49,990
无论里面是什么他都不想与之有任何瓜葛
Whatever was in here, he wanted no part of it.

944
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,810
{\an8}机密文件  查德·戴维斯

945
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,480

有人利用了他
Someone used him.

955
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:20,520
你说什么
What?

956
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,100
有人把他当做了武器
As a weapon.

957
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:30,300
你不是给我打电话的那个人  对吧
You're not the person who called me after all, are you?

958
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:32,690
其实  那是我
Actually, I am.

959
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:38,480
怎么回事
What's all this about?

960
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,110
发生了什么事
What the hell's going on here?

961
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:41,330
我在抓人
It's called an arrest.

962
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:43,980
是警长吧
Sheriff, is it?

963
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,980
没错  我是警长  你是谁
Yes, ma'am, it is. And you are?

964

有问题
No, we're not good.

967
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,690
你最好把来龙去脉讲清楚
I need a little more information than that.

968
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:54,190
恐怕你级别不够高  警长
Well, I think it's a little above your pay grade, Sheriff.

969
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,630
那你去联系下纳什维尔[田纳西首府]
Yeah, well, why don't you get on the horn to Nashville and uh...

970
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:57,760
给我升升级吧

971
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,320
好吧  你知道吗
Alright, you know what?

972
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,620
我本希望能和平解决的  但是
I was hoping to do this the smart way, but uh...

973
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,900
好玩的方法总是更奏效
the fun way's always good.

974
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,110
警官  把这个女人抓起来
Deputy, get this woman and...

975
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:22,620
辣妹  想玩玩吗  就你和我  走吧

你算是找对人了
You walked right into this one,

980
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,480
我泡过比你更火辣的妞
I've dated hotter chicks than you.

981
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:56,030
你就这点本事吗  耍花招说冷笑话
That's all you got? Cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?

982
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:58,770
亲爱的  我的自传可以起这个名字
Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography.

983
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:01,350
-放开我  -救命
- Let me go! - Help me!

984
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:02,350
救命
Help me!

985
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,170
好吧
Anyway.

986
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,550
孩子  你要想什么圣诞礼物
Hey kid, what would you like for Christmas?

00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:12,770
-斯塔克先生  对不起  -不不不
- Mr. Stark, I am so sorry! - No, no.

988
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:15,880
他想说的应该是  我要那份文件
I think he was trying to say 'I want my goddamn file.'

989
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:18,130
这不是你的错  孩子
It's not your fault, kid.

990
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:22,020
记得我说过被人欺负时该怎么做吗
Remember what I told you about bullies?

991
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:29,750
喜欢吗  乡巴佬
You like that, West World?

992
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:33,860
聪明人就这样  总有办法保护自己
That's the thing about smart guys, we always cover our ass.

993
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,630
不用谢
You're welcome!

994
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:02,810

998
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,850
别那么烦人  明白吗
don't be a yutz, alright?

999
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:13,580
淡定一点  不然会让人觉得浮夸
Just play it cool otherwise you come off grandiose.

1000
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:15,450
你就没这样吗
Unlike you?

1001
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:21,170
承认吧  你需要我  我们心有灵犀

待在电话附近
And stay connected to the telephone,

1005
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:29,320
我打给你  你就得接  好吗
because if I call, you better pick up. Okay?

1006
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:30,510
明白了吗
Can you feel that?

1007
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,050
别再跟着我了
We're done here.

1008
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,010
让开  不然从你身上碾过去
Move out of the way or I'm gonna run you over.

1009

你做得很好
You did good.

1012
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:48,660
你现在要像我爸那样丢下我吗
So now you're just gonna leave me here, like my dad?

1013
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:51,180
没错
Yeah.

1014
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:54,370
等等  你是在装可怜吗
Wait, you're guilt-tripping me, aren't you?

1015
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:55,660
我好冷
I'm cold.

1016
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,490
我看得出来  知道我为什么看得出来吗
I can tell. You know how I can tell?

1017
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,070
因为我们心有灵犀
Cause we're connected.

1018
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,490

1027

副总统先生  您得看看这个

1034
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,550
天啊  又来了

1035
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:52,870
总统也在看吗
Is the President getting this?

1036
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:07,680
总统先生  还剩最后两节课

01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:43,490
想想号码是怎么发过去的吧
Imagining how it got there.

1047

美国  如果你的总统在半分钟内打给我

1049
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,270
他怎么黑进我手机的
How did he hack my phone?

1050

我们不能对恐怖分子言听计从

你来找我了  你在干什么呢

1231
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:29,570
两三盆吧
Two or three bowls.

1232
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:31,300
你还能看清吗
Can you still see straight?

1233
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:32,500
差不多
Sort of.

1234
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,500
说明你没事  电话给贾维斯
That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis.

1235
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,390
贾维斯  情况怎么样
Jarvis, how are we?

1236
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:36,420
完全没问题  先生
It's totally fine, sir.

1237
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:37,760
有一段还不错
I seem to do quite well for a stretch

1238
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,010
但在句子结尾的时候
and then at the end of the sentence

1239
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:41,200
我说错了蔓越莓
I say the wrong cranberry.

1240
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,340
还有  先生  你是对的
And, sir, you were right.

1241
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:45,030
我把AIM下行设施考虑进去后
Once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities,

1242
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:47,820
就定位到了满大人的广播信号
I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal.

1243
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:48,950
大概在哪里  远东  欧洲
What're we talkin'? Far East, Europe,

1244
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:52,140
北非  伊朗  巴基斯坦  叙利亚  在哪
North Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria, where is it?

1245
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:54,030
实际上  先生  在迈阿密
Actually, sir, it's in Miami.

1246
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:54,700
好的
Okay.

1247
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,410
孩子  我得一步步教你
Kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through

1248
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,840
重启贾维斯的语音驱动
rebooting Jarvis' speech drive,

1249
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,590
不过现在不行
but not right now.

1250
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,790
哈里  他到底在哪
Harley, where is he really?

1251
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:02,770
看一下屏幕  告诉我位置
Just look on the screen and tell me where it is.

1252
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:06,240
显示的就是佛罗里达迈阿密
It does say Miami, Florida

1253
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:08,460
好  先说重要的  我需要战衣
Okay, first things first, i need the armor.

1254
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:09,490
它现在怎么样了
Where are we at with it?

1255
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:11,100
充不了电
It's not charging.

1256
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,050
实际上  先生  是在充电
Actually, sir, it's charging,

1257
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:21,390
不过电源有问题
but the power source is questionable.

1258
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:23,850
可能无法使马克42型恢复动力
It may not succeed in revitalizing the Mark 42.

1259
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:25,500
电源有什么问题
What's questionable about electricity?

1260
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,210
好吧  这是我的战衣
Alright, it's my suit

1261
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:28,680
我不能...我不要...
and I can't... I'm not gonna...

1262
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:29,890
我不想
I don't wanna...

1263
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:33,070
-老天  又来了  -托尼
- Oh God, not again. - Tony?

1264
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,610
你又发作了吗
Are you having another attack?

1265
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:39,200
我都没提到纽约呢
I didn't even mention New York.

1266
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,020
好吧  你刚刚说出来了
Right, and then you just said it, by name,

1267
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,850
你还说你没说
while denying having said it!

1268
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:43,990
好吧
Okay...

1269
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:48,040
天啊  我怎么办
Oh, God. What am I gonna do?

1270
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,920
深呼吸  真的  深呼吸
Just breathe. Really, just breathe.

1271
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:53,510
你是机械师  对吧
You're a mechanic, right?

1272
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:55,400
对
Right.

1273
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,780
你是这么说的
You said so.

1274
01:11:58,890 --> 01:11:59,950
对  没错
Yes, I did.

1275
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,080
那你为什么不造点东西呢
Why don't you just build something?

1276
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:16,530
好
Okay,

1277
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:18,800

1282
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:07,450
我说了要调到20度
I told you to put it at sixty-eight.

1283
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:09,970
又是我的错  告诉你  亲爱的
My fault again. Let me tell you something sweetheart,

1284
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:11,600
我不是你的个人
I am not your personal...

1285
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:12,800
好吧

They're made by Americans,

根据日本食谱做的
based on...based on the Japanese recipes.

1294
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:38,390
完蛋了  完蛋了
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

1295
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:39,560

我没动  你想要什么就拿走吧

不过这些枪都是假的
although the guns are all fake

1298
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:44,900
因为那些贱人不相信我  不肯给真的
because those wankers wouldn't trust me with the real ones.

1299
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:45,430

真的满大人  他在哪
The Mandarin, the real guy, where?!

1303
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:55,820
满大人在哪  他在哪
Where's the Mandarin?! Where is he?!

1304
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,220
他就在这  就在这

1305
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,080
但又不在这  他在这  又不在这

1308
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:04,570
很复杂
It's complicated.

1309
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:06,140
那就说清楚  女士请出去
Uncomplicate it. Ladies out.

01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:23,320
我叫特雷夫  特雷夫·斯拉特里
My name is Trevor, Trevor Slattery.

1313
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:25,640
你是什么人
What are you?

1314
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,050
幌子吗  你是个替身吧
What're you a decoy? You're a double, right?

1315
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:30,470
什么  就像替补演员吗  当然不是
What? Like an understudy? No, absolutely not.

1316

别打脸  我是个演员
Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.

1317
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,810
你还剩一分钟的命  好好说
You got a minute to live, fill it with words.

1318
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:38,210
只是个角色
Just a role.

1319
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:41,230
满大人  是虚构出来的
'The Mandarin', see, it's not real.

1320
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:43,040
那你是怎么到这的  特雷夫
Then how did you get here, Trevor?

1321
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:50,430
我有点小毛病
I um... I have a little problem with,

1322
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:53,160
滥用药物什么的  结果
substances, and I ended up,

1323
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,900
我做了些没办法的事
doing things, no two ways about it.

1324

街头交易  男人不该做的事
In the street that a man shouldn't do.

1326
01:16:58,890 --> 01:17:00,290
然后
And then,

1327
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:02,980
他们找到了我来扮演这个角色
they approached me about the role

1328
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:04,440
他们也知道毒品的事
and they knew about the drugs.

1329
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,640
他们怎么说的  帮你戒掉吗
What did they say they'd get you off 'em?

1330
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,400
他们说会给我更多
Said they'd give me more.

1331
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:10,090
他们给了我很多东西  给了我这座宫殿

1332
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:14,010
给我整了容  给了我好多东西
They gave me plastic surgery. They gave me things.

1333
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,940
你是睡着了吗
Did you just nod off?

1334
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,540
没有  还有一艘不错的快艇
No! And a lovely speedboat!

1335
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:20,780
条件就是
And the thing was,

1336
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:22,320
他需要个人
he needed someone

1337
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:26,320
为一些"意外爆炸"负责
to take credit for some 'accidental explosions'.

1338
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:30,640
他
He?

1339
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:35,270
-基里安吗  -基里安
- Killian? - Killian.

1340
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,030
-他编造了你  -他编造了我
- He created you? - He created me.

1341
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:40,380
量身定制的恐怖威胁
Custom-made terror threat.

1342
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,360
没错  没错
Yes! Yes!

1343
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,150
是他的智囊团想出来的
His think tank thinked it up,

1344
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,150
连环杀手的病态心理
the pathology of the serial killer.

1345
01:17:47,150 --> 01:17:50,610
利用了西方肖象学
The manipulation of Western iconography.

1346
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:55,170
准备好再上一课了吗  诸如此类的
Ready for another lesson? Blah blah blah.

1347
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:59,930
当然了  我的表演让这满大人栩栩如生
Of course, it was my performance that brought the Mandarin to life.

1348
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,130
你的表演
Your performance?

1349
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:03,430
还杀人呢
Where people die?

1350
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:04,860
他们没死
No, they didn't.

1351
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:06,640
看看这一切啊
Look around you,

1352
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,790
服装  绿幕
costumes, green screen.

1353
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:11,310
说实话  片子里一半的戏我都没到场
Oh, honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff.

1354
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:13,460
有我的时候  是电影特效嘛  亲爱的
When I was, it was movie magic, love.

1355
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:15,320
抱歉  不过我有个铁哥们正在昏迷中
I'm sorry,  but I got a best friend who's in a coma

1356
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,990
也许醒不过来了
and he might not wake up.

1357
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:18,220
所以你得为此负责
So you're gonna have to answer for that.

1358
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:20,590
你还是要付出代价  哥们  你明...
You're still going down, pal. You under...

1359
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:30,540
好了  特雷夫  你跟他说什么了
Okay, Trevor, what'd you tell him?

1360
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:31,560
我什么都没说
I didn't tell him anything.

1361
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:32,710
什么都没说
Nothing?

1362
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:34,750
没有
No.

1363
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:36,730
你该按应急按钮的
You should've pressed the panic button.

1364
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:39,470
我是急了会儿  但我应付下来了
Well I panicked, but then I handled it.

1365
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:53,420
好吧
Okay.

1366
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:03,980
就跟以前一样  对吧
Just like old times, huh?

1367
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:06,820
对  束线带绑着  真好玩
Oh yeah, with zip-ties. It's a ball.

1368
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,940
那不是我的主意
It wasn't my idea.

1369
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:10,940
看来你真收下了基里安的名片
Okay, so you took Killian's card.

1370
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:11,980
我拿了他的钱
I took his money.

1371
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:14,570
然后13年后  你困在这个地牢里
And here you are, thirteen years later in a dungeon.

1372
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:15,380
不是
No.

1373
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:16,470
是的
Yeah.

1374
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:18,980
不是  是你困在地牢里  我想走就能走
No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.

1375
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:19,930
好吧
Yeah.

1376
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:27,850
发生了很多事  托尼  不过我快成功了
A lot's happened, Tony, but I'm close.

1377
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:30,770
绝境病毒已经很稳定了
Extremis is practically stable.

1378
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:32,270
相信我它并没有
I'm telling you it isn't!

1379
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:33,700
我去街上看过  很多人都爆炸了
I'm on the street, people are going 'bang',

1380
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,990
溅了一墙血  玛雅  你是在欺骗自己
they're painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself.

1381
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:37,690
那就帮我修好它
Then help me fix it.

1382
01:19:39,130 --> 01:19:40,670
{\an8}你知道我是谁

1383
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:43,830
这是我写的
Did I do that?

1384
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:46,490
对
Yes.

1385
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,360
我记得那天晚上  但不记得早上了
I remember the night, not the morning.

1386
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:50,170
你就是为了这个吗
Is this what you've been chasing around?

1387
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:50,980
你不记得了
You don't remember?

1388
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:52,070
帮不了你
I can't help you.

1389
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:57,160
你以前是有道德心
You used to have a moral psychology.

1390
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:58,930
有理想
You used to have ideals.

1391
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,180
你想帮助别人
You wanted to help people,

1392
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,180
看看你现在
now look at you.

1393
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:07,240
现在每天早上陪我醒来的人
I get to wake up every morning with someone who...

1394
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,540
是有灵魂的
still has her soul.

1395
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:18,800
帮我出去
Get me out of here.

1396
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:22,300
拜托了
Come on.

1397
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:25,970
你知道我老爸以前是怎么跟我说的吗
You know what my old man used to say to me?

1398
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:29,350
他最喜欢说的一句话是
One of his favorite of many sayings,

1399
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:31,930
早起的鸟儿有虫吃
'The early bird gets the worm,

1400
01:20:31,930 --> 01:20:34,480
但是第二只老鼠有奶酪吃
but the second mouse gets the cheese.'

1401
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,740
你不是还在为瑞士的事生气吧
You're not still pissed about the Switzerland thing, are you?

1402
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:38,700
我怎么能生你的气呢  托尼
How can I be pissed at you, Tony?

1403
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:40,550
我是来感谢你的
I'm here to thank you.

1404
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:44,010
你送了我一份这辈子最棒的礼物
You gave me the greatest gift that anybody's ever given me.

1405
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,550
绝望
Desperation.

1406
01:20:46,450 --> 01:20:48,020
回想一下在瑞士的时候
If you think back to Switzerland,

1407
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:50,160
你说会去楼顶找我  是吧
you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right?

1408
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:54,620
头二十分钟
Well for the first twenty minutes,

1409
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:56,210
我真以为你会来
I actually thought you'd show up.

1410
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:58,440
接下来的一小时里
And the next hour, I...

1411
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:01,410
我考虑着
well I considered taking that

1412
01:21:01,410 --> 01:21:04,130
跨出一步  走近路去大堂
one step shortcut to the lobby,

1413
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:06,230
你明白我的意思吗
if you know what I mean.

1414
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:07,600
坦白说  我还在想
Honestly, I'm still trying to

1415
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,780
第一只老鼠发生了什么事
figure out what happened to the first mouse.

1416
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:12,300
不过当我俯瞰那座城市时
But as I looked out over that city,

1417
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:13,720
没人知道我在那里
nobody knew I was there,

1418
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:16,270
没人看得见我  甚至没人在看
nobody could see me, no one was even looking.

1419
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:20,960
我冒出了一个今后引导了我多年的想法
I had a thought that would guide me for years to come.

1420
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,220
就是隐姓埋名  托尼
Anonymity, Tony.

1421
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:27,180
多亏了你  这从此成了我的准则  对吧
Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since, right?

1422
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:30,160
你只需要在幕后运筹帷幄
You simply rule from behind the scenes.

1423
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,690
因为一旦你赋予了邪恶一副面孔
Because the second you give evil a face,

1424
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:36,190
本·拉登  卡扎菲  或是满大人
a Bin Laden, a Gaddafi, The Mandarin,

1425
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:37,610
你就给了人们一个靶子
you hand the people a target.

1426
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:38,830
你真不是一般人
You're something else.

1427
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:42,580
你已经见过他了吧
You have met him, I assume?

1428
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:44,250
是啊  影帝先生
Yeah, Sir Lawrence Olivier.

1429
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:46,450
我知道他有时候有点夸张
I know he's a little over the top sometimes.

1430
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:47,800
这不能怪我
It's not entirely my fault,

1431
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,630
他比较...他是个舞台剧演员
he has a tend...he's a stage actor.

1432
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:53,750
据说他演的李尔王在克罗伊登很受欢迎  管他呢
They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.

1433
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,830
总之  重点是
Anyway, the point is,

1434
01:21:55,830 --> 01:21:59,110
自从那个拿锤子的大块头从天而降之后
ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky,

1435
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:01,230
低调就不流行了
subtlety's kinda had its day.

1436
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:02,660
你接下来打算做什么
What's next for you in your world?

1437
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:04,690
我想回馈给你
Well, I wanted to repay you

1438
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:07,920
你曾慷慨给予我的东西
with the same gift that you so graciously imparted to me.

1439
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:16,070
绝望
Desperation.

1440
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,090
这是直播
Now, this is live.

1441
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:19,640
我不确定你是否了解状况
I'm not sure if you can tell,

1442
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,970
此刻她的身体正在试图决定
but at this moment the body is trying to decide

1443
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:25,920
是接受绝境病毒还是直接放弃
whether to accept Extremis or just give up.

1444
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,900
如果她放弃了  我只能说那场面
And if it gives up, I have to say the denotation is...

1445
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:32,580
是相当震撼的
it's quite spectacular.

1446
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:36,670
不过在做出决定之前  只有巨大的痛苦
But until that point, it's really just a lot of pain.

1447
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:41,110
我们还没讨论过薪酬呢
We haven't even talked salary yet.

1448
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:45,310
你还想要什么福利
What kind of perk package are you thinking of? Hm?

1449
01:22:45,310 --> 01:22:46,320
放开他
Let him go.

1450
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:48,820
稍等  稍等
Hold on, hold on.

1451
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:50,470
玛雅
Maya...

1452
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:52,240
我说了放了他
I said let him go!

1453
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,620
你在做什么
What are you doing?

1454
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:58,280
1200毫升  只要一半剂量就够致死了
1200cc's, a dose half of this size, I'm dead.

1455
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:02,600
总有人考验我的耐心
It's times like these my temper is tested somewhat.

1456
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,120
玛雅  把注射器给我
Maya, give me the injector.

1457
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:08,500
基里安  我要是死了你的士兵们会怎样
If I die, Killian, what happens to your soldiers?

1458
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,640
你的产品又会怎样
What happens to your product?

1459
01:23:09,650 --> 01:23:10,840
我们用不着这样  好吗
We're not doing this, okay?

1460
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:13,850
你自己会怎样  要是你过热了怎么办
What happens to you? What happens if you go too hot?

1461
01:23:26,470 --> 01:23:30,980
好消息是  高层现在有一个空职了
The good news is, a high level position has just been vacated.

1462
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:41,620
你就是个疯子
You're a maniac.

1463
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:43,250
错  我是个远见家
No, I'm a visionary.

1464
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:45,800
但我手下的确有个疯子
But I do own a maniac,

1465
01:23:46,530 --> 01:23:48,570
今晚就看他的表演了
and he takes the stage tonight.

1466
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:54,000
一旦钢铁爱国者成功登机
Once we get the Patriot installed,

1467
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,790
我只要九到十分钟就能搞定
it'll take me nine...ten minutes for a take down.

1468
01:23:57,370 --> 01:23:58,090
那太好了
Well, that's great.

1469
01:23:58,090 --> 01:24:00,370
但是上一次看到它里面还有人呢
But the last time I looked there was somebody inside of it.

1470
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:07,690
下午好  先生们
Afternoon, gentlemen.

1471
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:11,980
你好  上校
Hello, Colonel.

1472
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:14,660
都让开
Step aside.

1473
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,460
我们会让你出来的  别担心
We'll get you out of there, don't worry.

1474
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,200
这样会破坏战甲的
You'll damage the armor.

1475
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:29,740
是啊
Yes, I will.

1476
01:24:31,230 --> 01:24:32,590
但你会修好的  对吗
But you can fix it, right?

1477
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:35,790
我要带战衣去基地
I'm gonna take the suit up to base camp,

1478
01:24:35,790 --> 01:24:37,420
波茨也跟我一起去
and I want Potts with me.

1479
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,080
她还在第二阶段
She's still in Phase 2.

1480
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:41,970
你听不懂我说的话吗
You're not going deaf, are you?

1481
01:24:58,070 --> 01:25:00,150
小心点  那可是限量版
Careful there, it's a limited edition.

1482
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,620
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}恶搞小马快递  一种桌游

1483
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,620
小马尾快递
Ponytail Express.

1484
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,580
田纳西离迈阿密有多远
What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?

1485
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:06,860
832英里
Eight hundred and thirty-two miles.

1486
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:08,020
非常好
Very nice.

1487
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:09,290
我比较擅长这个
I'm good like that.

1488
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:11,660
你能  把那玩意儿停掉吗
Can you, uh...stop that?

1489
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:12,870
弄坏了你就赔
Break it, you bought it!

1490
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:16,210
我赔就是了
I think I bought it.

1491
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:17,340
那可不是我的
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away.

1492
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:18,780
是我朋友的妹妹的
That belongs to my friend's sister,

1493
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:22,670
所以我等会要先杀你
and that's why I'm gonna kill you first.

1494
01:25:22,670 --> 01:25:23,960
-你要怎么杀我  -等着瞧吧
- What're you gonna do to me? - You'll see.

1495
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:25,810
你现在被绑在一张床上
You're zip-tied to a bed.

1496
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:27,270
像这样
This.

1497
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:31,930
像那样
That.

1498
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,050
你打算出来了吗
Are you comin' out?

1499
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:41,890
不要打开  不要打开
Do not open, do not open!

1500
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:43,600
别打开  别打开  别
Don't open, don't open, don't...!

1501
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,800
那还是出去吧
Alright, let's go.

1502
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:54,070
你还能喷火
You...you breathe fire?

1503
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:55,460
好吧
Okay.

1504

真是美妙的一天  萨文
It's a glorious day, Savin.

整个西方最有权力的领导人

以及最可怕的恐怖分子都会在我手里
and the world's most feared terrorist in the other.

1508

五  四  三  拜托  二

1514
01:26:31,310 --> 01:26:32,580
我们怎么会摊上这个傻逼
How did we get this shit?

1515

我给你们个机会现在就逃
Alright, I'm gonna give you a chance to escape.

1516

放下武器

把自己绑在椅子上
tie yourselves to those chairs,

我就不杀你们  还有五  四
I'll let you live. In five, four...bang!

你们应该死了
You should be gone by now,

1521
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,170
这会就该上西天了才对
you should have already been gone.

1522
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:45,910
我真是要吓尿了
I am just beyond terrified.

1523
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,160
来了  三  四
Here it comes. Three, four...

1524
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:50,050

五  四  三  二  一
Five, four, three, two, one!

1526
01:26:52,650 --> 01:26:53,520
早跟你说了
Told ya.

1527
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:06,990
剩下的部分呢
Where's the rest?

1528
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:07,320
说实话  我讨厌在这工作
Honestly, I hate working here.

1529
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,720
他们是群怪胎
They are so weird.

1530
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:15,960
晚了总比不来好
Ah, better late than never.

1531
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:24,080
这次不要  别撞脸
Not this time. Not the face.

1532
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,670
回来真好  对了  你好
Phew, it's good to be back. Hello, by the way.

1533
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:29,000
你好  先生
Oh, hello sir.

1534
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:33,700
{\an8}钢铁爱国者

1535
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:35,560
全体注意  斯塔克已逃脱
All personnel, Stark is loose

1536
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,780
正在院子里某处
and somewhere in the compound.

1537
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:37,870
重复  斯塔克已逃脱
Repeat, Stark is loose

1538
01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:39,370
正在院子里某处
and somewhere in the compound.

1539
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:40,500
我们走吧
Let's go.

1540
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:42,810
该死
Ah, crap.

1541
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,430
托尼
Tony...

1542
01:28:56,490 --> 01:28:58,020
罗德  那是你穿着战衣吧
Rudy, tell me that was you in the suit.

1543
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:00,270
不是  你拿到你的了吗
No. You got yours?

1544
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:02,350
算是吧  尽快赶到主屋去
Kind of. Main house as fast as you can.

1545
01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:03,700
我要介绍个人给你认识
Somebody I'd like you to meet.

1546
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:11,380
你  你  还有你  出去  快滚
You, you, move! Get out!

1547
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:14,110
房间安全  已看到满大人
The room is secure. I have eyes on the Mandarin.

1548
01:29:14,110 --> 01:29:15,610
这是什么  我赢了
What's this? I had winner's.

1549
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:24,820
你扮成了什么
What've you come as?

1550
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:27,690
你敢动一下我就打爆你的脸
You make a move and I'll break your face.

1551
01:29:28,630 --> 01:29:32,190
我从来不知道有人受了伤  他们骗了我
I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.

1552
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:33,760
这就是满大人
This is the Mandarin?

1553
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,870
我知道  这...太丢人了
I know, it's...it's...it's embarrassing.

1554
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,840
我是特雷夫  特雷夫·斯拉特里
Hi, Trevor. Trevor...Slattery.

1555
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,760
我知道  我本人有点矮  有点瘦
I know, I'm shorter in person, bit small,

1556
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,450
每个人都这么说  但是
everyone says that. But...

1557
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:43,040
如果你们是来抓我的
if you're here to arrest me,

1558
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,870
我乐意马上供出一些人来
there are some people who I'd like to roll on. Immediately.

1559
01:29:44,870 --> 01:29:46,230
我来跟你说明下状况  梅姨
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.

1560
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:49,050
你告诉他派珀在哪  我才会停下
You tell him where Pepper is and I'll stop doin' it.

1561
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:49,900
停下什么
Doing what?

1562
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:52,500
我懂了  好疼  我懂了  我懂了
Oh, I get it! Ow! That hurt! I get it! I get it!

1563
01:29:52,510 --> 01:29:54,280
我不知道派珀是谁
I don't know about any Pepper,

1564
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:56,740
-但我知道他们的计划  -快说
- but I know about the plan. - Spill.

1565
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:58,900
你知道他们把我的战衣怎么了吗
Do you know what they did to my suit?

1566
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:02,110
什么  不  但我知道地点是在海岸
What? No. But I do know what's happening off the coast.

1567
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:05,630
跟一艘大船有关
Something to do with uh...A big boat.

1568
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:06,790
我可以带你们过去
I can take you there.

1569
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:12,730
托尼  我发誓  我一定要打烂他的脸
Tony, I swear to God. I'm gonna blow his face off.

1570
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:16,560
而且这事还跟副总统有关系
Oh, this next bit may include the Vice President as well.

1571
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:18,490
这个重要吗
Is that...is that important?

1572
01:30:18,490 --> 01:30:19,160
算是吧
Somewhat.

1573
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:20,400
挺重要的
Yeah, a little bit.

1574
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:24,440
怎么样
So?

1575
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:27,790
我们怎么办  没有交通工具
What are we gonna do? I mean, we don't have any transport.

1576
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:34,110
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}披头士成员之一

1577
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:34,110
林戈  你是不是提过有一艘不错的快艇
Ringo. Didn't you say something about a 'lovely speedboat'?

1578
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:37,320
如果他说的地点没错
If he's right about the location,

1579
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,740
我们离派珀还有20分钟的路程
we're twenty minutes from where Pepper is.

1580
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:40,890
但我们还得搞清楚副总统的事  对吧
But we also have to figure out this Vice President thing, right?

1581
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:42,910
没错  猜我正在打给谁
Right. I wonder who I'm calling right now?

1582
01:30:42,910 --> 01:30:44,310
是副总统
Oh, that's the Vice President.

1583
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:45,330
谢谢
Thanks.

1584
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:47,510
你好
Hello.

1585
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:49,550
我是托尼·斯塔克
Sir, this is Tony Stark.

1586
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:51,280
欢迎回到人间
Welcome back to the land of the living.

1587
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,010
我们有理由相信
We believe you're about to be

1588
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:53,430
您可能会被卷入满大人的袭击事件
drawn into the Mandarin campaign,

1589
01:30:53,430 --> 01:30:55,420
我们得尽快将您转移到安全地点
and we gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.

1590
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:57,760
斯塔克先生  我正准备在精英特工的保护下
Mr. Stark, I'm about to eat honey roast ham

1591
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,270
享用蜜汁火腿
surrounded by the agency's finest.

1592
01:31:00,270 --> 01:31:03,780
而总统和罗德上校在空军一号上
The President's safe on Air Force One with Colonel Rhodes,

1593
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:04,680
我认为我们都很安全
I think we're good here.

1594
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:06,930
先生  我是罗德上校
Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes!

1595
01:31:06,930 --> 01:31:09,270
他们打算用钢铁爱国者做木马
They're using the Iron Patriot as a Trojan Horse,

1596
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:10,600
想办法干掉总统
they're gonna take out the President somehow.

1597
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,340
我们得立刻警告机组
We have to immediately alert that plane.

1598
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:14,450
好的  我会让安保人员马上行动
Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security lock it down.

1599
01:31:14,450 --> 01:31:17,650
如果情况需要  F22战机30秒内就能就位
If need be, they can have F22s in the air in thirty seconds.

1600
01:31:17,650 --> 01:31:18,360
谢谢你  上校
Thank you, Colonel.

1601
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:19,660
罗德和斯塔克结束通话
Rhodes and Stark out.

1602
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,580
没什么问题吧  先生
Everything okay, sir?

1603
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:25,060
完全没有
Couldn't be better.

1604
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,000
我爱你  宝贝
I love you, baby.

1605
01:31:53,890 --> 01:31:57,100
罗德上校  你能过来真是太好了
Colonel Rhodes. Glad to see you could make it, son.

1606
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,470
我这就感觉安全多了
I feel safer already.

1607
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:04,610
我们得做个决定
We gotta make a decision.

1608
01:32:04,610 --> 01:32:06,780
总统和派珀只能救其一
We can either save the President or Pepper.

1609
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:07,430
没法同时救两边
We can't do both.

1610
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:09,420
先生  马里布那边有新情况
Sir, I have an update from Malibu.

1611
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:11,110
起重机总算到达了现场
The cranes have finally arrived

1612
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:13,900
正在清理地下室入口
and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak.

1613
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:15,370
我身上的战衣现在什么状态
And what about the suit I'm wearing?

1614
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:17,640
能量已经充到92%了
The armor is now at ninety-two percent.

1615
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:19,570
也只能凑合用了
That's gonna have to do.

1616
01:32:28,730 --> 01:32:30,430
他过来了  他过来了  给我来张合照
Oh, here he comes, here he comes, get a quick picture.

1617
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:31,400
没问题
Sure.

1618
01:32:48,990 --> 01:32:50,420
一切正常吧  上校
Everything all right, Colonel?

1619
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,750
真是荣幸啊  总统先生
It is an honor, Mr. President.

1620
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:27,330
你要动手  就动手吧
If you're gonna do it, do it.

1621
01:33:27,330 --> 01:33:29,490
别着急啊  先生
Cool your boots, sir.

1622
01:33:29,490 --> 01:33:31,110
这可不是满大人的作风
That's not how the Mandarin works.

1623
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:33,790
长官  空军一号陷入危急状态
Sir, Air Force One's been compromised.

1624
01:33:33,790 --> 01:33:35,710
内部发生射击  温度骤升
Internal shots, temperature spikes.

1625
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:37,000
快把画面调出来
Get me eyes on it now.

1626
01:33:37,150 --> 01:33:38,710
画面出来了  长官
Image coming through now, sir.

1627
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:42,700
那是罗德吗
Was that Rhodes?

1628
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,150
总统呢
The President.

1629
01:34:14,410 --> 01:34:15,380
快说
Now.

1630
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:16,690
他不在这里
He's not here.

1631
01:34:20,690 --> 01:34:22,040
去享受喷流吧
Try the jet stream.

1632
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:25,610
说到气流  去捞鱼吧
Speaking of which, go fish!

1633
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,400
看这个伤口还愈合得了吗  狗娘养的
Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.

1634
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:04,970
下面有多少人
How many in the air?

1635
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:06,450
13个  先生
Thirteen, sir.

1636
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:08,670
我一次能带几个
How many can I carry?

1637
01:35:08,670 --> 01:35:09,930
四个  先生
Four, sir.

1638
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:21,620
慢点  慢点  放松  你叫什么
Slow down, slow down. Relax, what's your name?

1639
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:22,670
希瑟
Heather...

1640
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:33,430
听我说  看到那个人了吗
Listen to me. See that guy?

1641
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:35,720
我会飞过去  然后你抓住他
I'm gonna swing by and you're just gonna grab him.

1642
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:37,050
-明白了吗  -什么
- You got it?  - What?

1643
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:41,220
我会让你的手臂通上电
I will electrify your arm,

1644
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:43,310
这样你就松不开手了
you won't be able to open your hand.

1645
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:45,610
你能做到的  希瑟
You can do this, Heather.

1646
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:56,610
简单吧  还有11个
Easy, see? Eleven more to go.

1647
01:35:59,730 --> 01:36:02,030
记不记得有个叫猴子冒险的游戏
Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys?

1648
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:02,790
我们就那么玩
That's what we're gonna do.

1649
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:04,560
高度一万八千英尺
Eighteen thousand feet.

1650
01:36:04,570 --> 01:36:06,540
大家加油  每个人都抓好自己的猴子
Come on, people! Everybody, grab your monkey!

1651
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:11,860
漂亮
Nice!

1652
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,190
一万英尺
Ten thousdand feet.

1653
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:18,920
六千英尺
Six thousand feet.

1654
01:36:18,930 --> 01:36:19,970
大家加油
Come on, people.

1655
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:22,340
加油  加油  加油
Come on, come on, come on!

1656
01:36:27,810 --> 01:36:29,090
一千英尺
One thousand feet.

1657
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:31,620
四百英尺
Four hundred feet.

1658
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:33,500
两百英尺
Two hundred feet, sir.

1659
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:35,110
是只胖猴子  抓住他
It's a chunky monkey, let's get him.

1660
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:36,750
你好
Hello.

1661
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:01,800
干得漂亮
Nice work, guys.

1662
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:04,730
太棒了  大家配合得很好
Excellent. Good team effort all around. Go us.

1663
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:06,500
贾维斯  这才算完成一半
Alright, Jarvis, but it's only half done,

1664
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:07,900
我们还得去找派珀
we still gotta get Pepp...

1665
01:37:15,310 --> 01:37:16,650
从哪冒出来的
That came out of nowhere.

1666
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:19,950
跟我说点好消息
Give me some good news, man.

1667
01:37:19,950 --> 01:37:20,770
全部获救了
I think they all made it.

1668
01:37:20,770 --> 01:37:21,800
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

1669
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,640
但是总统被抓走了
Yeah, but I missed the President.

1670
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:25,170
你有战衣都救不了总统
You couldn't save the President with the suit,

1671
01:37:25,170 --> 01:37:27,160
我们什么都没有怎么救派珀
how are we gonna save Pepper with nothing?

1672
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:29,580
贾维斯  时间到了吗
Say, Jarvis, is it that time?

1673
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:31,680
是家庭聚会规程吗  先生
The 'house party' protocol, sir?

1674
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:32,750
没错
Correct.

1675
01:38:11,950 --> 01:38:13,410
你以为他会帮你吗
You think he's gonna help you...

1676
01:38:14,990 --> 01:38:16,050
不可能

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,060
这怎么重要了
How is that a priority?

47
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,590
怪奎尔啊 是他那么爱听歌
Blame Quill. He's the one who loves music so much.

48
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,570
不 其实我同意德拉克斯
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.

49
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,560
现在那个可不重要
That's hardly important right now.

50
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,620
好吧 好啊 奎尔
Okay. Sure, Quill.

51
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,730
不 认真的 我同意德拉克斯
No, seriously, I side with Drax.

52
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,270
我懂 你现在非常认真
No, I understand that. You're being very serious right now.

53
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,630
我能清楚看见你在眨眼
I can clearly see you winking.

54
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,070
该死 我眨的是左眼吗
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

55
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,420
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

56
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,760
他们没斜眼看你
They were not looking at you funny.

57
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,860
要动真格的了
Well, that's intense.

58
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,830
银河护卫队2

59
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:27,980
格鲁特
Groot!

60
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,690
格鲁特 快闪开 你会受伤的
Groot, get out of the way! You're gonna get hurt!

61
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,010
不不 快吐出来
No! No! Spit it out!

62
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:32,760
快点
Come on!

63
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,330
真恶心
Disgusting!

64
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,230
这怪物的皮太厚了 从外面刺不穿
The beast's hide is too thick to be pierced from the outside.

65
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,740
必须从里面切穿它
I must cut through it from the inside.

66
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,000
不不 德拉克斯 等等
No, no! Drax, wait a minute!

67
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,140
德拉克斯
Drax!

68
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,160
他干什么
What is he doing?

69
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,950
他说皮太厚了
He said the skin is too thick

70
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,290
从外面刺不穿 所以他
to be pierced from the outside, so he...

71
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,010
- 这根本没道理  - 我想告诉他来着
- That doesn't make any sense!  - I tried telling him that!

72
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,200
它的皮不管内外
Skin is the same level of thickness

73
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,790
都一样厚
from the inside as from the outside!

74
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,400
我意识到了
I realize that.

75
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,940
它脖子上有个切口
There is a cut on its neck.

76
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,940
火箭 让它抬头
Rocket, get it to look up.

77
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,890
你个大海猴子 看上面
Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey! Up here!

78
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,090
小心 奎尔
Watch it, Quill!

79
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,010
太棒了 我一个人打败了这头怪物
Yes! I have single-handedly vanquished the beast!

80
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,180
怎么了
What?

81
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,740
它们叫什么来着
What are they called again?

82
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,830
能量电池
Anulax batteries.

83
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,090
棱酿电池
Harbulary batteries.

84
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,450
跟我说的完全不搭边
That's nothing like what I just said.

85
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,190
但它们每个都值几万块
But they're worth thousands of units apiece

86
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,640
所以索维林族雇我们保护它们
which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them.

87
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,870
跟这些人打交道小心措辞 他们很容易生气
Careful what you say around these folks. They're easily offended.

88
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,820
冒犯了他们会被处死
The cost of transgression is death.

89
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:01,740
我们感谢你们拿生命冒险 银河护卫队
We thank you, Guardians, for putting your lives on the line.

90
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,080
我们不能让索维林子民去冒生命危险
We could not risk the lives of our own Sovereign citizens.

91
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,290
每个人都完全是按照族群的设计诞生的
Every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community.

92
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,830
身体和头脑都完美无缺
Impeccable, both physically and mentally.

93
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,080
我们控制后代的DNA
We control the DNA of our progeny...

94
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,480
让他们在生育荚里发育
germinating them in birthing pods.

95
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,420
我更喜欢用传统办法造人
I guess I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way.

96
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,360
也许哪天你可以给我讲讲历史
Perhaps someday, you could give me a history lesson...

97
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,170
讲讲我们祖先古老的方法
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.

98
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,990
为了学术研究
For academic purposes.

99
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,910
我很荣幸 好的
I would be honored, yes.

100
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,480
以学术研究的名义
In the name of research...

101
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,290
我觉得那会非常
I think that could be pretty...

102
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,680
非常令人反感
pretty repulsive.

103
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,420
我不喜欢随便…
I'm not into that kind of casual...

104
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,600
行了
Oh, please.

105
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,130
你们答应我们出力会有报酬的
Your people promised something in exchange for our services.

106
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,700
拿出来 我们马上就走
Bring it and we shall gladly be on our way.

107
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,700
家人团聚
Family reunion.

108
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,200
我知道她是你妹妹
I understand she is your sister.

109
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,380
她对我来说 只值山达尔的悬赏而已
She's worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar.

110
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,110
她想盗窃电池 被我们的士兵抓了个正着
Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries.

111
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,690
请随意处置她吧
Do with her as you please.

112
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,080
我们非常感谢您 阿耶莎大祭司
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.

113
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,260
你是什么出身 奎尔先生
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

114
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,160
我母亲来自地球
My mother is from Earth.

115
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,850
你父亲呢
And your father?

116
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,550
他不是密苏里人 我只知道这些
He ain't from Missouri. That's all I know.

117
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,640
我在你身上看到了
I see it within you.

118
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,780
一种不同寻常的血统
An unorthodox genealogy.

119
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,270
这种混血看起来特别…
A hybrid that seems particularly...

120
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,630
鲁莽
reckless.

121
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,640
你知道吗 我听说你们都是自以为是的混蛋
You know, they told me you people were conceited douchebags...

122
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,580
但那完全不是事实
but that isn't true at all.

123
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,190
糟糕
Oh, shit.

124
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,680
我又用错眼睛了 是吗
I'm using my wrong eye again, aren't I?

125
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,070
我很抱歉 我没想被你发现的
I'm sorry. That was meant to be behind your back.

126
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,270
他们没杀你算你走运
Count yourself blessed they didn't kill you.

127
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,620
还用你说
You're telling me.

128
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,750
你想买点电池吗
You wanna buy some batteries?

129
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,250
好吧 我们把小秃子送去山达尔领赏吧
All right, let's get baldy to Xandar and collect that bounty.

130
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,450
[劲歌金曲 第二辑]

131
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,380
她说我父亲的那些话
That stuff about my father...

132
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,470
她以为她是谁啊
Who does she think she is?

133
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,990
我知道你对那件事有点敏感
I know you're sensitive about that.

134
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,800
我才没有敏感 我只是不知道他是什么人
I'm not sensitive about it. I just don't know who he is.

135
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,220
如果我看起来像是在跟大祭司调情那很抱歉
Sorry if it seemed like I was flirting with the High Priestess.

136
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,700
我没那个意思
I wasn't.

137
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,140
即使你有我也不在意
I don't care if you were.

138
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,560
我觉得你在意
Well, I feel like you do care.

139
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,700
所以我在道歉 对不起
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!

140
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,220
卡魔拉不适合你 奎尔
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.

141
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,800
鬼鬼祟祟的
Damn shadow.

142
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,120
宇宙中有两种人
There are two types of beings in the universe...

143
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,100
一种是跳舞的人 另一种是不跳舞的人
those who dance, and those who do not.

144
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,540
我第一次见到我的爱人是在一场战争集会上
I first met my beloved at a war rally.

145
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,450
天哪
Oh, God.

146
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,820
村子里每个人都在跳舞
Everyone in the village flailed about, dancing.

147
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,200
除了一个女人
Except one woman.

148
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,970
我的奥薇特
My Ovette.

149
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,140
我立刻就知道她是我的真命天女
I knew immediately she was the one for me.

150
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,990
即使听着最有旋律的音乐
The most melodic song in the world could be playing.

151
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,520
她连脚都不会点一下
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

152
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,830
动都不会动一下
Wouldn't move a muscle.

153
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,140
看上去就像是死了
One might assume she was dead.

154
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,330
听起来很性感
That does sound pretty hot.

155
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,890
我下面都要充血了
It would make my nether regions engorge.

156
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,920
好吧 我懂了 没错
Okay. I get it, yes.

157
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,510
我是个舞者 而卡魔拉不是
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

158
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,460
你只需要找到一个跟你一样不着调的女人
You just need to find a woman who is pathetic... like you.

159
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,370
我饿了 那些亚罗根给我来点
I'm hungry. Hand me some of that yaro root.

160
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,230
不行 还没熟
No. It's not ripe yet...

161
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,110
而且我恨你
and I hate you.

162
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,220
你恨我
You hate me?

163
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,260
你丢下了我 自己去偷那块石头了
You left me there while you stole that stone for yourself.

164
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,850
而现在你却像个英雄一样
And yet here you stand, a hero.

165
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,730
很快我就能摆脱这枷锁
I will be free of these shackles soon enough,

166
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,090
然后我会杀了你
and I will kill you.

167
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,330
我发誓
I swear.

168
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,280
不
No.

169
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,440
你会在山达尔的监狱里
You're gonna live out the rest of your days

170
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,780
度过余生
in a prison on Xandar...

171
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,290
做那个白日梦
wishing you could.

172
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,440
奇怪
This is weird.

173
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,550
有一队索维林飞船从后面追上来了
We've got a Sovereign fleet approaching from the rear.

174
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,650
他们为什么要这样
Why would they do that?

175
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,560
可能是因为火箭偷了他们几个电池
Probably because Rocket stole some of their batteries.

176
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,570
老兄
Dude!

177
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,870
哦
Right.

178
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,480
他没偷电池
He didn't steal some of those.

179
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,670
我不知道他们为什么追我们 真奇怪啊
I don't know why they're after us. What a mystery this is.

180
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,850
你怎么想的
What were you thinking?

181
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,790
哥们 那些电池真的很容易偷
Dude, they were really easy to steal!

182
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,270
- 这就是你的辩解  - 拜托
- That's your defense?  - Come on!

183
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,820
你看到那个大祭司高高在上的样子了
You saw how that High Priestess talked down to us.

184
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,490
我这是在教训她
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

185
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,020
我没想到你的动机这么无私
I didn't realize your motivation was altruism.

186
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,090
真是遗憾啊
It's really a shame

187
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,500
那些索维林人没领会到你的好意
the Sovereign have mistaken your intentions...

188
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,410
- 还想杀掉我们  - 说的太对了
- and they're trying to kill us.  - Exactly!

189
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,260
我是在讽刺你
I was being sarcastic!

190
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:53,910
不
Oh, no!

191
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,250
你应该用讽刺的语气 这下我出丑了
You're supposed to use a sarcastic voice! Now I look foolish!

192
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,360
斗嘴先省省好不好
Can we put the bickering on hold

193
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,940
活过这场太空大战再说
until after we survive this massive space battle?

194
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,470
- 更多敌人朝我们来了  - 很好
- More incoming!  - Good!

195
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,250
我想杀杀人
I wanna kill some guys!

196
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,430
你谁也没杀掉
You're not killing anyone.

197
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,400
这些飞船都是遥控驾驶的
All those ships are remotely piloted.

198
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,620
该死
Damn it!

199
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,180
在磨蹭什么 舰队司令
What is the delay, Admiral?

200
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,120
大祭司 那些电池
High Priestess, the batteries,

201
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,120
它们极其易燃
they are exceptionally combustible...

202
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,580
可能会摧毁整个舰队
and could destroy the entire fleet.

203
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,580
我们在意的是他们对我们的不敬
Our concern is their slight against our people.

204
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,370
我们雇佣了他们 他们却偷我们的
We hired them and they steal from us.

205
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,680
这是最大的亵渎
It is heresy of the highest order.

206
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,670
所有操作单位
All command modules...

207
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,820
对目标格杀勿论
fire with the intent to kill.

208
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,150
最近的宜居星球是哪里
What's the nearest habitable planet?

209
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,330
是一个叫博赫特的星球
It's called Berhert.

210
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,340
- 需要几次星际跳跃  - 只要一次
- How many jumps?  - Only one.

211
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,840
但进入点在四十七公里外
But the access point is 47 clicks away.

212
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,190
而且你得穿过那片量子小行星群
And you have to go through that quantum asteroid field.

213
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,710
奎尔 要想穿过那里
Quill, to make it through that

214
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,870
你得是全宇宙最棒的飞行员
you'd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.

215
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,230
那我们走运了
Lucky for us,

216
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,850
- 我就…  - 我就是
- I...  - I am.

217
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,370
你在干什么
What are you doing?

218
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,570
我从十岁就开始开这玩意了
I've been flying this rig since I was 10 years old.

219
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,520
我就是为开宇宙飞船而设计制造的
I was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft.

220
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,260
你就是设计制造成了个混蛋
You were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag!

221
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,680
- 别闹了  - 奎尔
- Stop it.  - Quill.

222
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,800
今天晚上 你躺在床上的时候
Later on tonight, you're gonna be laying down in your bed

223
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,860
你的枕套里会有黏糊糊的一坨
and there's gonna be something squishy in your pillow case.

224
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,290
你会想“这是什么”
And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"

225
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,090
那会是我放的一坨屎
And it's gonna be because I put a turd in there!

226
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,370
你敢把你的屎放我床上 我就剃光你
You put your turd in my bed, I shave you.

227
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,110
才不会放我的
It won't be my turd.

228
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,590
我会放德拉克斯的
It will be Drax's.

229
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,140
我的屎蛋出了名的大
I have famously huge turds.

230
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,620
我们都快要死了 现在就讨论这个吗
We're about to die, and this is what we're discussing?

231
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,120
混蛋
Son of a...

232
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,950
哥们 搞什么
Dude! Seriously!

233
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,360
我来…
Let me...

234
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,290
蠢货
Idiots!

235
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,720
奎尔开飞船就这下场
Well, that's what you get when Quill flies.

236
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,790
还有一架索维林飞船在追我们
We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.

237
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,020
我们武器坏了
Our weapons are down.

238
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,620
还有二十公里跳跃
Twenty clicks to the jump!

239
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,950
坐稳了
Hold on.

240
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,240
还没熟呢
It's not ripe.

241
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,850
[应急宇航服 也可以穿着玩]

242
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,240
加油 扎莱克 你可以的
Come on, Zylak. You can do this.

243
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,830
太棒了
Yes!

244
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,180
还有十五公里跳跃
Fifteen clicks to the jump!

245
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,060
加油
Come on!

246
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,990
继续
Keep going!

247
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,120
还有十公里
Ten clicks!

248
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,540
去死吧 破船
Die, spaceship!

249
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,590
你弱爆了 扎莱克
You suck, Zylak.

250
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,620
不出所料
Typical.

251
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,740
还有五公里
Five clicks!

252
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,710
混蛋
Son of a...

253
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,960
他们绕过了星群
They went around the field!

254
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,090
有人摧毁了我们所有的飞船
Someone destroyed all our ships!

255
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,740
什么
What?

256
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,840
是谁
Who?

257
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,100
还有一公里
One click!

258
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,780
- 那是什么  - 管他呢
- What is that?  - Who cares?

259
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,190
跳跃点就在那儿 快 快
That's the jump point! Go! Go!

260
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,200
那是个人
It's a guy.

261
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,340
天啊
Oh, my God.

262
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,670
他还在外面吗
He's still out there?

263
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,470
格鲁特 系好安全带
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

264
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,200
准备好要强行降落了
Prepare for a really bad landing!

265
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:03,430
[博赫特星]

266
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,280
刚才太赞了
That was awesome!

267
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,190
棒
Yes!

268
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,280
你看看
Look at this!

269
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,000
咱们飞船的另一半呢
Where is the other half of our ship?

270
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,830
是我的船
My ship.

271
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,840
你们任何一个都可以带我们平安穿过星群
Either one of you could have gotten us through that field...

272
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,730
如果你们肯用上面这个
had you flown with what's between your ears

273
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,370
而不是下面那个驾驶飞船
instead of what's between your legs!

274
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,340
如果我下面那个长了手
If what's between my legs had a hand on it...

275
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,340
那我绝对可以用它来降落飞船
I guarantee I could have landed this ship with it.

276
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,160
彼得
Peter,

277
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,330
我们差点被你的傲慢害死
we almost died because of your arrogance.

278
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,730
是因为他偷能量电池还差不多
More like because he stole the Anulax batteries!

279
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,100
那个叫棱酿电池
They're called Harbulary batteries.

280
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,500
不 不叫那个
No, they're not!

281
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,970
你知道我为什么那么做吗 星嚼
Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch?

282
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,670
我才不叫“星嚼”
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."

283
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,750
因为我乐意
I did it because I wanted to!

284
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,350
混蛋
Dick.

285
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,650
我们为什么要讨论这个
What are we even talking about this for?

286
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,650
刚才有个小人炸了五十艘飞船救了我们
We just had a little man save us by blowing up 50 ships!

287
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,660
有多小
How little?

288
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,670
我也不知道 大概这么小
Well, I don't know, like this?

289
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,680
一个一英寸的小人救了我们吗
A little one-inch man saved us?

290
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,000
他要是近一点 肯定就会大一点吧
Well, if he got closer, I'm sure he would be much larger.

291
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,360
那叫近大远小 你个傻浣熊
That's how eyesight works, you stupid raccoon.

292
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,100
别叫我浣熊
Don't call me a raccoon!

293
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,660
抱歉 是我过分了
I'm sorry. I took it too far.

294
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,120
我是想说垃圾熊猫
I meant trash panda.

295
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,310
那样好听点吗
Is that better?

296
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,840
我不知道
I don't know.

297
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,200
这个更损 这个损多了
It's worse. It's so much worse.

298
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,650
你个混蛋
You son of a...

299
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,950
- 我受够你了  - 别过来
- I've had it with you!  - No! Back up!

300
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,980
有人从跳跃点跟着你们来了
Someone followed you through the jump point.

301
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,160
放了我 你们需要我帮忙
Set me free, you'll need my help.

302
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,000
我又不傻 星云
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

303
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,090
如果在战斗中拒绝帮助就是犯傻
You are a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat.

304
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,860
我一放了你 你就会攻击我的
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.

305
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,660
我不会的
No, I won't.

306
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,200
你这种超级大坏蛋不是应该很会说谎吗
You'd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.

307
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,210
我赌是那个一英寸的小人
I bet it's the one-inch man.

308
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,670
时隔这么多年 我终于找到你了
After all these years, I've found you.

309
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,280
你到底是谁
And who the hell are you?

310
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,260
我以为我沧桑帅气的外表就足以说明了
I figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious.

311
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,550
我叫伊戈
My name is Ego...

312
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,140
我是你爸爸 彼得
and I'm your dad, Peter.

[康特阿克夏星]

314
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,600
你知道俗话怎么说的
You know what they say...

315
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,330
“跟过鸭鸭 好运就来”
"You're out of luck until you've gone duck."

316
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,320
勇度
Yondu!

317
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,350
快下来
Come on down!

318
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:36,140
兜兜转转这么多年
After going around years in circles...

319
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,680
跟我最终娶的这女人周旋
with this woman I end up marrying.

320
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,440
我说 “艾丽塔 我爱你
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...

321
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,030
但你真是疯了”
"But you're losing your mind!"

322
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,030
话说回来 她一直都那样
Then again, she's always been that way.

323
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,710
我从来都不能相信她
I could never trust her. You know?

324
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,390
斯塔卡
Stakar.

325
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,790
好久不见
It's been some time.

326
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,170
看来这个场子
It seems like this establishment

327
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,520
堕落错了方式
is the wrong kind of disreputable.

328
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,510
- 先生  - 斯塔卡
- Sir!  - Stakar!

329

掠夺者有一百个派系
There's a hundred Ravager factions.

330
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,190
你为了接待其中一个 而失去了剩下九十九个的
You lost the business of 99 of them by serving one.

331
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,840
求你了 先生 别走
Please, sir. Please!

332
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,650
- 别碰我  - 求你
- Get away from me.  - Please!

333
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,800
你下地狱吧
You can go to hell then!

334
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,940
我不在乎你怎么看我
I don't give a damn what you think of me!

335
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,690
那你跟着我们干什么
So what are you following us for?

336
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,320
因为你必须听我说
Because you're gonna listen to what I gotta say!

337
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,550
我什么都不用听 是你背叛了准则
I don't gotta listen to nothing! You betrayed the code!

338
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,590
掠夺者不买卖孩子
Ravagers don't deal in kids.

339
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,370
我告诉过你 我不知道是怎么回事
I told you before! I didn't know what was going on!

340

你不知道
You didn't know

341
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,120
是因为你不想知道
because you didn't want to know

342
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,200
因为你靠这个发财
because it made you rich.

343
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,900
我要求有一席之地 我跟你们一样佩戴焰标
I demand a seat at the table! I wear these flames, same as you.

344
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,330
你虽然穿得像我们
You may dress like us...

但你死后别想听到自由号角声 勇度
but you'll never hear the Horns of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,810
你伤了我们所有人的心
You broke all our hearts.

352
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,150
可悲
Pathetic.

353
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,890
起先 奎尔背叛了我们
First, Quill betrays us...

354
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,130
结果勇度把他毫发无伤地放走了
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.

355
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,140
我们跟随他 是因为他
We followed him because he was the one

356
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,890
敢做不得不做的事
who wasn't afraid to do what needed to be done.

357
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,330
看来他变软弱了
Seems he's goin' soft.

358
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,990
要是他软弱 你这么小声干吗
If he's so soft, why are you whispering for?

359
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,360
你知道我说得对 克拉林
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

360
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,620
小心点 怎么说我们船长呢
You best be very careful what you say about our captain.

361
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,350
这是谁
Who the hell is that?

362
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,360
勇度·尤冬塔
Yondu Udonta...

363
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,870
我有个提议
I have a proposition for you.

364
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,930
你母亲去世后
I hired Yondu to pick you up

365
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,780
我雇了勇度去接你
when your mother passed away.

366
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,930
但他没有把你还给我
But instead of returning you...

367
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,420
而是把你留下了
Yondu kept you.

368
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,150
我不知道为什么
I have no clue as to why.

369
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,930
我告诉你为什么
Well, I'll tell you why.

370
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,620
因为我是个瘦得皮包骨的小孩
Because I was a skinny little kid

371
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,320
能溜进成年人进不去的地方
who could squeeze into places adults couldn't.

372
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,010
偷东西更容易
It made it easier for thievin'.

373
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,440
从那时起 我就一直在寻找你的下落
Well, I've been trying to track you down ever since.

374
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,370
我还以为勇度是你父亲
I thought Yondu was your father.

375
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,740
什么 我们在一起这么久
What? We've been together this whole time

376
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,370
你以为勇度是我的血亲
and you thought Yondu was my actual blood relative?

377
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,180
你俩长得一模一样
You look exactly alike.

378
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,800
勇度是蓝的
One's blue!

379
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,280
不 他不是我父亲
No, he's not my father!

380
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,370
勇度绑架了我
Yondu was the guy who abducted me

381
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,520
把我打得满地找牙 让我学会怎么打架
kicked the crap out of me so I could learn to fight

382
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,150
威胁要吃了我 让我一直担惊受怕
and kept me in terror by threatening to eat me.

383
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,720
- 吃了你  - 是啊
- Eat you?  - Yeah.

384
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,580
那个王八蛋
That son of a bitch.

385
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,340
你怎么找到我们的
How'd you locate us now?

386
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,960
哪怕像我住得那么偏僻
Even where I reside, out past the edge of what's known

387
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,770
也听说过传说中的星爵
we've heard tell about the man they call Star-Lord.

388
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,660
我们现在就出发去那儿怎么样
What say we head out there right now?

389
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,200
欢迎你的伙伴一起去
Your associates are welcome.

390
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,220
包括那只三角脸猴子
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.

391
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,780
我保证
I promise you...

392
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,640
那是一个与众不同的地方
it's unlike any other place you've ever seen.

393
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,120
在那里
And there...

394
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:51,040
我能给你解释你特别的身世
I can explain your very special heritage.

395
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,590
终于能做
Finally get to be the...

396
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,580
我一直想做的那个父亲了
father I've always wanted to be.

397
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,020
失陪了
Excuse me.

398
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,370
我去撒泡尿
I've gotta take a whiz.

399
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,880
我不信
I'm not buying it.

400
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,830
我们去散步吧
Let's go take a walk.

401
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,510
我叫螳螂
I am Mantis.

402
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,520
你在干什么
What are you doing?

403
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,040
微笑
Smiling.

404
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,130
我听说 这样做能让人们喜欢你
I hear it is the thing to do to make people like you.

405
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,270
你那么笑可不能
Not if you do it like that.

406
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:39,320
我一个人在伊戈的星球上长大
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

407
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,300
我不了解人际交流的微妙
I do not understand the intricacies of social interaction.

408
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,940
我能摸摸你的狗狗吗 它好可爱
Can I pet your puppy? It is adorable.

409
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,460
可以
Yes.

410
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,610
这叫恶作剧
That is called a practical joke!

411
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,090
我很喜欢
I liked it very much!

412
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,240
是我刚想的
I just made it up!

413
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,460
饶了我吧
Give me a break!

414
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,020
都过了这么久了 突然出现
After all this time, you're gonna show up,

415
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,830
- 还突然要当我爸  - 是啊
- and just all of a sudden you wanna be my dad?  - I hear you.

416
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,190
另外 这可能是个陷阱 好吗
And by the way, this could be a trap. Okay?

417
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,910
克里纯种主义者 掠夺者
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...

418
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,990
- 都想杀死我们  - 我知道 但是…
- they all want us dead.  - I know, but...

419
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:29,910
但是什么
But what?

420
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,710
你给我讲的扎渡·霍索妇的故事呢
What was that story you told me about Zardu Hasselfrau?

421
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,570
谁
Who?

422
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,260
有一艘魔法船的那个
He owned a magic boat?

423
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,310
大卫·霍索夫
David Hasselhoff?

424
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:38,940
就是他
Right.

425
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,440
不是魔法船 是会说话的车
Not a magic boat. A talking car.

426
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,720
为什么会说话来着
Why did he talk again?

427
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,200
为了帮他打击犯罪 并给予精神支持
To help him fight crime, and to be supportive.

428
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,940
你小时候会随身带着他的照片
As a child, you would carry his picture in your pocket

429
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,970
告诉其他小孩
and you would tell all the other children

430
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,410
说他是你父亲 但他出门了
that he was your father, but that he was out of town.

431
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,010
拍摄《霹雳游侠》或者跟乐队在德国巡回演出
Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany.

432
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,380
那是我喝醉时告诉你的
I told you that when I was drunk.

433
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,600
你现在提它干吗
Why are you bringing that up now?

434
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,820
我喜欢那个故事
I love that story.

435
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,640
我讨厌那个故事
I hate that story.

436
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,350
太可悲了
It's so sad!

437
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,440
我小时候总是看着其他孩子
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids off

438
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,600
跟他们的爸爸玩投接球
playing catch with their dad. And I

439
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,690
我也想让爸爸陪我玩 那是我最大的心愿
I wanted that, more than anything in the world!

440
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,530
我就想说这个 彼得
That's my point, Peter.

441
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,770
如果这个人就是你的霍索夫呢
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?

442
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,870
听着 如果我们发现他是坏人
Listen, if he ends up being evil...

443
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,130
那就杀了他
we will just kill him.

444
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,240
你要把我丢给那只狐狸
You're leaving me with that fox?

445
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,560
他不是狐狸
He's not a fox.

446
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,780
要是她行为可疑 就开枪打她
Shoot her if she does anything suspicious.

447
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,710
- 或者你想打就打  - 好
- Or if you feel like it.  - Okay.

448
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,120
就几天而已
It'll be just a couple of days.

449
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,740
还没等火箭修好飞船 我们就能回来了
We'll be back before Rocket's finished fixing the ship.

450
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,290
要是索维林人来了怎么办
What if the Sovereign come?

451
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,610
他们不可能知道我们在这儿 走吧
There's no way for them to know we're here. Let's go.

452
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,850
我觉得兵分两路不太好
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

453
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,240
天啊 你就像个老太婆
God, you're like an old woman.

454
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,980
因为我睿智吗
Because I'm wise?

455
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,060
你怎么有这么多行李
Why do you have so much luggage?

456
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,030
我不想让格鲁特乱动我的东西
I don't want Groot playing with my things.

457
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,950
希望老爸不像你那么混蛋 小孤儿
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.

458
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,520
你的目的是什么 让所有人都讨厌你吗
What is your goal here? To get everybody to hate you?

459
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,320
你成功了
Because it's working.

460
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,150
我能问你个私人问题吗
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

461
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,070
还没人问过我私人问题呢
No one has ever asked me a personal question.

462
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,710
你的触角是干什么的
Your antennae, what are they for?

463
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,460
触角的用途
Their purpose?

464
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,420
对 奎尔和我打了个赌
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.

465
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,310
哥们 你不应该说出来的
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!

466
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,530
我说
I say...

467
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,160
当你要穿过一个很低的门框时
that if you are about to go through a doorway that is too low...

468
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,730
你的触角能感知高度
your antennae will feel this,

469
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,350
防止你撞掉脑袋
and keep you from being decapitated.

470
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,060
对 如果是任何
Right. And if it's anything other than

471
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,090
防止掉脑袋之外的用途 那我赢
you specifically not being decapitated by a doorway, I win.

472
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:39,420
它们不是感知门框用的
They are not for feeling doorways.

473
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,560
我觉得
I think...

474
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:45,020
它们跟我的共情能力有关
they have something to do with my empathic abilities.

475
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,190
那是什么
What are those?

476
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,410
我触碰别人时 我能感觉到他们的感受
If I touch someone, I can feel their feelings.

477
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,470
- 你会读心术  - 不是
- You read minds?  - No.

478
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,740
心灵感应是感知想法
Telepaths know thoughts.

479
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,390
共情是感知感情
Empaths feel feelings.

480
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,220
情绪
Emotions.

481
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,210
可以吗
May I?

482
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,700
好
All right.

483
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,030
你怀着爱
You feel love.

484
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,320
是的 我怀着一种
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,

485
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,730
- 对所有人的无私的大爱  - 不
- unselfish love for just about everybody.  - No!

486
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,200
是浪漫的 肉欲的爱
Romantic, sexual love.

487
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,390
我才没
No, I don't.

488
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,070
- 爱的是她  - 不
- For her!  - No!

489
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,280
不是
That is not...

490
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:31,990
好吧
Okay.

491
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:38,140
她把你最不可告人的秘密说出来了
She just told everyone your deepest, darkest secret!

492
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,160
哥们 拜托 你有点反应过度了
Dude, come on, I think you're overreacting a little bit!

493
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,540
你肯定尴尬死了
You must be so embarrassed!

494
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,250
来感知一下我 试试我
Do me! Do me! Do me!

495
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,540
我从来没感觉过如此的幽默
I have never felt such humor!

496
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,410
真是讨厌到难以置信
So unbelievably uncool.

497
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,250
奎尔
Quill.

498
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:10,510
敢摸我 你就只能感觉到下巴骨折
Touch me, and the only thing you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.

499
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:20,150
我也可以稍微改变人的情绪
I can also alter emotions to some extent.

500
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,340
比如
Yeah, like what?

501
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,830
如果我碰到悲伤的人
If I touch someone who is sad...

502
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,560
我可以安抚他们 让他们获得暂时的满足感
I can ease them into contentment for a short while.

503
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,250
我可以让固执的人变顺从
I can make a stubborn person compliant.

504
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,630
但我主要用我的能力帮助主人入睡
But I mostly use it to help my master sleep.

505
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,370
他夜里想着后代 无法入睡
He lies awake at night thinking about his progeny.

506
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,420
在我身上试试那个
Do one of those on me.

507
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,990
睡吧
Sleep.

508
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,650
我喜欢这首歌
I love this song.

509
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,640
在那儿
There!

510
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,740
没了那些玩具 你就没那么厉害了吧
Ain't so tough now without all your toys...

511
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,640
是不是
are you?

512
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
闪开
Move!

513
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,810
糟了
Crap.

514
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,980
好啊 耗子
Hey there, rat!

515
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,150
你好吗 你个蓝蠢货
How's it going, you blue idiot?

516
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,540
还不错
Not so bad.

517
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,820
我们接了一份美差
We got ourselves a pretty good little gig here.

518
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:20,450
有个自命不凡的金闪闪的姑娘
This golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself has

519
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,190
给我们开出很高的价码
offered us a large sum

520
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,870
要我们抓到你和你的同伴交给她
to deliver you and your pals over to her

521
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,690
因为她想杀了你们
because she wants to kill y'all.

522
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,570
你的朋友
Your friend...

523
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,580
敌人太多了
There's too many of them.

524
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,330
他需要我帮忙 要是你在乎他
He needs my help. If you care about him...

525
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,280
你得帮我解开手铐
you need to get me out of these bonds.

526
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,260
他们会杀了他的
They are going to kill him!

527
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,820
告诉你 找到你可容易了
I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.

528
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,720
山达尔大战的时候 我在你们飞船上
I put a tracer on your ship back there

529
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,430
放了个追踪器
during the war over Xandar.

530
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,830
你保证不伤害格鲁特
Give me your word you won't hurt Groot...

531
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,310
我就告诉你电池在哪
and I'll tell you where the batteries are.

532
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,600
你真走运 我说话不算数
Lucky for you, my word don't mean squat.

533
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,570
不然我就把你们交出去了
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

534
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,490
不然你就什么
Otherwise, you'd what?

535
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,630
我们把电池拿走
We'll take them batteries.

536
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:03,050
它们值多少 在市场上能卖个二十五万
They're worth what? A quarter mill on the open market?

537
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,630
那个祭司答应给我们一百万
That Priestess offered us a million.

538
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:08,630
二十五万才三分之一
A quarter is only one third of that!

539
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,880
二十五万不是三分之一
A quarter ain't a third.

540
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,090
二十五万就是二十五
A quarter is 25.

541
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:12,740
不是
No.

542
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,460
二十五连双靴子都卖不来
We can't even buy a pair of boots with 25 units.

543
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,430
够了
Enough!

544
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,390
重点是 我们没那么蠢
The point is, we ain't stupid enough

545
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,840
会帮忙把银河护卫队杀掉
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

546
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,380
整个新星军团都不会放过我们的
The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.

547
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,990
这样不对
That ain't right!

548
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,640
我就说这一次 船长
I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.

549
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,990
不管奎尔背叛你几次
No matter how many times Quill betrays you

550
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,830
你都会保护他 就好像我们其他人都不重要
you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!

551
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:36,900
是啊
Yeah!

552
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,850
我才是会支持你的人
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

553
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:39,690
别激动 克拉林
Take it easy, Kraglin.

554
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:42,600
说对了 伙计 他是心变软了
Damn straight, lad. He's gone soft.

555
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,800
或许改换个领导人了
Suppose it's time for a change in leadership.

556
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,860
放下你们的枪
Put your damn guns down!

557
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,910
这事肯定是可以和平解决的 各位
There must be some kind of peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

558
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,720
哪怕是武力解决也好 只要我站那边
Or even a violent one where I'm standing over there.

559
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,780
你们好啊 小伙子们
Well, hello, boys.

560
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,740
没熟
It's not ripe.

561
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:56,350
[伊戈的星球]

562
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:17,060
各位 欢迎来到我的世界
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

563
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,110
你有自己的星球
You have your own planet?

564
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:23,380
没什么的 也不比地球的月亮大
Come on. No larger than your Earth's Moon.

565
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,010
谦逊
Humility.

566
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,550
我喜欢
I like it.

567
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,850
我也是个非常谦虚的人
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

568
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:13,330
你有自己的星球
You own a planet

569
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,130
还能不穿太空服就干掉几十艘飞船
and can destroy two dozen spaceships without a suit.

570
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,360
你究竟是什么人
What are you exactly?

571
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,090
我是所谓的天神 亲爱的
I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.

572
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,140
天神 你是个神吗
A Celestial, like a god?

573
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,500
就是个普通神 儿子
Small "G," Son.

574
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,800
至少在我跟德拉克斯一样谦逊的日子里是的
At least on the days I'm feeling humble as Drax.

575
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:51,530
我也不知道我究竟从哪来
I don't know where I came from exactly.

576
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,180
我最初的记忆是闪烁
First thing I remember is flickering

577
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,430
漂浮在宇宙中
adrift in the cosmos utterly

578
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,470
完全孤独地存在着
and entirely alone.

579
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:02,710
经历了数百万年
Over millions of years

580
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:06,480
我学会了控制我周围的分子
I learned to control the molecules around me.

581
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:10,040
我越来越聪明 越来越强大
I grew smarter and stronger.

582
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,950
我不断地建造着
And I continued building from there...

583
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,830
一层又一层
layer by layer...

584
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:19,850
最终建成了你们现在脚下的星球
the very planet you walk on now.

585
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:23,370
但我不满足
But I wanted more.

586
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,480
我渴望
I desired...

587
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,320
意义
meaning.

588
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,360
我想着 这宇宙中肯定还有
"There must be some life out there in the universe...

589
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,690
我之外的生命
"Besides just me," I thought.

590
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,470
于是 我立志要找到生命
And so, I set myself the task of finding it.

591
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,580
我创造了
I created...

592
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,360
我所想象的生物生命
what I imagined biological life to be like...

593
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:49,620
包括最细微的细节
down to the most minute detail.

594
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,970
你做老二了吗
Did you make a penis?

595
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:52,840
哥们
Dude!

596
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,300
你什么毛病啊
What is wrong with you?

597
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,990
如果他是个星球 怎么能跟你母亲造人啊
If he is a planet, how could he make a baby with your mother?

598
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,550
他会压扁她的
He would smush her!

599
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:03,480
我不想听我父母是怎么…
I don't need to hear how my parents...

600
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,550
为什么
Why?

601
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:07,990
我父亲每年冬至
My father would tell the story of

602
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:09,980
都会讲述他让我母亲怀孕的故事
impregnating my mother every winter solstice.

603
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,130
太恶心了
That's disgusting.

604
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,970
那很美
It was beautiful.

605
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,940
你们地球人真有病
You Earthers have hang-ups.

606
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,930
是啊 德拉克斯 我有老二
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.

607
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:20,500
谢谢
Thank you!

608
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,960
而且不赖
It's not half bad.

609
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:27,080
我还有痛觉 消化系统
I've also got pain receptors, and a digestive system and

610
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:29,570
和所有附带的一切
all the accompanying junk.

611
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:34,140
我想真正地体验为人
I wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human

612
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,940
于是我探索群星
as I set out amongst the stars...

613
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,830
直到我找到了
until I found...

614
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,460
我所寻找的
what I sought.

615
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,390
生命
Life.

616
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,580
我在这宇宙中终究不是孤独的
I was not alone in the universe after all.

617
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,130
你什么时候认识我母亲的
When did you meet my mother?

618
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,930
不久之后
Not long after.

619
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:13,880
是梅瑞狄斯让我第一次体验了爱
It was with Meredith that I first experienced love.

620
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,240
我
I

621
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,820
喊她我的水百合
called her my river lily.

622
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,330
那份爱 彼得
And from that love, Peter...

623
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,140
创造了你
you.

624
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,580
我找了你好久
I have searched for you for so long.

625
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,600
当我听说一个地球人
And when I heard of a man from Earth

626
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,850
手握无限宝石还能不死
who held an Infinity Stone in his hand without dying...

627
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:55,140
我就知道你一定是我所爱的女人的儿子
I knew you must be the son of the woman I loved.

628
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,720
如果你爱她 为什么要离开她
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

629
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,510
这是哗变
This is mutiny!

630
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,190
这是哗变
This is mutiny!

631
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,220
这是哗变
This is mutiny!

632
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,110
你们这些渣滓
You're scum!

633
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:17,850
船长
Captain!

634
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:20,610
救我啊
Help me! Please!

635
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:21,670
船长
Captain!

636
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,490
是你害死了那些人
You're the one what killed those men

637
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,830
你领他们走错了路
by leading them down the wrong path.

638
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,870
因为你软弱
Because you're weak.

639
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,920
还愚蠢
And stupid!

640
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:40,490
现在 掠夺者
It's time for the Ravagers

641
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:44,520
要再次恢复荣誉 追随新船长
to rise once again to glory with a new captain...

642
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:47,900
电击脸
Taserface!

643
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:57,890
抱歉 抱歉 你名叫
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Your name is...

644
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,770
电击脸
It's Taserface?

645
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,210
没错
That's right.

646
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,410
你的脸有电击能力吗
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?

647
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,040
是个比喻
It's metaphorical!

648
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,440
是啊
Yeah!

649
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:12,340
比喻什么
For what?

650
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,930
比喻
For

651
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,330
这个名字能让任何
it is a name what strikes fear

652
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:20,330
听到它的人 心生恐惧
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.

653
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:23,910
嗯
Okay.

654
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:25,940
好吧
Okay...

655
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,320
随你说吧
whatever you say.

656
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:28,960
你闭嘴
You shut up.

657
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,120
你就是下一个
You're next.

658
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:35,350
尤冬塔 我等了好久…
Udonta, I have waited a long time to do...

659
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:36,160
怎么了
What?

660
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:40,480
对不起 真对不起
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

661
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,350
我就是一直在想象 先生 你早上醒来
I just keep imagining you waking up in the morning, sir,

662
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:44,210
看着镜子
looking in the mirror

663
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,530
严肃地对自己说
and then in all seriousness saying to yourself,

664
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:51,550
“知道什么名字特别拽吗 电击脸”
"You know what would be a really kick-ass name? Taserface!"

665
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,980
我想象你就是这样
That's how I hear you in my head!

666
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,340
你的第二选择是什么
What was your second choice?

667
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,020
阴囊帽吗
Scrotum Hat?

668
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,360
新计划 我们先杀你
New plan. We're killing you first.

669
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:06,260
好吧
Well,

670
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:09,980
死也比做一辈子的
dying is certainly better than having to live an entire life

671
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:13,950
混蛋白痴 觉得电击脸很酷强
as a moronic shitbag who thinks Taserface is a cool name.

672
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:16,660
今天就杀到这儿吧
That's enough killing for today.

673
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,240
她是灭霸的女儿
She's the daughter of Thanos.

674
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:27,160
我以为你是银河系头号的施虐狂
I thought you were the biggest sadist in the galaxy.

675
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,370
那是爸爸雇我的时候
That was when Daddy was paying my bills.

676
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:32,640
大祭司想亲手杀了那狐狸
The Priestess wants to kill the fox herself.

677
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,100
而至少有十二个克里省在通缉他
And he has bounties on his head in at least 12 Kree provinces.

678
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,700
我保证
I assure you...

679
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,850
我可不像离了魔法棍子的老头子
I am not as easy a mark as an old man without his magic stick...

680
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,810
或会说话的森林野兽那么好对付
or a talking woodland beast.

681
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,990
我要百分之十的赏金
I want 10% of the take...

682
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,660
还有几样东西
and a couple more things.

683
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,920
我们有一整盒的手
We got a whole box of hands...

684
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,320
- 如果那个不行的话  - 挺好的
- if that one don't work out.  - It is fine.

685
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,460
你觉得克里人会处死船长吗
You think them Kree is gonna execute the captain?

686
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:04,170
克里人自视仁慈 不会让他痛苦的
The Kree consider themselves merciful. It will be painless.

687
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:08,460
就在这儿 这是我们最好的一艘船
Well, here it is. It's the best ship we got.

688
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,460
伊戈星球的位置发到导航里了
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.

689
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,700
等我们拿到钱就把那百分之十汇给你
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.

690
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,780
你打算拿你的那份做什么
What are you gonna do with your share?

691
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,210
我还是孩子时 我父亲会让
As a child, my father would have

692
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:19,770
我和卡魔拉在训练中对打
Gamora and me battle one another in training.

693
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,050
每次我姐姐赢了
Every time my sister prevailed

694
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:26,160
我父亲就会把我身体的一部分换成机械
my father would replace a piece of me with machinery

695
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:29,470
他说是希望我能像她一样强
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

696
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,930
但她总赢
But she won...

697
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:37,790
一次又一次 从没一次手下留情
again and again, and again, never once refraining.

698
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:40,880
所以等我杀了我姐姐
So after I murder my sister...

699
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,080
我要买一艘战舰 装上所有杀戮武器
I will buy a warship with every conceivable instrument of death.

700
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,510
我要像抓狗一样找到我父亲
I will hunt my father like a dog,

701
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:48,680
然后慢慢把他撕碎
and I will tear him apart slowly

702
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:50,390
一块一块地拆开
piece by piece...

703
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:54,010
直到他能稍有体会我每一天所经历的
until he knows some semblance of the profound and unceasing pain

704
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:57,100
无休止的深刻痛苦
I know every single day.

705
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,050
哦
Yeah.

706
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,900
我想的是买条漂亮项链什么的
I was talking about, like, a pretty necklace.

707
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,220
或是好看的帽子
Or a nice hat. You know,

708
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:08,650
让其他姑娘都说“哎呀 真漂亮”
something to make the other girls go, "Ooh, that's nice!"

709
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,060
总之 一路顺风
Anyways, happy trails.

710
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:26,240
我母亲跟所有人说我父亲来自星星
My mother told everyone my father was from the stars.

711
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,970
她有脑瘤 所以大家都以为她是在妄想
She had brain cancer, so everyone thought she was delusional.

712
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:31,810
彼得
Peter...

713
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:34,400
听着 我真的很想相信这一切
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this, I really would.

714
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,380
但你离开了这世上最棒的女人
But you left the most wonderful woman ever

715
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:40,190
让她孤独离世
to die alone.

716
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:43,720
我并不想离开你母亲的 彼得
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.

717
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:46,350
如果我不定期回到我的星球
If I don't return regularly to my planet

718
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:47,760
回归其内部的光
and the light within it

719
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:49,370
这个人形将退化消逝
this form will wither and perish.

720
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:51,720
那你为什么不回来 你为什么叫勇度去
So why didn't you come back? Why did you send Yondu?

721
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,980
偏偏叫一个罪犯去接我
A criminal, of all people, to come and fetch me?

722
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,110
我是那么爱你母亲 彼得
I loved your mother, Peter!

723
00:53:56,110 --> 00:54:00,120
我无法忍受去一个再没有她的地球
I couldn't stand to set foot on an Earth where she wasn't living!

724
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,410
你无法想象那是什么感觉
You can't imagine what that's like!

725
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:03,670
我非常清楚那是什么感觉
I know exactly what that feels like!

726
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,010
我不得不看着她死去
I had to watch her die!

727
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,820
我存在了千百万年
Over the millions and millions of years of my existence

728
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,000
犯下了很多错误 彼得
I've made many mistakes, Peter.

729
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,800
但你不是其中之一
But you're not one of them.

730
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,310
请给我个机会
Please give me the chance

731
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:25,590
做她会希望我做的那种父亲
to be the father she would want me to be.

732
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:35,460
关于这个星球 和其内部的光
There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet

733
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,520
我有好多要告诉你
and the light within.

734
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:40,460
那是你的一部分 彼得
They are a part of you, Peter.

735
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:42,970
什么意思
What do you mean?

736
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:45,920
给我你的手 儿子
Give me your hands, son.

737
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:48,220
来
Here.

738
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:50,920
这样端住
Hold them like that.

739
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:54,980
好了
Now,

740
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,780
闭上眼睛 集中精神
close your eyes and concentrate.

741
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,690
让思绪进入星球的中心
Take your brain to the center of this planet.

742
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,100
太好了
Yes!

743
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:11,370
就这样
Yes!

744
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:13,050
太好了
Yes! Yes!

745
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:14,570
- 太棒了 没事  - 怎么回…
- Yes! It's okay.  - What was...

746
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:16,170
放松 集中精神
Just relax. Concentrate.

747
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:17,890
你可以的 再来
You can do it. Bring it back.

748
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:19,630
很好
Yes!

749
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:24,140
很好 好了 塑形
Yes, yes, now shape it.

750
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,800
感受那股能量
Feel that energy.

751
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,550
就这样
Yes.

752
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,730
你回家了
You're home.

753
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,560
彼得
Peter...

754
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:18,180
你是怎么来到这颗奇怪 愚蠢的星球上的
How did you get to this weird, dumb planet?

755
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:21,230
我还是个幼虫时被伊戈发现
Ego found me in my larva state.

756
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,520
我在母星是个孤儿
Orphaned on my homeworld.

757
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:27,810
他亲手养大了我 把我留在了身边
He raised me by hand, and kept me as his own.

758
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:30,090
那么你是个宠物
So you're a pet?

759
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,450
大概是吧
I suppose.

760
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,940
人们一般都养可爱的宠物
People usually want cute pets.

761
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:38,540
伊戈怎么会养个这么面目可憎的
Why would Ego want such a hideous one?

762
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:40,290
我面目可憎吗
I am hideous?

763
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:43,020
你简直丑得惊心动魄
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.

764
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,140
但那是好事
But that's a good thing.

765
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,000
如果你长得丑 还有人爱你
When you're ugly, and someone loves you

766
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,940
你知道那人是爱你这个人
you know they love you for who you are.

767
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,400
美丽的人永远不知道谁能信任
Beautiful people never know who to trust.

768
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,700
那我庆幸我很丑
Well, then I'm certainly grateful to be ugly.

769
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:04,890
那些池塘 让我想起了有次
Those pools, they remind me of a time...

770
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:08,340
我带女儿去我母星的遗忘湖
when I took my daughter to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.

771
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,200
她跟你很像
She was like you.

772
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,710
难看吗
Disgusting?

773
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,010
天真无邪
Innocent.

774
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,860
德拉克斯
Drax?

775
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,610
我得告诉你件事
There's something I must tell you.

776
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,100
怎么回事
What's going on?

777
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:04,420
这位恶心的虫子女士成了我的新朋友
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

778
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:07,560
我学到了很多事 比如我是个宠物 而且很丑
I'm learning many things, like I'm a pet and ugly.

779
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,200
你不丑 德拉克斯
You're not ugly. Drax!

780
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,360
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

781
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,370
螳螂
Mantis...

782
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:14,630
你能带我们去我们的住处吗
can you show us where we'll be staying?

783
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,650
这颗星球上怎么没有其他生物
Why are there no other beings on this planet?

784
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:19,770
这星球就是伊戈
The planet is Ego.

785
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:22,900
狗不会邀请跳蚤来他背上住
A dog would not invite a flea to live on his back.

786
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,370
你不是跳蚤
And you're not a flea?

787
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,320
我是有用的跳蚤
I'm a flea with a purpose.

788
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,820
我帮他入眠
I help him sleep.

789
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:33,150
我走出来之前 你正要跟德拉克斯说什么
What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?

790
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:39,430
没什么
Nothing.

791
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:42,040
你们的住处在这边
Your quarters are this way.

792
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,420
我们明早把你们送去给克里人
We deliver you to the Kree in the morning.

793
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:58,560
之后你俩都活不长了
Neither one of you will last much longer after that.

794
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:01,180
好啊 电击脸
Okay, Taserface.

795
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:06,020
替我们跟其他人问好 电击脸
Tell the other guys we said "Hi," Taserface!

796
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:13,710
这颗小植物呢 要我用石头砸碎它吗
What about this little plant? Can I smash it with a rock?

797
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:15,200
不行 杰夫
No, Gef.

798
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,910
这么可爱怎么能杀掉
It's too adorable to kill.

799
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:18,680
送去裁缝那里
Take it to the tailor.

800
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,640
别介意 但你的雇员都是混蛋
No offense, but your employees are a bunch of jerks.

801
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,310
我做了二十年的克里人战奴 是斯塔卡解救了我
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years when Stakar freed me.

802
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,790
他邀我加入了掠夺者
He offered me a place with the Ravagers.

803
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,020
他说我只需要遵守准则
He said all I needed to do was adhere to the code.

804
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:42,620
但我年轻
But I was young...

805
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:47,240
贪心 愚蠢
and greedy, and stupid.

806
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:50,390
就像你 偷了那些电池
Like you stealing those batteries.

807
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,060
那更多是德拉克斯干的
That was mostly Drax.

808
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:56,530
我和斯塔卡 还有其他船长
Me and Stakar and the other captains...

809
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:00,480
我们跟你和你的朋友很像
we weren't so different from you and your friends.

810
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,400
那是我唯一的家庭
The only family I ever had.

811
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:06,130
我违反准则后
When I broke the code...

812
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,990
他们流放了我
they exiled me.

813
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,180
我活该如此
This is what I deserve.

814
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,190
等等 矫情女王
Slow down, drama queen.

815
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:16,750
你或许是活该 但我不是
You might deserve this, but I don't.

816
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,150
我们得逃出去
We gotta get outta here.

817
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:21,290
奎尔呢
Where's Quill?

818
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:23,800
他跟他老爸走了
He went off with his old man.

819
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:26,380
- 伊戈  - 对
- Ego?  - Yeah.

820
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:28,550
今天净是些蠢蛋名字
It's a day for dumbass names.

821
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:34,330
你笑了 就那么一刻 我有种温暖的感觉
You're smiling. And for a second, I got a warm feeling.

822
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:37,060
但你那一口烂牙毁了这感觉
But then it was ruined by those disgusting-ass teeth.

823
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,590
你是职业混蛋吗
You like a professional asshole or what?

824
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:40,650
挺专业的反正
Pretty much a pro.

825
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:43,440
你为什么没像说好的那样把奎尔送去给伊戈
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego like you promised?

826
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,450
他很瘦小
He was skinny.

827
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:50,060
能钻进我们钻不进的地方 适合偷盗
Could fit into places we couldn't. Good for thievin'.

828
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:57,970
我知道我们怎么出去了
I got an idea on how to get outta here.

829
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:01,520
但我需要你的小朋友
But we're gonna need your little friend.

830
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,620
吉祥物 吉祥物
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

831
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:19,120
小家伙好激动 该喝一杯
Little fellow's all worked up! He needs a drink!

832
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:27,850
看他气成那样多可爱
Look how cute it is when it's all riled up.

833
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,200
他太有趣了
He's goddang precious!

834
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:44,960
小树枝
Hey, twig!

835
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:46,750
过来
Come here.

836
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:48,640
过来
Come on.

837
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,150
天呐 他们把你怎么了
Man... what did they do to you?

838
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,250
你想帮我们出去吗
You wanna help us get outta here?

839
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:07,540
我需要你去找样东西 然后拿来给我
There's something I need you to get, and bring back to me.

840
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:12,120
在船长室 有个原型机机械鳍
In the captain's quarters, there's a prototype fin...

841
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:14,160
就是我脑袋上戴的那玩意
the thing I wore on my head.

842
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:18,650
床铺旁边有个抽屉 就在里面 红色的
There's a drawer next to the bunk. It's in that. It's red.

843
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:19,650
懂了吗
You got it?

844
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:55,370
那是我的内裤
That's my underwears.

845
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:56,140
嗯 我就觉得
Yeah, I was pretty sure

846
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:57,580
他根本就没听懂你说什么
he didn't know what you were talkin' about.

847
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,600
你得解释得更细致点
You have to explain it more careful.

848
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,690
是个原型机机械鳍
It's a prototype fin.

849
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:12,960
那是只奥罗尼 机械鳍 格鲁特
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.

850
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,710
这次你来解释
You explain it this time.

851
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:16,620
好吧
All right.

852
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,180
那是沃克的眼睛
That's Vorker's eye.

853
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:22,220
他睡觉时会拿下来
He takes it out when he sleeps.

854
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:23,520
去 再找
Go. Look again.

855
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,000
把眼睛留下
But leave the eye here.

856
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:26,720
干吗
Why?

857
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:28,500
等他明早醒来
He's gonna wake up tomorrow

858
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:30,510
会不知道
and he's not gonna know

859
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,820
他的眼睛去哪了
where his eye is!

860
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,800
那是张桌子
That's a desk.

861
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:43,220
我们说了那玩意才这么大
We told you it was this big.

862
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,000
拜托告诉我你们船上有个冰箱
Tell me you guys have a refrigerator somewhere

863
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,160
里面全是切下来的人脚趾
with a bunch of severed human toes.

864
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:58,020
好吧 那我们说好永远不再提这事了
Okay. Then let's just agree to never discuss this.

865
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,770
你要打开的抽屉 上面有这个标志
The drawer you wanna open has this symbol on it.

866
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:06,750
好吗
Okay?

867
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,100
什么 不
What? No!

868
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,780
他以为你要他把那个当帽子戴
He thinks you want him to wear it as a hat.

869
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:20,370
我不是那么说的
That's not what I said!

870
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:22,550
- 我是格鲁特  - 他很庆幸你不要求他那么做
- I am Groot.  - He's relieved you don't want him to.

871
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:24,350
- 我是格鲁特  - 他讨厌帽子
- I am Groot.  - He hates hats.

872
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:25,140
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

873
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,550
讨厌任何人戴帽子 不仅是他自己
On anyone, not just himself.

874
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:27,290
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

875
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:29,110
你还以为谁的脑袋形状很怪
One minute you think someone has a weird-shaped head

876
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:30,110
结果转眼发现
the next minute it's just because

877
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:32,030
原来那脑袋上戴了顶帽子
you realize part of that head is the hat.

878
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,930
所以你才不喜欢帽子
That's why you don't like hats?

879
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:37,090
这些话非得现在说吗
This is an important conversation right now?

880
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:15,360
不是那个
That ain't it.

881
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:26,590
我并没想哗变的
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

882
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:31,170
他们杀了我所有的朋友
They killed all my friends.

883
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:37,760
准备释放第三飞行舱
Get the third quadrant ready for release.

884
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,830
还有件事
One more thing.

885
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,710
船上有奎尔那些老歌的备份吗
You got any clones of Quill's old music on the ship?

886
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:41,520
他拿走了
He's got it!

887
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,280
勇度拿走了机械鳍
Yondu's got the fin!

888
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,240
上
Go!

889
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,200
下面
Down there!

890
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:27,350
你个疯子
You maniac.

891
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,040
你会炸掉整艘船的
The whole ship's gonna blow.

892
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,520
不会是整艘船
Not the whole ship.

893
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:00,530
你是谁
Who is this?

894
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:04,700
我要把勇度的飞船的坐标发你
I am sending you the coordinates for Yondu's ship.

895
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,390
- 释放飞行舱  - 是 船长
- Release the quadrant!  - Aye, Captain!

896
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:09,850
我只求一件事
I only ask one thing.

897
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,340
你们的大祭司
That your High Priestess

898
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:16,110
要告诉他是谁注定了他的毁灭
tell him the name of the man what sealed his fate.

899
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:18,770
电击脸
Taserface!

900
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:43,550
去哪 船长
Where to, Captain?

901
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,600
伊戈
Ego.

902
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,720
不行
No, boy!

903
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,220
对于哺乳类来说
It ain't healthy for a mammalian body

904
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,920
一下跳跃五十次以上对身体有害
to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.

905
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,120
我知道
I know that.

906
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:03,870
我们要跳七百次了
We are about to do 700!

907
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:19,770
那么这一切有一天都可能属于我喽
So I guess this could all be mine someday.

908
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:23,620
火箭 火箭 你在吗
Rocket? Rocket, are you there?

909
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:31,880
你在干什么 彼得
What are you doing, Peter?

910
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:35,770
跟我跳舞吧
Dance with me.

911
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,690
我才不跟你跳舞
I'm not going to dance with you.

912
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:39,520
这是山姆·库克的歌
This is Sam Cooke

913
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:42,640
他可是地球最伟大的歌手之一
one of the greatest Earth singers of all time.

914
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:14,360
德拉克斯觉得你不是个舞者
Drax thinks you're not a dancer.

915
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:18,340
你要是敢把这件事说出去
If you ever tell anyone about this...

916
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:19,470
我就杀了你
I will kill you.

917
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,960
我们什么时候处理一下
When are we gonna do something about this

918
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:23,930
我们之间心照不宣的情愫啊
unspoken thing between us?

919
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:26,560
什么心照不宣的情愫
What unspoken thing?

920
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:28,930
就是
This...

921
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,530
像《欢乐酒店》里 萨姆和黛安那样
Cheers, Sam and Diane...

922
01:12:32,650 --> 01:12:35,330
电视剧里相互喜欢的一男一女
a guy and a girl on a TV show who dig each other...

923
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:37,900
但他们从不说破 否则收视率就要下降了
but never say it because if they do, the ratings would go down...

924
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,050
就这种的
sort of thing.

925
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:40,770
才没有什么心照不宣的情愫
There's no unspoken thing.

926
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:44,730
这是二十二条军规 如果你说了
Well, it's a catch-22, because if you said it,

927
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:45,690
那就不叫心照不宣了
then it would be spoken

928
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:48,750
那你就是撒谎了 所以你不说
and you would be a liar. So, by not saying it...

929
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,830
反而是在说实话 也就是承认有
you are telling the truth, and admitting that there is.

930
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,160
不 我不是那个…
No, that's not what I...

931
01:12:57,650 --> 01:12:59,670
我们现在应该说的
What we should be discussing right now

932
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:01,650
是这地方
is something about this place.

933
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,480
有点不对劲
It doesn't feel right.

934
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:05,490
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

935
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,010
是你希望我来的
You're the one who wanted me to come here!

936
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:09,150
那个螳螂女
That girl Mantis

937
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:10,580
她在怕什么
she's afraid of something.

938
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:12,980
你为什么要夺走这一切
Why are you trying to take this away from me?

939
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:14,060
我没有…
I'm not trying...

940
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:16,040
他是我父亲 是我的血亲
He's my father. He's blood.

941
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,870
你在地球也有血亲 你可不想回那儿去
You have blood on Earth and you never wanted to return there.

942
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:19,800
再说一遍 是你逼我来的
Again, you made me come here!

943
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,200
而且地球 地球是我母亲死在我面前的地方
And Earth, Earth is the place where my mother died in front of me.

944
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,480
不 是因为那里是真实的 这里只是个幻想
No, it's because that place is real, and this is a fantasy.

945
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,240
这是真的 我是个半人 记得吗
This is real! I'm only half human, remember?

946
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,000
我担心的就是那一半
That's the half I'm worried about.

947
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:31,750
我懂了 你嫉妒
I get it. You're jealous

948
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:34,630
因为我是半神 而你喜欢我比较弱的时候
because I'm part-god, and you like when I'm the weak one.

949
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:37,150
你本就让人难以忍受
You were insufferable to begin with.

950
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:38,550
我一直联系不上火箭
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.

951
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:40,180
我要出去 看看能不能搜到信号
I'm gonna go outside, and I'm gonna try and get a signal.

952
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:43,180
知道吗 这根本不是《欢乐酒店》
You know what? This is not Cheers after all!

953
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:44,820
在这部剧里
This is whatever the show is

954
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:47,880
一个人愿意敞开心扉面对新的前景
where one person is willing to open themselves up to new possibility,

955
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:49,960
而另一个人却是个混蛋
and the other person is a jerk

956
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:51,640
不信任任何人
who doesn't trust anybody!

957
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,550
这是部不存在的剧
It's a show that doesn't exist.

958
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:55,540
所以它不会有任何收视率
That's why it would get zero ratings!

959
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:57,670
我不知道《欢乐酒店》是什么
I don't know what Cheers is!

960
01:13:57,670 --> 01:14:01,070
我终于找到我的家人了 你不懂吗
I finally found my family. Don't you understand that?

961
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,610
我以为你已经有家人了
I thought you already had.

962
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:34,450
该死
Damn it.

963
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,070
神经病
Psychopath!

964
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:20,510
你搞什么
Are you kidding me?

965
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:48,570
我赢了
I win.

966
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:50,700
我赢了 我打败了你
I win. I bested you in combat.

967
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:53,050
不 是我救了你
No. I saved your life.

968
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:55,160
你留我一命真是太蠢了
Well, you were stupid enough to let me live.

969
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:55,980
是你没下杀手
You let me live!

970
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:58,000
我不需要你总想打赢我
I don't need you always trying to beat me!

971
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,850
我可没刚刚穿越宇宙
I'm not the one that just flew across the universe

972
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:00,870
就为了争个输赢
just because I wanted to win.

973
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:02,590
用不着你告诉我我要什么
Do not tell me what I want.

974
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:04,380
我不用告诉你你要什么
I don't need to tell you what you want!

975
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:04,890
明摆着的
It's obvious!

976
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:08,460
你才是想赢的那个 我只想要个姐姐
You were the one who wanted to win. And I just wanted a sister!

977
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:17,820
我只有你
You were all I had.

978
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,400
但你总想赢
But you were the one who needed to win.

979
01:18:23,290 --> 01:18:25,380
灭霸把我的眼睛挖出来
Thanos pulled my eye from my head

980
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:27,920
把我的大脑取出来
and my brain from my skull

981
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:31,060
把我的胳膊拽下来
and my arm from my body

982
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:34,520
都是因为你
because of you.

983
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:57,350
你没事吧 儿子
You all right, son?

984
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:03,580
我之前看见你女朋友怒气冲冲地走了
I saw your girl stomp off a little earlier in quite a huff.

985
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:04,500
是啊
Yeah.

986
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:08,150
你听这首歌真巧
It's fortuitous you listening to this song.

987
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:10,370
- 你知道…  - 《布兰迪》
- You know...  - Brandy?

988
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:12,040
镜子组合的
By Looking Glass?

989
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:15,120
是你妈妈的最爱
A favorite of your mom's.

990
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:17,230
是啊
Yeah, it was.

991
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:19,660
是地球最伟大的音乐作品之一
One of Earth's greatest musical compositions.

992
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,700
也许就是最伟大的
Perhaps its very greatest.

993
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:22,770
说得太对了
Yeah, yes!

994
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:26,700
彼得 你我就是那首歌里的水手
Peter, you and I, we're the sailor in that song.

995
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:30,230
他在一个夏日出现
He came on a summer's day.

996
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,230
带来远方的礼物
Bringing gifts from far away.

997
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:37,300
就像我让你妈妈怀上的那个孩子
Like the child I put in your mother...

998
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,840
或是你给卡魔拉的自由
or the freedom you brought Gamora.

999
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:44,980
布兰迪 你是个好姑娘
Brandy, you're a fine girl.

1000
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,510
你肯定会是个好妻子
What a good wife you would be.

1001
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:51,520
我的生活 我的爱
My life, my love.

1002
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,460
我的女人是大海
My lady is the sea.

1003
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:57,130
大海召唤着水手
The sea calls the sailor back.

1004
01:19:57,130 --> 01:20:00,090
他爱那姑娘 但那里不是他的天地
He loves the girl, but that's not his place.

1005
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,960
大海召唤他 就像历史召唤伟人
The sea calls upon him as history calls upon great men.

1006
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:09,350
有时我们无法享受凡人的乐趣
And sometimes we are deprived the pleasures of mortals.

1007
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:11,950
你可能不是凡人 但我
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...

1008
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:13,050
不 彼得
No, Peter...

1009
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:15,670
只要这颗星球内的光不熄
death will remain a stranger to both of us

1010
01:20:15,670 --> 01:20:18,050
我们就都不用面对死亡
as long as the light burns within the planet.

1011
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:19,880
我可以永生不死
I'm immortal?

1012
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:23,160
真的吗
Really?

1013
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,260
对 只要光还在
Yes! As long as the light exists.

1014
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:30,940
我可以用那光建造很酷的东西 就像
And I can use the light to build cool things like

1015
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:32,780
你当初建造这颗星球那样
how you made this whole planet?

1016
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:35,350
你可能要花几百万年时间去练习
It might take you a few million years of practice

1017
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:37,700
才能得心应手 但 没错
before you get really good at it. But, yes!

1018
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:39,430
什么 这太
What! This is...

1019
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:42,300
准备见识一个八百英尺的吃豆人雕像吧
Well, get ready for an 800-foot statue of Pac-Man

1020
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,130
旁边还有骷髅王[动画形象]和希瑟·拉克里尔[女星]
with Skeletor and Heather Locklear.

1021
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:44,830
你想干什么都行
You can do anything you want.

1022
01:20:44,830 --> 01:20:46,980
我要做一些奇怪的东西
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

1023
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:50,230
但是 彼得 这是巨大的责任
But you know, Peter, it is a tremendous responsibility.

1024
01:20:50,230 --> 01:20:52,950
只有我们能重塑宇宙
Only we can remake the universe.

1025
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:55,920
只有我们能牵着宇宙的缰绳
Only we can take the bridle of the cosmos

1026
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,060
领导它走向正确的方向
and lead it to where it needs to go.

1027
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:00,520
怎么做
How?

1028
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:12,130
跟我来
Come with me.

1029
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,450
德拉克斯 德拉克斯
Drax, Drax. Drax!

1030
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:26,300
德拉克斯 我们得谈谈
Drax! We need to talk.

1031
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,550
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1032
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:32,590
但我喜欢稍微有点肉的女人
But I like a woman with some meat on her bones.

1033
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:33,640
什么
What?

1034
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:35,180
我说我觉得你恶心
I tried to let you down easily

1035
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:37,230
就是不想让你太伤心
by telling you I found you disgusting.

1036
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:38,840
不 我不是想…
No, that's not what I...

1037
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,400
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1038
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:46,650
我在想象跟你有肌肤之亲
I'm imagining being with you physically.

1039
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:48,290
德拉克斯 我不是想
Drax... That's not...

1040
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:49,860
我对你不是那种喜欢
I don't like you like that.

1041
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:52,470
我都不喜欢你这个物种
I don't even like the type of thing you are.

1042
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:54,650
没必要人身攻击
There's no need to get personal.

1043
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:57,800
听着 伊戈得到了他想要的
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted.

1044
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,220
我应该早点告诉你的
I should have told you earlier.

1045
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:00,600
我真傻
I'm stupid.

1046
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:02,720
你们有危险了
You are in danger.

1047
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:09,960
那是什么
What is that?

1048
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:16,910
你得重新调整你看待生命的方式
Now, you need to readjust the way you process life.

1049
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:19,940
我们身边的一切 包括那个姑娘
Everything around us, including the girl...

1050
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:23,410
一切都是暂时的
Everything is temporary.

1051
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:26,240
我们才是永恒
We are forever.

1052
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:28,040
永恒不会无聊吗
Doesn't eternity get boring?

1053
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,170
如果你有目标就不会 彼得
Not if you have a purpose, Peter,

1054
01:22:30,170 --> 01:22:32,530
你来这儿就是为了那个目标
which is why you're here.

1055
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:35,240
我告诉过你 很多年前
I told you how all those years ago

1056
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:39,260
我有一股不灭的冲动 想找到生命
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.

1057
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,750
但我没告诉你的是
But what I did not tell you was how,

1058
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:43,550
当我终于找到它的时候
when I finally did find it...

1059
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:45,750
它是那么的
it was all so...

1060
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,260
令人失望
disappointing.

1061
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:53,030
那时我才
And that is when I came...

1062
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:57,860
深深地顿悟了
to a profound realization.

1063
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:03,230
我内心寻找其他生命的渴望
My innate desire to seek out other life

1064
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:07,960
不是为了让我能游走于那生命之间
was not so that I could walk among that life.

1065
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,020
彼得
Peter...

1066
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:15,340
我找到了意义
I have found meaning.

1067
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,470
我看见了
I see it.

1068
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:40,630
永恒
Eternity!

1069
01:23:41,290 --> 01:23:42,640
天啊
Oh, my God.

1070
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:55,230
我们得离开这颗星球
We need to get off this planet.

1071
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,060
天啊
Oh, man.

1072
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:13,010
总之 我被粗鲁地打断之前我正在说…
Anyway, before I was so rudely interrupted...

1073
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:16,220
那时 我是个联邦快递的快递员
At that time, I was a Federal Express man.

1074
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:29,240
你干什么呢 小子
What the hell you doing, boy?

1075
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,080
从你说到他时的样子我看得出
I could tell by how you talked about him

1076
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,790
这个伊戈不是好人
this Ego is bad news.

1077
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:34,650
我们得来救奎尔
We're here to save Quill.

1078
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:36,060
为了什么
For what?

1079
01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:38,070
荣誉吗
For honor?

1080
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,040
爱吗
For love?

1081
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,570
不 我才不在乎那些
No. I don't care about those things.

1082
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:44,500
我想救奎尔 好证明我比他强
I wanna save Quill so I can prove I'm better than him!

1083
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:47,650
我能拿这事压他一辈子
I can lord this over him forever.

1084
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:50,850
你笑我做什么
What are you laughing at me for?

1085
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:56,030
你可以骗自己和其他所有人 但你骗不了我
You can fool yourself and everyone else, but you can't fool me.

1086
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:57,820
我了解你
I know who you are.

1087
01:24:57,830 --> 01:25:00,260
你才不了解我呢 废物
You don't know anything about me, loser.

1088
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:02,600
我了解你的一切
I know everything about you.

1089
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:05,580
我知道你假装是最坏最狠的人
I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest,

1090
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:07,440
但你其实最害怕
but, actually, you're the most scared of all.

1091
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:07,940
闭嘴
Shut up!

1092
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:10,640
我知道你偷你用不着的电池
I know you steal batteries you don't need

1093
01:25:10,650 --> 01:25:13,050
你推开每一个愿意忍受你的人
and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you

1094
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:14,810
因为哪怕一点点爱
because just a little bit of love

1095
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:18,530
也会提醒你 你内心的空虚多大多深
reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is.

1096
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:19,470
我叫你闭嘴了
I said shut up!

1097
01:25:19,470 --> 01:25:21,450
我知道那些制造了你的科学家
I know them scientists what made you,

1098
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,460
根本没在乎过你
never gave a rat's ass about you.

1099
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:24,320
我说真的 哥们
I'm serious, dude!

1100
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:27,780
就像我自己的父母 他们把我
Just like my own damn parents who sold me

1101
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:30,230
他们的亲生儿子 卖去做奴隶
their own little baby, into slavery.

1102
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:32,760
我知道你是什么人 小子
I know who you are, boy.

1103
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,660
因为你是我
Because you're me.

1104
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,330
我们是一对儿什么样的人啊
What kind of a pair are we?

1105
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:47,670
大概是一对儿要去对付一颗星球的人吧
The kind that's about to go fight a planet, I reckon.

1106
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:50,270
好啊 好嘞 很好
All right, okay! Good.

1107
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,340
等等
Wait.

1108
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:52,580
对付什么
Fight a what?

1109
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:58,180
你们是什么人
Who are you people?

1110
01:25:58,180 --> 01:25:58,930
这地方是什么
What is this place?

1111
01:25:58,930 --> 01:26:00,500
卡魔拉 放了她
Gamora, let her go!

1112
01:26:00,630 --> 01:26:03,060
洞里的尸体 他们是谁
The bodies in the caverns... Who are they?

1113
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:05,140
你在害怕
You are scared.

1114
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:11,540
我称之为扩张
I call it the Expansion.

1115
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:14,280
这是我的目标
It is my purpose

1116
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:15,400
现在
and now

1117
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:19,590
它也是你的目标了
it is yours as well.

1118
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:21,960
好美啊
It's beautiful.

1119
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,360
数千年来
Over thousands of years,

1120
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:29,000
我将数千个我的延伸根植在了
I implanted thousands of extensions of myself

1121
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,530
数千个世界上
on thousands of worlds.

1122
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:35,780
我得实现生命唯一真正的目标
I need to fulfill life's one true purpose...

1123
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:37,940
生长 传播
To grow and spread

1124
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:41,160
覆盖一切存在
covering all that exists

1125
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:45,430
直到一切都
until everything is...

1126
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:47,580
变成我
Me!

1127
01:26:48,290 --> 01:26:49,840
她对我做了什么
What did she do to me?

1128
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:52,410
她已经把一切都告诉我了
She already told me everything.

1129
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:54,970
我只有一个问题
I only had one problem.

1130
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:57,440
一个天神
A single Celestial

1131
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,270
是没有足够能量完成这样的伟业的
doesn't have enough power for such an enterprise.

1132
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:03,250
但两个天神
But two Celestials...

1133
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:06,640
那或许就可以了
Well, now, that just might do.

1134
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:10,650
那些尸体
The bodies...

1135
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:12,970
都是他的孩子
are his children.

1136
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,130
我所做的一切中
Out of all my labors

1137
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,250
我最喜欢的
the most beguiling

1138
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:21,550
就是尝试将我的DNA嫁接到其他物种上
was attempting to graft my DNA with that of another species.

1139
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:24,130
我原本希望这样的配对
I hoped the result of such a coupling

1140
01:27:24,130 --> 01:27:26,710
足以为扩张提供能量
would be enough to power the Expansion.

1141
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:30,410
我让勇度把一些后代送来给我
I had Yondu deliver some of them to me.

1142
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:32,040
这有违掠夺者的准则
It broke the Ravager code,

1143
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:35,300
但我慷慨地赔偿了他
but I compensated him generously and

1144
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:37,830
而且为安抚他的良心 我说我绝不会伤害他们
to ease his conscience, I said I'd never hurt them.

1145
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,510
这倒不假 他们都毫无感觉
I mean, that was true. They never felt a thing.

1146
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:43,460
但他们一个个都让我失望了
But one after the other, they failed me.

1147
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:47,260
没有一个携带了天神基因
Not one of them carried the Celestial genes.

1148
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:49,290
直到你 彼得
Until you, Peter.

1149
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,640
我所有的后裔里
Out of all my spawn,

1150
01:27:53,230 --> 01:27:57,410
只有你继承了与光的联系
only you carried the connection to the light.

1151
01:27:57,610 --> 01:28:00,500
我们得马上找到彼得 离开这个破星球
We need to find Peter now, and get off this damn planet.

1152
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:03,180
伊戈现在肯定已经拉拢了他
Ego will have won him to his side by now.

1153
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:04,880
- 他有办法…  - 那我们直接走吧
- He has a way of...  - Then we just go.

1154
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:05,860
不行
No!

1155
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:06,980
他是我们的朋友
He's our friend.

1156
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:09,420
你们就成天冲彼此大吼
All any of you do is yell at each other.

1157
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:10,600
你们才不是朋友
You are not friends.

1158
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:11,670
你是对的
You're right.

1159
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:13,920
我们是家人
We're family.

1160
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,010
我们不丢下任何人
We leave no one behind.

1161
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:21,740
或许除了你
Except maybe you.

1162
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:23,920
天呐
Oh, my God.

1163
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,400
我存在以来首次
For the first time in my existence,

1164
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:29,760
真正不再孤单了
I am truly not alone!

1165
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,550
怎么了 儿子
What is it, son?

1166
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:41,130
我的朋友们
My friends.

1167
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:46,480
你瞧 这就是你人性的一面 彼得
You see, that's the mortal in you, Peter.

1168
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:47,970
是啊
Yes.

1169
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:50,860
我们超越了那些东西
We are beyond such things.

1170
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:51,890
是啊
Yes.

1171
01:28:54,610 --> 01:28:56,140
- 好了…  - 但我母亲…
- Now...  - But my mother...

1172
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,920
你说你爱我母亲的
You said you loved my mother.

1173
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,670
我是爱她
And that I did.

1174
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,540
我的水百合
My river lily who knew

1175
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:08,940
她会唱收音机里播放的每一首歌
all the words to every song that came over the radio.

1176
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:13,370
我三次回到地球看她
I returned to Earth to see her three times.

1177
01:29:13,370 --> 01:29:15,750
我知道 如果我再第四次回去
And I knew if I returned a fourth...

1178
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:17,550
我就再不会走了
I'd never leave.

1179
01:29:18,910 --> 01:29:20,060
扩张
The Expansion...

1180
01:29:22,010 --> 01:29:24,280
我存在的目的 就完了
the reason for my very existence, would be over.

1181
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:25,850
所以我做了我必须做的
So, I did what I had to do.

1182
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:27,760
但是
But

1183
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:32,420
让她患上脑瘤简直伤透了我的心
it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head.

1184
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:38,060
什么
What?

1185
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:39,130
好吧
Now, all right...

1186
01:29:39,130 --> 01:29:42,180
我知道这听上去很不好
I know that sounds bad.

1187
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:53,080
你
Who

1188
01:29:53,710 --> 01:29:57,170
以为你是谁啊
in the hell do you think you are?

1189
01:29:57,170 --> 01:29:59,090
你杀了我母亲
You killed my mother!

1190
01:29:59,090 --> 01:30:00,380
我
I tried...

1191
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:02,060
那么努力
so hard...

1192
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:06,010
找到最适合你的形态
to find the form that best suited you...

1193
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:09,200
这就是你的感谢吗
and this is the thanks I get?

1194
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:12,660
你真得长大了
You really need to grow up.

1195
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:18,870
我本想跟你一起做的
I wanted to do this together...

1196
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:21,070
但看来你只能
but I suppose you'll have to learn

1197
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:24,500
做个一千年的电池 慢慢长进了
by spending the next thousand years as a battery!

1198
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:28,490
可算 火箭
Finally! Rocket?

1199
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:31,190
把发射器带在身边 我好找你
Keep that transmitter nearby, so I can find you.

1200
01:30:31,190 --> 01:30:33,250
我们在一件旧施工设备里
We're in an old piece of construction equipment

1201
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:36,380
勇度曾用它来切开艾斯克维拉银行
Yondu once used to slice open the Bank of A'askavaria.

1202
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:37,370
伊戈是个疯子
Ego's unhinged.

1203
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:38,790
我知道 准备好
I know. Get ready.

1204
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:40,200
放 克拉林
Drop her, Kraglin.

1205
01:30:58,650 --> 01:30:59,890
不
No.

1206
01:31:11,110 --> 01:31:14,130
我的生命 我的爱
My life, my love.

1207
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:16,560
我的女人是大海
My lady is the sea

1208
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:19,420
彼得
Peter...

1209
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:22,710
这就是那海
this is the sea.

1210
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:07,620
你好啊 混蛋
Hey, there, jackass!

1211
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:19,240
那是什么玩意
What is that thing?

1212
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:29,050
闪开 小笨格鲁特
Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!

1213
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:35,990
我就说有点不对劲
I told you something didn't feel right.

1214
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:38,650
“我早说过”我现在正需要听这种话
"I told you so." Just what I need to hear right now.

1215
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:40,230
我不是回来了吗
Well, I came back, didn't I?

1216
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:42,420
因为我们有心照不宣的情愫
Because there's an unspoken thing.

1217
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:44,640
才没有什么心照不宣的情愫
There is no unspoken thing.

1218
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:47,060
你干什么呢 你差点害死我们
What are you doing? You could've killed us all!

1219
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:48,850
“谢谢 火箭”
"Thank you, Rocket"?

1220
01:32:48,850 --> 01:32:50,230
我们都控制局面了
We had it under control.

1221
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:53,920
我们没有 那只是他真身的延伸
We did not. That is only an extension of his true self.

1222
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,200
他很快就会回来的
He will be back soon.

1223
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,270
蓝妹妹怎么在这儿
What's Smurfette doing here?

1224
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:58,360
我只想搭车回家
Whatever I need to do to get a damn ride home.

1225
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:00,000
她还想杀我
She tried to murder me!

1226
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
我救了你 你个蠢狐狸
I saved you, you stupid fox!

1227
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,470
他不是狐狸
He's not a fox.

1228
01:33:03,470 --> 01:33:05,550
- 我是格鲁特  - 我也不是浣兔
- I am Groot.  - I'm not a raboon, either.

1229
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:06,830
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1230
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:08,600
是“浣熊” 算了
"Raccoon." Whatever.

1231
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:13,380
怎么杀一个天神啊
How do we kill a Celestial?

1232
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:14,790
他有个核
There's a center to him.

1233
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,170
他的大脑还是灵魂什么的
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...

1234
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:18,860
有个保护壳
Some sort of protective shell.

1235
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:21,440
在地表下的洞穴里
It's in the caverns below the surface.

1236
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:24,710
勇度
Yondu?

1237
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:35,380
推进器失去动力了
Thrusters are out.

1238
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:37,280
看来我该庆幸我长得瘦
Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid.

1239
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:39,540
否则你就会把我交给这个疯子了
Otherwise, you'd have delivered me to this maniac.

1240
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:42,080
你还以为那是我留下了你的原因吗 白痴
You still reckon that's the reason I kept you around, you idiot?

1241
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,140
是你这么跟我说的 你个老笨蛋
That's what you told me, you old doofus.

1242
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:46,400
我搞明白了其他孩子的下场后
Once I figured out what happened to them other kids

1243
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,120
我当然不能把你交出去
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.

1244
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,080
你说你要吃了我
You said you were gonna eat me.

1245
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,850
那是玩笑话
That was being funny!

1246
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:53,450
我可没想笑
Not to me!

1247
01:33:53,450 --> 01:33:55,030
你们真有毛病
You people have issues.

1248
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:57,150
我当然有毛病
Of course I have issues.

1249
01:33:57,550 --> 01:34:00,060
那可是我老爸
That's my freakin' father!

1250
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:02,140
推进器恢复了
Thrusters are back up.

1251
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:18,000
- 我们该向上飞  - 不行
- We should be going up!  - We can't!

1252
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
伊戈想毁掉我们所知的宇宙
Ego wants to eradicate the universe as we know it.

1253
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,170
我们得杀了他
We have to kill him.

1254
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:23,090
火箭
Rocket!

1255
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:23,970
好嘞
Got it!

1256
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:40,050
那我们又要拯救银河系了
So, we're saving the galaxy again?

1257
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:41,130
大概是吧
I guess.

1258
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:42,300
太棒了
Awesome!

1259
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:46,620
如果我们救了两次银河系
We're really gonna be able to jack up our prices

1260
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:48,550
就能坐地起价了
if we're two-time galaxy savers.

1261
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:51,270
我真不敢相信你居然想到了这个
I seriously can't believe that's where your mind goes.

1262
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:54,130
就是想想嘛 哥们 我们不是朋友嘛
It was just a random thought, man. I thought we were friends.

1263
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:56,630
我当然在乎那些星球啊 建筑啊
Of course, I care about the planets, and the buildings

1264
01:34:56,630 --> 01:34:58,750
和各个星球上的动物啊
and all the animals on the planets.

1265
01:34:58,750 --> 01:35:00,050
还有人呢
And the people.

1266
01:35:01,230 --> 01:35:05,650
那个坏脾气狗狗好可爱 他让我想死
The crabby puppy is so cute. He makes me wanna die!

1267
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:44,660
飞行员
Pilots...

1268
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:46,420
释放先遣队
release envoy units.

1269
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:51,990
我们的传感器感应到电池在星球地表下
Our sensors detect the batteries are below the surface of the planet.

1270
01:35:54,190 --> 01:35:55,190
下潜
Dive!

1271
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:13,950
船长
Captain?

1272
01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:15,240
船长
Captain?

1273
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:22,980
伊戈为什么找你来
Tell me why Ego wants you here?

1274
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,280
他需要我跟光的基因联系
He needs my genetic connection to the light

1275
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,070
来帮他毁灭宇宙
to help destroy the universe.

1276
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:29,280
他还想教我控制能量
He tried to teach me how to control the power.

1277
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:30,590
你能控制吗
So, could you?

1278
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:31,830
稍稍能吧
A little.

1279
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:33,330
我做了个能量球
I made a ball.

1280
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:34,730
球
A ball?

1281
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:36,700
我已经拼命去想了
I thought as hard as I could.

1282
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:38,310
我只能弄出来个那个
It was all that I could come up with.

1283
01:36:38,310 --> 01:36:39,390
你“想”
You "thought"?

1284
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:41,460
你以为我控制这支箭飞的时候
You think when I make this arrow fly

1285
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:42,930
是用的脑袋吗
I use my head?

1286
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:06,620
那儿
There.

1287
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:08,330
那就是伊戈的核
That's Ego's core.

1288
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:12,690
外壳很厚 火箭
That ore is thick, Rocket.

1289
01:37:12,730 --> 01:37:14,080
交给我吧
I got it covered.

1290
01:37:20,450 --> 01:37:21,820
我们必须快点
We must hurry.

1291
01:37:21,890 --> 01:37:24,440
伊戈很快就会找到我们
It will not take Ego long to find us.

1292
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:29,730
稳住
Keep it steady.

1293
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:38,400
钻透到核 然后杀死他
We drill into the center, we kill him!

1294
01:37:45,330 --> 01:37:46,250
船长
Captain?

1295
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:47,620
怎么了 克拉林
What is it, Kraglin?

1296
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,020
还记得阿耶莎那妞儿吗
Remember that Ayesha chick?

1297
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:51,120
记得 怎么了
Yeah, why?

1298
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:52,890
该死
Oh, hell!

1299
01:38:14,150 --> 01:38:15,990
你为什么不开激光炮
Why aren't you firing the lasers?

1300
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:17,900
他们炸掉了发电机
They blew out the generator.

1301
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:20,250
我记得我带了一个小引爆器
I think I packed a small detonator.

1302
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:22,470
有引爆器没炸药也没用
A detonator is worthless without explosives.

1303
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,200
我们有这些
Well, we got these.

1304
01:38:24,710 --> 01:38:26,830
这玩意的破坏性能杀死伊戈吗
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?

1305
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:29,010
如果能的话 会造成他整个
If it is, it'll cause a chain reaction

1306
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:30,870
神经系统的连锁反应
throughout his entire nervous system.

1307
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:31,660
意思是
Meaning what?

1308
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:33,680
整颗星球都会爆炸
The entire planet will explode.

1309
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,610
我们得快点逃出去
We'll have to get out of here fast.

1310
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:37,090
我装了个定时器
I rigged a timer.

1311
01:38:37,910 --> 01:38:38,710
走
Go!

1312
01:38:52,970 --> 01:38:54,690
他要来了
He's coming.

1313
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:58,150
你不是说你能让他睡着吗
Didn't you say you could make him sleep?

1314
01:38:58,510 --> 01:39:01,130
在他想睡的时候 他太强大了
When he wants. He's too powerful.

1315
01:39:01,130 --> 01:39:02,400
我做不到
I can't!

1316
01:39:02,930 --> 01:39:04,780
你不用相信自己
You don't have to believe in yourself

1317
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:07,440
因为我相信你
because I believe in you.

1318
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:21,110
睡吧
Sleep!

1319
01:39:28,110 --> 01:39:29,890
我没想到她能做到
I never thought she'd be able to do it

1320
01:39:30,070 --> 01:39:32,310
毕竟她一副很瘦弱的样子
with as weak and skinny as she appears to be.

1321
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:35,750
我不知道我能拖住他多久
I don't know how long I can hold him.

1322
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:40,880
金属太厚了
The metal's too thick.

1323
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,000
要让炸弹达到目的
For the bomb to work,

1324
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,910
我们得把它放在伊戈的核上
we'd actually need to place it on Ego's core.

1325
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:47,860
我们的大屁股钻不进这些小洞里
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit through those tiny holes.

1326
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:49,120
那么
Well...

1327
01:39:51,630 --> 01:39:53,190
这主意糟透了
That's a terrible idea.

1328
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:55,810
我们就剩这一个主意了
Which is the only kind of idea we have left.

1329
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:58,200
难以置信
Unbelievable.

1330
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:01,250
“火箭 做这个 火箭 做那个”
"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."

1331
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:03,470
今天真够受的
What a day.

1332
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:14,770
好了 首先你打开这个开关 再打开这个
All right, first you flick this switch, then this switch.

1333
01:40:14,770 --> 01:40:16,300
这样就启动了
That activates it.

1334
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:18,570
接着你按下这个按钮
Then you push this button

1335
01:40:18,580 --> 01:40:21,330
让你有五分钟时间逃跑
which will give you five minutes to get out of there.

1336
01:40:21,710 --> 01:40:23,350
不管你做什么
Now, whatever you do

1337
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:25,930
千万别按这个按钮
don't push this button

1338
01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:28,160
因为那样会立即引爆炸弹
because that will set off the bomb immediately

1339
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,710
我们就都没命了
and we'll all be dead.

1340
01:40:29,710 --> 01:40:32,330
重复一遍我刚才说的
Now, repeat back what I just said.

1341
01:40:32,660 --> 01:40:34,080
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1342
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,590
- 我是格鲁特  - 对了
- I am Groot.  - That's right.

1343
01:40:36,590 --> 01:40:38,190
- 我是格鲁特  - 不
- I am Groot.  - No!

1344
01:40:38,190 --> 01:40:40,520
不对 这个按钮会杀死所有人
No, that's the button that will kill everyone!

1345
01:40:40,930 --> 01:40:41,980
再来
Try again.

1346
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:45,860
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1347
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:47,920
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1348
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:49,860
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1349
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:51,820
不 你刚才就是这么错的
No! That's exactly what you just said!

1350
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:53,670
这怎么可能
How is that even possible?

1351
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:55,710
你应该按哪个按钮
Which button is the button you're supposed to push?

1352
01:40:55,710 --> 01:40:56,800
指一下
Point to it.

1353
01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:58,830
不对
No!

1354
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:00,470
你让他紧张了
You're making him nervous!

1355
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:02,370
闭嘴 给我拿点胶带来
Shut up and get me some tape!

1356
01:41:02,370 --> 01:41:04,020
外面有人有胶带吗
Does anybody have any tape out there?

1357
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:05,790
我要把死亡按钮贴上胶带
I wanna put some tape over the death button.

1358
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:08,120
我没胶带 我去问问
I don't have any tape. Let me check.

1359
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:11,390
勇度 你有…
Yo, Yondu... do you have...

1360
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,930
你有胶带吗
Do you have any tape?

1361
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,800
卡魔拉 你有胶带吗
Gamora? Do you have any tape?

1362
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:20,330
胶带
Tape!

1363
01:41:20,810 --> 01:41:21,930
算了
Never mind.

1364
01:41:23,870 --> 01:41:26,590
德拉克斯 你有胶带吗
Drax, do you have any tape?

1365
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:29,150
对 透明胶也行
Yes, scotch tape would work.

1366
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:31,740
既然你没有 为什么还要问我
Then why did you ask me if scotch tape would work,

1367
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:33,010
透明胶行不行
if you don't have any?

1368
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:35,520
没人有胶带
Nobody has any tape!

1369
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,630
谁都没有胶带吗
Not a single person has tape?

1370
01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:38,230
没有
Nope!

1371
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:39,940
你问过星云了吗
Did you ask Nebula?

1372
01:41:40,710 --> 01:41:41,400
问过了
Yes!

1373
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:42,600
你确定吗
Are you sure?

1374
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:43,950
我问勇度的时候
I asked Yondu...

1375
01:41:43,950 --> 01:41:46,670
- 她就坐在他旁边  - 我就知道你撒谎
- and she was sitting next to him.  - I knew you were lying!

1376
01:41:46,670 --> 01:41:49,580
你包里装着价值连城的电池还有一枚原子弹
You have priceless batteries and an atomic bomb in your bag.

1377
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:51,340
要说谁会带胶带 就是你了
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!

1378
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:55,030
我就想说这个 什么事都得我做
That's exactly my point! I have to do everything!

1379
01:41:55,030 --> 01:41:57,390
你浪费了多少时间
You are wasting a lot of time here!

1380
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:05,510
我们都要死了
We're all gonna die.

1381
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:09,890
后推进器又坏了
Rear thrusters are out again!

1382
01:42:09,890 --> 01:42:12,460
没那个发电机我们死定了
We're done for without that generator!

1383
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:27,360
银河护卫队
Guardians...

1384
01:42:28,110 --> 01:42:30,220
也许这对你们会是个安慰
perhaps it will provide you solace

1385
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:32,840
你们的死 不会毫无意义
that your deaths are not without purpose.

1386
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:34,700
而是会警告那些
They will serve as a warning

1387
01:42:34,710 --> 01:42:37,180
想要背叛我们的人
to all of those tempted with betraying us.

1388
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:40,670
别想耍索维林族
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

1389
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:45,740
会很疼的
This is gonna hurt.

1390
01:42:45,740 --> 01:42:47,300
光说不练
Promises, promises.

1391
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:10,940
不
No!

1392
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:15,530
不不不
No! No! No!

1393
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:20,380
要爆炸了
We're gonna blow!

1394
01:43:25,690 --> 01:43:28,030
彼得 不
Peter! No!

1395
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:48,340
怎么了
What?

1396
01:43:48,970 --> 01:43:50,700
你活像玛丽·波平斯
You look like Mary Poppins.

1397
01:43:51,110 --> 01:43:52,290
他酷吗
Is he cool?

1398
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:55,490
当然 他很酷
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

1399
01:43:56,550 --> 01:43:58,370
我是玛丽·波平斯哦
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

1400
01:44:25,870 --> 01:44:27,540
螳螂 小心
Mantis, look out!

1401
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:41,300
她只是昏过去了
She's just unconscious.

1402
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:59,010
炸弹还有多久炸
How long until the bomb goes off?

1403
01:44:59,010 --> 01:45:01,760
万一万一格鲁特没把我们都炸死
In the unlikely event that Groot doesn't kill us all...

1404
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:03,290
那还有六分钟
about six minutes.

1405
01:45:07,930 --> 01:45:10,690
克拉林 我们需要飞行舱来带我们撤离
Kraglin, we need the quadrant for an extraction.

1406
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:11,470
倒计时五分钟
T-minus five minutes.

1407
01:45:11,470 --> 01:45:12,540
是 船长
Aye, Captain.

1408
01:45:16,610 --> 01:45:19,480
克拉林到时 上面得有人接应
Somebody's gotta be up top when Kraglin arrives.

1409
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,790
德拉克斯 带螳螂走
Drax, take Mantis.

1410
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:25,730
我的乳头
My nipples!

1411
01:45:33,630 --> 01:45:34,810
卡魔拉
Gamora!

1412
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:40,060
彼得
Peter!

1413
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:07,500
别想多了
Get over it.

1414
01:46:07,670 --> 01:46:11,500
得了 彼得 我知道你并不想这样
Come now, Peter. I know this isn't what you want.

1415
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:18,450
我让你做出这样的选择 还算什么父亲啊
What kind of father would I be to let you make this choice?

1416
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:49,060
帅气
Yeah!

1417
01:46:50,110 --> 01:46:54,010
很快 彼得 我们就将成为一切
Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.

1418
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:57,860
别再惹我生气了
So stop pissing me off!

1419
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,680
我们得上去撤离点
We have to get up to the extraction point!

1420
01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:28,140
冲
Go!

1421
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:29,170
我说过
I told you...

1422
01:49:29,410 --> 01:49:32,830
我不想一个人做
I don't want to do this alone.

1423
01:49:36,490 --> 01:49:38,140
你不能拒绝
You cannot deny

1424
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:42,180
宇宙赋予你的人生目的
the purpose the universe has bestowed upon you.

1425
01:49:51,050 --> 01:49:53,400
大家不要靠近
Everyone, I need you to stay back!

1426
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:54,660
那是什么
What is that?

1427
01:50:09,970 --> 01:50:12,290
不非得如此的 彼得
It doesn't need to be like this, Peter.

1428
01:50:13,790 --> 01:50:16,840
你为什么要毁掉我们的机会
Why are you destroying our chance?

1429
01:50:19,930 --> 01:50:22,880
别再否认自己的身份了
Stop pretending you aren't what you are.

1430
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:26,570
你是上亿
One in billions.

1431
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:29,640
上兆 甚至更多中的唯一
Trillions. Even more.

1432
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:36,590
生命怎么可能有更伟大的意义
What greater meaning can life possibly have to offer?

1433
01:50:39,020 --> 01:50:43,110
我不是用脑袋控制箭的 孩子
I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy!

1434
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:45,720
我是用心
I use my heart...

1435
01:51:20,690 --> 01:51:24,490
你不该杀了我妈妈 还捏碎我的随身听
You shouldn't have killed my mom, and squished my Walkman.

1436
01:52:04,860 --> 01:52:07,880
格鲁特 如果你听得到 快点
Groot? If you can hear me, hurry up!

1437
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:11,130
我不确定奎尔还能分散他注意力多久
I'm not sure how long Quill can keep him distracted!

1438
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:12,650
格鲁特 快点
Groot, hurry!

1439
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:11,140
勇度 我们要炸了
Yondu, we're about to blow!

1440
01:53:11,140 --> 01:53:12,550
上船
Get to the ship!

1441
01:53:12,730 --> 01:53:14,020
不能丢下奎尔
Not without Quill!

1442
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:16,250
你还得照顾小树枝
You need to take care of the twig!

1443
01:53:17,420 --> 01:53:19,140
不能丢下你
Not without you!

1444
01:53:20,380 --> 01:53:23,520
我这辈子都没做过几件好事 耗子
I ain't done nothin' right my whole damn life, rat.

1445
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:28,770
让我做这件吧
You need to give me this.

1446
01:53:39,490 --> 01:53:41,680
一套太空服和一个飞行装置
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

1447
01:53:42,090 --> 01:53:43,690
我一样只有一个
I only have one of each.

1448
01:53:56,590 --> 01:53:58,510
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1449
01:53:59,010 --> 01:54:00,110
他说什么
What's that?

1450
01:54:01,860 --> 01:54:06,110
他说“欢迎加入他娘的银河护卫队”
He says, "Welcome to the frickin' Guardians of the Galaxy."

1451
01:54:06,580 --> 01:54:08,690
而且他用的词不是“他娘的”
Only he didn't use "Frickin'."

1452
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:16,290
再见 小树枝
Bye, twig.

1453
01:54:18,190 --> 01:54:21,150
我们回头得好好谈谈你说粗话的问题
We're gonna need to have a real discussion about your language.

1454
01:55:16,490 --> 01:55:17,470
彼得呢
Where's Peter?

1455
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:19,710
火箭 他在哪
Rocket, where is he?

1456
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:21,900
火箭
Rocket.

1457
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:23,840
火箭 看着我 他在哪
Rocket, look at me! Where is he?

1458
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:32,590
不 我不能丢下他
No. I'm not leaving without him.

1459
01:55:39,510 --> 01:55:40,580
对不起
I'm sorry.

1460
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:43,710
我今天只能承受失去一个朋友
I can only afford to lose one friend today.

1461
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:46,240
克拉林 走
Kraglin, go!

1462
01:55:46,350 --> 01:55:47,160
等等
Wait...

1463
01:55:48,270 --> 01:55:49,310
奎尔回来了吗
Is Quill back?

1464
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:53,400
火箭 奎尔呢
Rocket, where's Quill?

1465
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:57,750
火箭 奎尔呢
Rocket, where's Quill?

1466
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:00,230
火箭
Rocket!

1467
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:03,380
奎尔呢
Where's Quill?

1468
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:06,400
奎尔呢
Where's Quill?

1469
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:16,520
不 我们得阻止它
No, we need to stop it.

1470
01:56:16,530 --> 01:56:18,010
我们得阻止它
We need to stop it.

1471
01:56:21,260 --> 01:56:23,180
不 停下
No. Stop.

1472
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:25,790
停下 听着 听我说
Stop. Listen. Listen to me!

1473
01:56:25,990 --> 01:56:27,530
你是个神
You are a god.

1474
01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:29,890
如果你杀了我
If you kill me...

1475
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:32,790
你就跟其他人一样了
you'll be just like everybody else.

1476
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:35,890
那有什么不好
What's so wrong with that?

1477
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:37,240
不
No!

1478
01:57:27,490 --> 01:57:31,330
他或许是你生父 孩子 但他可不是你爸爸
He may have been your father, boy, but he wasn't your daddy.

1479
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:37,850
真抱歉我一件事都没做对
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

1480
01:57:38,950 --> 01:57:40,850
你是我的孩子我太走运了
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

1481
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:45,880
什么
What?

1482
01:57:58,280 --> 01:57:59,610
勇度 你干什么
Yondu, what are you doing?

1483
01:57:59,740 --> 01:58:00,700
不行
You can't.

1484
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:03,470
勇度
Yondu!

1485
01:58:08,710 --> 01:58:09,550
不
No!

1486
01:58:10,290 --> 01:58:11,070
不
No!

1487
01:58:14,950 --> 01:58:15,910
不
No!

1488
01:58:19,150 --> 01:58:21,810
不不
No! No!

1489
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:24,540
不要
No!

1490
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:20,650
我告诉卡魔拉
I told Gamora

1491
01:59:20,650 --> 01:59:21,760
我小时候
how when I was a kid

1492
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:24,830
会假装大卫·霍索夫是我爸爸
I used to pretend David Hasselhoff was my dad.

1493
01:59:26,850 --> 01:59:29,890
他是地球的一个歌手演员 很出名
He's a singer and actor from Earth, really famous guy.

1494
01:59:31,770 --> 01:59:33,310
刚刚 我突然想到
Earlier, it struck me...

1495
01:59:34,550 --> 01:59:38,860
勇度没有会说话的车 但他有会飞的箭
Yondu didn't have a talking car, but he did have a flying arrow.

1496
01:59:39,540 --> 01:59:41,620
他没有天使般美丽的歌喉
He didn't have the beautiful voice of an angel

1497
01:59:41,630 --> 01:59:43,730
但他的哨声有如天籁
but he did have the whistle of one.

1498
01:59:44,270 --> 01:59:47,870
勇度和大卫·霍索夫都会经历牛逼的冒险
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff went on kick-ass adventures

1499
01:59:47,870 --> 01:59:49,590
勾搭性感的女人
and hooked up with hot women

1500
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:52,220
还打机器人
and fought robots.

1501
01:59:55,170 --> 01:59:58,580
看来大卫·霍索夫终究成为了我爸爸
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind of end up being my dad after all.

1502
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:01,250
但其实那是你 勇度
Only it was you, Yondu.

1503
02:00:07,170 --> 02:00:08,560
我有个很酷的爸爸
I had a pretty cool dad.

1504
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:13,750
我想说的是
What I'm trying to say here is...

1505
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:20,370
有时候你寻找了一生的东西
sometimes that thing you're searching for your whole life

1506
02:00:22,770 --> 02:00:24,700
其实一直在你身边
it's right there by your side all along.

1507
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:26,610
你却不自知
You don't even know it.

1508
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:40,450
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1509
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:43,590
他是喊你小树枝
He did call you twig.

1510
02:00:46,150 --> 02:00:47,170
星云
Nebula...

1511
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:54,060
我跟你一样只是个孩子
I was a child like you.

1512
02:00:55,390 --> 02:00:59,240
我每天只想着活到第二天
I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day.

1513
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:01,990
我从未想过灭霸对你做了什么
And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you.

1514
02:01:02,770 --> 02:01:04,110
我想弥补
I'm trying to make it right.

1515
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:07,370
整个宇宙中还有其他你这样的小女孩
There are little girls like you across the universe

1516
02:01:07,380 --> 02:01:08,910
她们有危险
who are in danger.

1517
02:01:11,260 --> 02:01:13,130
你可以留下 跟我们一起帮助她们
You can stay with us and help them.

1518
02:01:13,910 --> 02:01:16,170
我杀了灭霸就能帮助她们
I will help them by killing Thanos.

1519
02:01:16,470 --> 02:01:17,960
我不知道那是否能做到
I don't know if that's possible.

1520
02:01:33,310 --> 02:01:35,120
你永远是我妹妹
You will always be my sister.

1521
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:20,800
彼得
Pete!

1522
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:26,160
船长在一家旧货店为你找到了这个
Captain found this for you in a junker shop.

1523
02:02:26,170 --> 02:02:28,390
说你有一天会回来的
Said you'd come back to the fold someday.

1524
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:31,880
是什么
What is it?

1525
02:02:32,190 --> 02:02:32,970
叫Zune
It's called a Zune.

1526
02:02:32,970 --> 02:02:35,480
地球人现在都听这玩意了
It's what everybody's listening to on Earth nowadays.

1527
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:36,850
里面能存三百首歌
It's got 300 songs on it.

1528
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:39,080
三百首歌
300 songs?

1529
02:02:44,380 --> 02:02:45,170
等等
Wait.

1530
02:02:51,630 --> 02:02:53,490
火箭把残片捡走 重拼了起来
Rocket grabbed the pieces, and reassembled them.

1531
02:02:53,490 --> 02:02:55,630
我觉得勇度会希望留给你的
I think Yondu would want you to have it.

1532
02:02:59,450 --> 02:03:00,400
谢谢
Thanks...

1533
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:03,560
船长
Captain.

1534
02:04:16,050 --> 02:04:17,220
他们来了
They came.

1535
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:26,430
是什么
What is it?

1536
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:30,130
我给勇度以前的掠夺者朋友去了消息
I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager buddies,

1537
02:04:30,130 --> 02:04:31,680
把他做的事告诉了他们
and told them what he did.

1538
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:36,810
这是掠夺者的葬礼
It's a Ravager funeral.

1539
02:04:54,460 --> 02:04:56,080
好啊
Yeah!

1540
02:04:56,090 --> 02:04:57,410
好
Yeah!

1541
02:05:04,870 --> 02:05:06,900
他终究没有辜负我们 船长
He didn't let us down after all, Captain.

1542
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:09,260
是啊 孩子
No, he did not, son.

1543
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:12,070
他没有
He did not.

1544
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:22,240
永别了 老朋友
Fare thee well, old friend.

1545
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:28,680
勇度·尤冬塔 我们在群星中再会
Yondu Udonta, I will see you in the stars.

1546
02:05:33,090 --> 02:05:34,740
他没把他们赶走
He didn't chase them away.

1547
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:36,110
是啊
No.

1548
02:05:37,370 --> 02:05:39,080
虽然他吼他们
Even though he yelled at them.

1549
02:05:40,150 --> 02:05:41,650
总那么尖酸
And was always mean.

1550
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:46,140
还偷了他用不着的电池
And he stole batteries he didn't need.

1551
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:52,830
当然不会了
Well, of course not.

1552
02:06:17,450 --> 02:06:18,220
怎么了
What?

1553
02:06:19,350 --> 02:06:20,450
就是
It's just...

1554
02:06:23,030 --> 02:06:25,030
心照不宣的情愫
some unspoken thing.

1555
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:36,490
真美
It's beautiful.

1556
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:39,350
是啊
It is.

1557
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:42,320
你也很美
And so are you.

1558
02:06:45,210 --> 02:06:46,410
内在美
On the inside.

1559
02:07:15,390 --> 02:07:19,860
银河护卫队

1560
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:22,450
银河护卫队
还将回归

1561
02:08:41,780 --> 02:08:43,280
真是遗憾
You know, it's a shame...

1562
02:08:43,620 --> 02:08:46,150
要失去勇度这样的惨剧
that it took the tragedy of losing Yondu

1563
02:08:46,150 --> 02:08:47,980
才让我们重聚
to bring us all together again.

1564
02:08:48,330 --> 02:08:50,180
但我觉得如果他知道我们重新组队
But I think he'd be proud knowing that

1565
02:08:50,180 --> 02:08:52,030
一定会骄傲的
we are back as a team.

1566
02:08:52,350 --> 02:08:53,300
我加入
I'm in.

1567
02:08:53,390 --> 02:08:54,170
太好了
Dope.

1568
02:08:54,180 --> 02:08:56,550
我想死你们了
I miss you guys so much!

1569
02:08:56,550 --> 02:08:58,020
太好了
Hell, yes.

1570
02:09:00,870 --> 02:09:02,750
我们去偷点东西吧
What say we steal some shit?

1571
02:11:22,090 --> 02:11:24,650
大祭司 理事会在等您
High Priestess, the Council is waiting.

1572
02:11:25,330 --> 02:11:28,190
他们不满我浪费了资源
They are perturbed I've wasted our resources.

1573
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:34,760
等他们看到了我的创造
When they see what I have created here

1574
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:36,940
他们的愤怒就会消散
their wrath will dissipate.

1575
02:11:39,450 --> 02:11:42,430
是新型生育荚吗 夫人
It's a new type of birthing pod, ma'am?

1576
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:44,790
好孩子 那个
That, my child

1577
02:11:45,220 --> 02:11:47,140
是我们进化的下一步
is the next step in our evolution.

1578
02:11:47,370 --> 02:11:49,810
更强大 更美丽
More powerful, more beautiful,

1579
02:11:50,570 --> 02:11:54,360
更有能力摧毁银河护卫队
more capable of destroying the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1580
02:11:57,340 --> 02:11:59,050
我就叫他

If they found a way to penetrate Asgard's defenses once,

134
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,630
谁能保证他们不会卷土重来呢
who's to say they won't try again?

135
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,600
-下一次会带着军队来  -正是
- Next time with an army. - Exactly.

136
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,730
但你的任何行动  都会违背父王的意愿
There's nothing you can do without defying Father.

137
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,250
不不不  我了解这表情
No, no, no. I know that look.

138
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,700
这是确保我们防御安全的唯一方法
That's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders.

139
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,190
托尔  这是发疯
Thor, it's madness.

140
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,480
发疯  哪种程度的发疯
Madness? What sort of madness?

141
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,100
我们要去约顿海姆
We're going to Jotunheim.

142
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,830
什么
What?

143
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,000
这可不像去趟地球
This isn't like a journey to Earth

144
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,020
在那里你只要稍稍召唤些闪电雷鸣
where you summon a little lightning and thunder,

145
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,110
人类就会把你当成神来崇拜
and the mortals worship you as a god.

146
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,120
这可是约顿海姆
This is Jotunheim.

147
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,720
我父王曾一路攻入约顿海姆
My father fought his way into Jotunheim,

148
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,860
击败了他们的军队  带走了他们的远古冬棺
defeated their armies and took their Casket.

149
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,380
我们只是去寻求回应
We would just be looking for answers.

150
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,050
这是被禁止的
It is forbidden!

151
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,130
朋友们  你们忘了我们一起做过的事吗
My friends, have you forgotten all that we have done together?

152
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,290
范达尔  霍根
Fandral, Hogun.

153
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,400
是谁带你们加入了最光荣的战役
Who led you into the most glorious of battles?

154
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,810
是你
You did.

155
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,520
沃斯塔格  是谁给了你鲜美的佳肴
And Volstagg, to delicacies so succulent,

156
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,060
让你觉得欲仙欲死  仿佛升入了英灵殿呢
you thought you'd died and gone to Valhalla?

157
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,590
是你
You did.

158
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,470
没错
Yes!

159
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,650
又是谁向所有认为
And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea

160
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,250
少女不能成为王国最威猛的战士的人
that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors

161
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,600
证明了他们的错误呢
this realm has ever known?

162
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,660
是我
I did.

163
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,810
的确  但我一直支持你  希芙
True, but I supported you, Sif.

164
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,350
朋友们
My friends,

165
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,100
我们要去约顿海姆
we're going to Jotunheim.

166
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,960
交给我吧
You leave this to me.

167
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,890
-好海姆达尔...  -你们穿得不够暖
- Good Heimdall... - You're not dressed warmly enough.

168
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,370
你说什么
I'm sorry?

169
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,330
你们以为能瞒过我吗
Do you think that you can deceive me?

170
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,590
-你一定是搞错了  -够了
- You must be mistaken... - Enough!

171
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,830
海姆达尔  能让我们过去吗
Heimdall, may we pass?

172
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:56,810
从没有敌人能逃过我的眼睛  直到今天
Never has an enemy slipped my watch until this day.

173
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,790
我想知道究竟是怎么回事
I wish to know how that happened.

174
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,110
那就在我们回来之前
Then tell no one where we have gone

175
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,520
别告诉任何人我们的去向
until we've returned.

176
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,560
明白了吗
Understand?

177
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,570
怎么了  三寸不烂之舌打结了
What happened? Silver tongue turn to lead?

178
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,520
我警告你们
Be warned.

179
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,410
作为门卫
I will honor my sworn oath

180
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,580
我将遵守保护王国的誓言
to protect this realm as its Gatekeeper.

181
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,400
如果你们的归来威胁了阿斯加德的安全
If your return threatens the safety of Asgard,

182
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,080
彩虹桥将不会为你们开启
Bifrost will remain closed to you

183
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,560
你将被留在约顿海姆的寒冷荒漠中等死
and you'll be left to die in the cold waste of Jotunheim.

184
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,590
你不能干脆为我们一直开着桥吗
Couldn't you just leave the bridge open for us?

185
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,830
一直开启
To leave the bridge open

186
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,050
会释放彩虹桥的全部能量
would unleash the full power of the Bifrost

187
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,630
摧毁连你们在内的整个约顿海姆
and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it.

188
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,680
我可不准备今天死
I have no plans to die today.

189
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,800
没人想死
None do.

190
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,890
我们不该来的
We shouldn't be here.

191
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,140
走吧
Let's move.

192
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,770
他们在哪
Where are they?

193
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,080
躲起来了
Hiding,

194
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,250
懦夫的惯用伎俩
as cowards always do.

195
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,790
你们这么大老远来送死  阿斯加德人
You've come a long way to die, Asgardians.

196
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,890
我是托尔·奥丁森
I am Thor Odinson!

197
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,520
我们知道你是谁
We know who you are.

198
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,240
你们的人是怎么进入阿斯加德的
How did your people get into Asgard?

199
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,600
奥丁之家满是叛徒
The House of Odin is full of traitors.

200
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,650
不要用谎言污蔑我父王之名
Do not dishonor my father's name with your lies!

201
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,870
你父亲是个刽子手  是个小偷
Your father is a murderer and a thief!

202
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,440
你们又为什么而来  来讲和吗
And why have you come here? To make peace?

203
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,210
你期待战争  你渴望它
You long for battle. You crave it.

204
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,270
你不过是个
You're nothing but a boy

205
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,150
想证明自己是大人的小男孩
trying to prove himself a man.

206
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:19,260
本"男孩"厌倦了你的嘲笑
Well, this "boy" has grown tired of your mockery.

207
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,150
托尔  三思而后行
Thor, stop and think.

208
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,770
看看你周围  我们寡不敌众
Look around you, we're outnumbered.

209
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,460
记住你的位置  弟弟
Know your place, brother.

210
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,100
你不知道自己的行为将导致什么
You know not what your actions would unleash.

211
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,070
可我知道
I do.

212
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,990
走吧  趁我还没改主意
Go now, while I still allow it.

213
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,510
我们将接受您最宽仁的提议
We will accept your most gracious offer.

214
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,830
走吧  哥哥
Come on, brother.

215
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,030
滚回家吧  小公主
Run back home, little princess.

216
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,470
该死
Damn.

217
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,920
谁是下一个
Next?

218
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,590
至少给我点挑战嘛
At least make it a challenge for me!

219
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,720
这才像样
That's more like it.

220
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,860
别让他们碰到你
Don't let them touch you!

221
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,560
托尔
Thor!

222
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,340
-我们必须走了  -那就走吧
- We must go! - Then go!

223
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,140
快跑
Run!

224
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,060
托尔
Thor!

225
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,340
海姆达尔
Heimdall!

226
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,140
开启彩虹桥
Open the bridge!

227
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,870
父王  我们一起消灭他们
Father! We'll finish them together!

228
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,980
闭嘴
Silence!

229
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,580
众神之父
Allfather.

230
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,310
你看上去很疲惫
You look weary.

231
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,860
劳菲
Laufey,

232
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,670
就此打住吧
end this now.

233
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,360
是你儿子挑起的
Your boy sought this out.

234
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
没错
You're right.

235
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:48,370
这不过是男孩的胡闹  别小题大作
And these are the actions of a boy, treat them as such.

236
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,340
你我可以就此做个了结
You and I can end this here and now,

237
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,150
不要引发进一步的杀戮
before there's further bloodshed.

238
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:56,510
事情已经超出外交范围了  众神之父
We are beyond diplomacy now, Allfather.

239
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,400
他会得到他想要的
He'll get what he came for.

240
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,000
战争
War

241
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,570
还有死亡
and death.

242
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,450
那好吧
So be it.

243
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,640
为什么把我们带回来
Why did you bring us back?

244
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,080
你知道自己做了什么  挑起了什么吗
Do you realize what you've done? What you've started?

245
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,420
我在保卫我的家园
I was protecting my home.

246
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,190
你连自己的朋友都保护不了
You cannot even protect your friends!

247
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,910
又凭什么保护这个王国
How can you hope to protect a kingdom?

248
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,930
带他去疗伤  立刻
Get him to the healing room! Now!

249
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,740
如果惧怕行动  王国就要灭亡了
There won't be a kingdom to protect

250
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,240
还保卫什么
if you're afraid to act.

251
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,570
约顿巨人必须像曾经惧怕你一样学着惧怕我
The Jotuns must learn to fear me, just as they once feared you.

252
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,070
这是骄傲和自负  不是领导能力
That's pride and vanity talking, not leadership.

253
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,780
你忘了我教过你的一切
You've forgotten everything I taught you

254
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
战士的耐心
about a warrior's patience.

255
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,900
就在你等待和忍耐的时候
While you wait and be patient,

256
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,200
九大王国都在嘲笑我们
the Nine Realms laugh at us.

257
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,280
老路走不通了
The old ways are done.

258
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,210
你眼见阿斯加德衰落  却只会夸夸其谈
You'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls.

259
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,830
你是个虚荣  贪婪  残暴的孩子
You are a vain, greedy, cruel boy!

260
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,860
你是个愚蠢的老头
And you are an old man and a fool!

261
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,440
是啊
Yes.

262
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,860
我是愚蠢的
I was a fool

263
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,830
以为你已经准备好了
to think you were ready.

264
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,070
父王
Father...

265
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,660
托尔·奥丁森
Thor Odinson,

266
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,770
你违抗了国王的明确指令
you have betrayed the express command of your king.

267
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,460
由于你的傲慢和愚蠢
Through your arrogance and stupidity,

268
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,440
和平的王国和无辜的生灵
you've opened these peaceful realms and innocent lives

269
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:44,560
将面临战争的恐怖和惨景
to the horror and desolation of war!

270
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,380
你愧对这些王国
You are unworthy of these realms!

271
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,600
愧对你的头衔
You're unworthy of your title!

272
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,710
你愧对
You're unworthy

273
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:05,490
你所背叛的爱你之人
of the loved ones you have betrayed.

274
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,000
现在  我要收回你的能力
I now take from you your power!

275
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,170
以我父亲
In the name of my father

276
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,480
及祖父的名义
and his father before,

277
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,330
我  众神之父奥丁  将你驱逐
I, Odin Allfather, cast you out!

278
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,870
不管是谁持有此锤  只要他配得上
Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy,

279
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,990
就将拥有雷神之力
shall possess the power of Thor.

280
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,540
法律上讲  是你的错
I think that was legally your fault.

281
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,090
去拿急救箱
Get the first aid kit.

282
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,830
帮帮忙  千万别死
Do me a favor and don't be dead.

283
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,230
需要做心肺复苏吗
Does he need CPR?

284
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,040
我可会做心肺复苏了
Because I totally know CPR.

285
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,090
他从哪来的
Where did he come from?

286
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,020
你还好吗
You all right?

287
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,230
锤子
Hammer?

288
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,360
锤子
Hammer?

289
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,390
我们看得出你喝高了  挺明显的
Yeah, we can tell you're hammered. It's pretty obvious.

290
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,660
上帝啊  艾瑞克  看看这个
Oh, my God. Erik, look at this!

291
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,290
我们得在一切变化之前赶快行动
We have to move quickly before this all changes.

292
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,610
简  我们得送他去医院
Jane, we have to take him to the hospital.

293
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,920
-父王  -他好着呢  看看他
- Father! - He's fine, look at him.

294
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,120
海姆达尔
Heimdall!

295
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,010
我知道你能听见我  开启彩虹桥
I know you can hear me! Open the Bifrost!

296
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,000
医院  你去  我留下
Hospital. You go, I'll stay.

297
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,160
你  这是哪个王国
You. What realm is this?

298
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,280
艾尔夫海姆  诺恩海姆
Alfheim? Nornheim?

299
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,530
新墨西哥
New Mexico?

300
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:08,620
你胆敢用这么小的武器威胁我  托尔
You dare threaten me, Thor, with so puny a weapon?

301
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,940
咋了  他吓着我了
What? He was freaking me out!

302
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,590
下次你要电击一个人的话
Next time you decide to taser somebody,

303
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,920
确保他已经在车里了   好吗
make sure he's already in the car, okay?

304
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,250
简  走吧
Jane! Come on.

305
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:40,120
{\an8}县医院

306
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,100
姓名
Name?

307
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,950
他说他叫托尔
He said it was Thor?

308
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,570
托  尔
T-h-o-r.

309
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,350
你和他什么关系
And your relationship to him?

310
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,560
根本不认识
I've never met him before.

311
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,050
直到她开车撞倒了他
Until she hit him with a car.

312
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:55,250
只是擦到了他  但她把他电晕了
I grazed him, but she tasered him.

313
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,430
没错
Yes, I did.

314
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,980
只是抽点血
Just taking a little blood.

315
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,980
你胆敢袭击奥丁之子
How dare you attack the son of Odin?

316
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,200
快来帮忙
I need some help!

317
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,350
叫保安来
Call security!

318
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,880
保安速到三号急诊室  马上
Security to ER 3, stat!

319
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,250
你们打不过伟大的...
You're no match for the Mighty...

320
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,220
{\an8}旧桥市市界

321
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,450
你说这不是单纯的磁暴吧
You don't think this was just a magnetic storm, do you?

322
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,440
看  边缘处的透镜作用
Look, the lensing around these edges

323
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,220
是爱因斯坦-罗森桥的特征
is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

324
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,210
什么桥
A what?

325
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,290
-你不是科学专业的吗  -政治科学
- I thought you were a science major? - Political science.

326
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,980
她是唯一的申请人
She was the only applicant.

327
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,010
爱因斯坦-罗森桥是可能存在的
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge is a theoretical connection

328
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,340
两个不同时空的连接带
between two different points of space-time.

329
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,400
就是个虫洞
It's a wormhole.

330
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,880
-艾瑞克  你看到了什么  -星星
- Erik, look. What do you see? - Stars.

331
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,920
对  但不是我们的星星
Yeah, but not our stars.

332
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,700
看  这是我们这象限
See, this is the star alignment

333
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,560
每年这时候的星体排布
for our quadrant this time of year,

334
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,100
除非小熊星座休假了
and unless Ursa Minor decided to take a day off,

335
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,270
否则这就是别处的星座
these are someone else's constellations.

336
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,680
快看这个
Check this out.

337
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,410
不  不可能
No, it can't be.

338
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,670
我想我有东西落在医院了
I think I left something at the hospital.

339
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,160
这不可能
It's not possible!

340
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:48,020
{\an8}县医院

341
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:51,430
不知他是吸毒还是怎么的  突然就发飙
He was on drugs or something. He just went nuts.

342
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,780
天啊
Oh, my God.

343
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,810
我刚把一件最重要的证据弄丢了
I just lost my most important piece of evidence.

344
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,730
又这样
Typical.

345
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,920
-现在怎么办  -找到他
- So now what? - We find him.

346
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,610
你看到他在医院都干了什么吗
Did you see what he did in there?

347
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,370
去找他未必是个好主意
I'm not sure finding him is the best idea.

348
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,540
我们的数据无法说明
Well, our data can't tell us

349
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,880
处于磁暴之中是什么感觉
what it was like to be inside that event,

350
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,940
但他能  所以我们得找到他
and he can. So, we're gonna find him.

351
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,770
好吧
Okay.

352
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,820
看来得找遍整个新墨西哥了  对吧
So we're gonna look all over New Mexico, right?

353
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,410
没错
Exactly.

354
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,090
什么
What?

355
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,470
对不起  我发誓我不是故意老撞你的
I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not doing this on purpose.

356
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,820
我来  我来
I got it, I got it.

357
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,580
加油  搞定它
Come on, kick it in now!

358
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,690
拔起来了吗
Did it work?

359
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,520
长官  我们找到了
Sir, we found it.

360
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:48,060
作为一个疯子流浪汉  他太正点了
You know, for a crazy homeless person, he's pretty cut.

361
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,830
抱歉我电了你
Hey, sorry I tased you!

362
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,560
别动  别动
Excuse me, excuse me!

363
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,010
这是什么
What is this?

364
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,950
{\an8}你好  我的名字叫唐纳德·布莱克医生

365
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,230
我前男友的
My ex.

366
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,980
很会和病人相处  却不会跟我相处
Good with patients and bad with relationships.

367
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,550
只有这衣服合你身了
They're the only clothes I had that would fit you.

368
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,860
足矣
They will suffice.

369
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:20,820
不用客气
You're welcome.

370
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,980
这具人类躯体变弱了
This mortal form has grown weak.

371
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,540
我需要进食
I need sustenance.

372
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,480
我们不该让他去的
We should never have let him go.

373
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,160
没人能阻止他
There was no stopping him.

374
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,430
他只是被放逐了  又不是死了
Well, at least he's only banished, not dead.

375
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,430
要不是守护
Which is what we'd all be

376
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,950
把我们的去向告诉了奥丁  我们可就没命了
if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone.

377
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,250
守护是怎么知道的
How did the guard even know?

378
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,840
我告诉他的
I told him.

379
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,490
什么
What?

380
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,130
我叫他在我们走后把这事告诉奥丁
I told him to go to Odin after we'd left.

381
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,630
他动作太慢了  该挨顿鞭子
He should be flogged for taking so long.

382
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,990
我们本该在到约顿海姆前被拦下
We should never have reached Jotunheim.

383
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,220
是你告诉守护的
You told the guard?

384
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,520
我救了我们的命
I saved our lives.

385
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,510
还有托尔的
And Thor's.

386
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,130
我压根没想到父王会因此放逐他
I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.

387
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,950
洛基
Loki.

388
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,810
你得去找众神之父
You must go to the Allfather

389
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,600
劝他收回成命
and convince him to change his mind.

390
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,380
我去了又能如何
And if I do, then what?

391
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,350
我比你们都更爱托尔
I love Thor more dearly than any of you,

392
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,670
但你们知道他是怎样的人
but you know what he is.

393
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,250
高傲  鲁莽  极其危险
He's arrogant. He's reckless. He's dangerous.

394
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,080
你们看到他今天的所作所为了
You saw how he was today.

395
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,860
这是阿斯加德的国王该有的样子吗
Is that what Asgard needs from its king?

396
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,140
他嘴上说是为了阿斯加德好
He may speak of the good of Asgard,

397
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,570
但他一直嫉妒托尔
but he's always been jealous of Thor.

398
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,460
我们得感谢他
We should be grateful to him,

399
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,710
是他救了我们的命
he saved our lives.

400
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,200
劳菲曾说
Laufey said

401
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,680
奥丁之家里有叛徒
there were traitors in the House of Odin.

402
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,600
魔法大师有能力将三个约顿巨人带进阿斯加德
A master of magic could bring three Jotuns into Asgard.

403
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,890
洛基一向喜欢恶作剧
Loki's always been one for mischief,

404
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,260
但你说的可是相当严重的事
but you're talking about something else entirely.

405
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,130
放下
Stop!

406
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,280
我被诅咒了吗
Am I cursed?

407
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,860
没有
No.

408
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,360
我到底是什么人
What am I?

409
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,670
你是我儿子
You're my son.

410
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,840
此外呢
What more than that?

411
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,740
远古冬棺并不是
The Casket wasn't the

412
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,040
你那天从约顿海姆夺来的唯一东西吧
only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it?

413
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,430
没错
No.

414
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,690
战后
In the aftermath of the battle,

415
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:17,020
我走进神殿  发现了一个婴儿
I went into the temple and I found a baby.

416
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,250
巨人族的幼小后代
Small for a giant's offspring.

417
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:27,880
被遗弃  很痛苦  等着自生自灭
Abandoned, suffering, left to die.

418
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,810
是劳菲的儿子
Laufey's son.

419
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,220
劳菲的儿子
Laufey's son.

420
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,190
没错
Yes.

421
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,140
为什么
Why?

422
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,850
你杀约顿巨人无数  为何要带我走
You were knee-deep in Jotuns blood, why would you take me?

423
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,360
你只是无辜的孩子
You were an innocent child.

424
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,610
不  你带走我另有目的  是什么
No. You took me for a purpose. What was it?

425
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,950
告诉我
Tell me!

426
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,940
我希望有朝一日两族能联合
I thought we could unite our kingdoms one day.

427
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,350
形成同盟  带来永久和平
Bring about an alliance, bring about permanent peace.

428
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,470
通过你
Through you.

429
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,900
什么
What?

430
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,900
但那一切都无关紧要了
But those plans no longer matter.

431
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,120
这么说  我不过是又一件被盗纪念品
So I am no more than another stolen relic,

432
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,770
被困在此  等着某天派上用场
locked up here until you might have use of me.

433
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:20,960
你为什么要曲解我的意思
Why do you twist my words?

434
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,220
你本可从一开始就告诉我我的身份
You could have told me what I was from the beginning,

435
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,580
你为什么没说
why didn't you?

436
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,730
你是我儿子
You're my son.

437
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,020
我只是想保护你  不被真相伤害
I wanted only to protect you from the truth.

438
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,740
怎么
What?

439
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,550
因为我是孩子们睡前
Because I'm the monster

440
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,110
父母用来吓唬他们的怪兽吗
parents tell their children about at night?

441
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,100
-不是的  -现在一切都说得通了
- No, no. - You know, it all makes sense now!

442
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,830
为什么多年来你一直偏爱托尔
Why you favored Thor all these years!

443
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,340
因为无论你怎么说你爱我
Because no matter how much you claim to love me,

444
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,760
你绝不会让冰霜巨人
you could never have a Frost Giant

445
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,570
坐上阿斯加德的王座
sitting on the throne of Asgard!

446
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,830
卫兵
Guards!

447
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,620
卫兵  快点  帮帮我
Guards, please, help!

448
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,730
你是怎么到那片云里去的
How'd you get inside that cloud?

449
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,200
还有  你怎么能吃了一整盒糕点
Also, how could you eat an entire box of Pop-Tarts

450
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,870
还饿成这样
and still be this hungry?

451
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,060
这饮料  我喜欢
This drink, I like it.

452
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:29,930
是啊  很不错吧
I know. It's great, right?

453
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:30,910
再来
Another!

454
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,890
对不起  伊奇  小意外
Sorry, Lzzy. Little accident.

455
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,810
-你什么意思  -很美味  我还想来一杯
- What was that? - It was delicious. I want another.

456
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,910
-你可以直接说啊  -我说了啊
- Well, you could have just said so. - I just did.

457
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:44,000
不  好好说
No, I mean, ask nicely.

458
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,170
我没有失礼之意啊
I meant no disrespect.

459
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,090
好吧  别再砸东西了
All right. Well, no more smashing.

460
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,320
行吗
Deal?

461
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:51,960
我保证
You have my word.

462
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:54,130
很好
Good.

463
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,310
还要那些  伊奇
The usual, please, Lzzy.

464
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,450
你错过了陨石坑那边的精彩时刻
You missed all the excitement out at the crater.

465
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:03,420
他们说有个卫星掉在沙漠里了
They're saying some kind of satellite landed out in the desert.

466
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,180
我们本来玩得很开心
Yeah, we were having a good time with it

467
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,650
后来政府的人来了
until the Feds showed up.

468
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,120
打扰一下  你们是说有个卫星坠落了吗
Excuse me. Did you say there was a satellite crash?

469
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,040
是的
Yeah.

470
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:14,240
天啊  这个得传到脸书上  笑一个
Oh, my God. This is going on Facebook. Smile.

471
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,350
那卫星长什么样
What did it look like, the satellite?

472
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:22,510
不知道是不是卫星  只知道很重
I don't know anything about satellites, but it was heavy.

473
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,320
没人能拿得起它
I mean, nobody could lift it.

474
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:29,450
他们说它有辐射  我还碰过呢
They said it was radioactive. I had my hands all over it.

475
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,390
怎么走
Which way?

476
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,510
从这往西50英里
Fifty miles west of here.

477
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,860
劝你别去浪费时间
Well, I wouldn't waste my time!

478
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,950
我们走时似乎全军都出动了
Looked like the whole Army was coming when we left.

479
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:44,870
蠢蛋
Dumbass!

480
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,650
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

481
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,130
-西行50英里处  -为什么
- Fifty miles west of here. - Why?

482
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,610
去拿回属于我的东西
To get what belongs to me.

483
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:53,340
这么说那卫星成你的了
So you own a satellite now?

484
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,610
它不是他们说的那东西
It's not what they say it is.

485
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:55,330
不管它是什么
Well, whatever it is,

486
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:57,520
看来已经被政府控制了
the government seems to think it's theirs. So,

487
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,170
你就打算直冲过去抢回来吗
you just intend to go in there and take it?

488
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,050
是的
Yes.

489
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,940
如果你现在带我去那儿
If you take me there now,

490
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,890
我就告诉你  你想知道的一切
I'll tell you everything you wish to know.

491
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,220
-一切  -没错
- Everything? - Yes.

492
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,610
等我拿回雷神之锤  你就能得到
All the answers you seek will be yours

493
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,090
你寻求的答案
once I reclaim Mjolnir.

494
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:11,310
咩咩  咩咩是什么
Myeu-muh? What's Myeu-muh?

495
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,720
能跟你说句话吗  简
Can I have a word, Jane?

496
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,440
请别这么做
Please don't do this.

497
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,050
你昨晚不也看到了吗
You saw what I saw last night.

498
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:21,900
这不是巧合
This is no coincidence.

499
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,510
我们得查明陨石坑里有什么
We have to find out what's in that crater.

500
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,370
我不是在说陨石坑  我在说他
But I'm not talking about the crater, I'm talking about him.

501
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:28,190
-但他答应告诉我们真相  -他是疯子
- But he's promising us the answers. - He's delusional.

502
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,470
听听他都在说什么
Listen to what he's saying.

503
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,060
他说什么雷神之锤
He's talking about Mjolnir

504
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,810
托尔  彩虹桥
and Thor and Bifrost.

505
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,940
这是我从小听到大的神话
It's the stories I grew up with as a child.

506
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,940
我只是送他去  就这样
I'm just going to drive him. That's it.

507
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,910
他很危险  简
He's dangerous, Jane.

508
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:50,040
很抱歉  我不能送你去了
I'm sorry, but I can't take you.

509
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,570
那我们就此告别吧
Then this is where we say goodbye.

510
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,070
谢谢
Thank you?

511
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:05,490
简·福斯特
Jane Foster,

512
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,340

514
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,690
再会
farewell.

515
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:15,710
好吧
All right.

516
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:17,640
回去干活儿了
Back to work.

517
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,020
那是我的东西
That's my stuff!

518
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,410
这究竟是怎么回事
What the hell is going on here?

519
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,130
福斯特小姐  我是神盾局的科尔森特工
Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.

520
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,920
我应该知道那是什么意思吗
Is that supposed to mean something to me?

521
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:51,700
-你不能这样做  -简
- You can't do this! - Jane!

522
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,540
简  这比你想的严重多了  别管了
Jane, this is a lot more serious than you realize. Let it go.

523
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,020
别管  这可是我的生活
Let it go? This is my life.

524
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,110
我们在调查一项安全威胁
We're investigating a security threat.

525
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:00,080
我们得征用
We need to appropriate

526
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,830
你的记录  还有你的大气数据
your records and all your atmospheric data.

527
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:04,000
"征用"是偷的意思吗
By "appropriate," do you mean steal?

528
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,270
给  这足以弥补你的损失了
Here, this should more than compensate you for your trouble.

529
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:09,830
这些东西在睿侠可买不到
I can't just buy replacements at Radio Shack,

530
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:11,740
大部分设备都是我自己组装的
I made most of this equipment myself!

531
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,070
那你肯定能重做一次
Then I'm sure you can do it again.

532
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,500
我肯定也能告你侵犯我的宪法权利
And I'm sure I can sue you for violating my constitutional rights!

533
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,800
抱歉  福斯特小姐  但我们是好人
I'm sorry, Ms. Foster, but we're the good guys.

534
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,980
我们也是
So are we!

535
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:24,670
我就快弄清一件很了不起的事了
I'm on the verge of understanding something extraordinary.

536
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:26,270
而关于这现象  我所掌握的一切
And everything I know about this phenomenon

537
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:28,400
都在这实验室和这本子里了
is either in this lab or in this book.

538
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,270
你不能想拿就拿...
And you can't just take this away...

539
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,110
简  冷静  冷静  简...
Jane! Easy! Easy. Jane...

540
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:38,940
多谢配合
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,380
多年的研究

542

全没了
gone.

543
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,430
他们还拿走了我的iPod
They even took my iPod.

544
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:05,690
-备份资料呢  -也被拿了
- What about the backups? - They took our backups.

545
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,660
他们还拿走了备份资料的备份
They took the backups of our backups.

546
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,540
他们做得非常彻底
They were extremely thorough.

547
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,880
我刚下载了三十多首歌
I just downloaded, like, 30 songs onto there.

548
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,090
你能不能别提你的iPod了
Could you please stop with your iPod?

549
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,060
这些到底是什么人啊
Who are these people?

550
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:20,770
我认识个科学家
I knew this scientist.

551
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:23,490
是伽玛辐射领域的先驱
The pioneer in gamma radiation.

552
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:24,860
后来神盾局出现了
S.H.I.E.L.D. showed up

553
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:29,400
他就杳无音信了
and he wasn't heard from again.

554
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:31,880
他们不能这样对我们
They're not gonna do that to us.

555
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:33,350
我要去把东西抢回来
I'm gonna get everything back.

556
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,260
别这样  让我先联系下我的一个同事
Come on, please. Let me contact one of my colleagues.

557
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,120
他之前和这些人接触过
He's had some dealings with these people before.

558
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,460
我给他发邮件  也许他能帮上忙
I'll e-mail him and maybe he can help.

559
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,940
你的笔记本电脑也被拿走了
They took your laptop, too.

560
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,780
众神之父  我们有急事禀报
Allfather, we must speak with you urgently.

561
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:10,630
我的朋友们
My friends.

562
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,410
奥丁呢
Where's Odin?

563
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,560
父王进入奥丁之眠了
Father has fallen into the Odinsleep.

564
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,560
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}进入睡眠状态进行恢复和治愈

565

母后担心他将一觉不醒
Mother fears he may never awaken again.

566
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:21,680
我们要和她谈话
We would speak with her.

567
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,800
她不肯离开父王床边半步
She has refused to leave my father's bedside.

568
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:29,730
有急事你们可以直接对我说
You can bring your urgent matter to me.

569
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:38,560
我现在是你们的王
Your king.

570
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:54,490
王上  我们恳请您结束对托尔的放逐
My King, we would ask that you end Thor's banishment.

571
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:02,910
我的首个命令不能与父王的最后命令相悖
My first command cannot be to undo the Allfather's last.

572
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,640
我们就要与约顿海姆开战
We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim.

573
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,500
人民需要看到子承父命
Our people need a sense of continuity,

574
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,600
才能在困难时期拥有安全感
in order to feel safe in these difficult times.

575
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,730
所有人必须齐心合力
All of us must stand together

576
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:19,960
为阿斯加德而战
for the good of Asgard.

00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:23,820
是的  当然
Yes, of course.

578
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,220
很好  那你们等我下令吧
Good. Then you will wait for my word.

579
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,870
容我
If I may

580
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:33,680
恳请陛下再考虑下...
beg the indulgence of Your Majesty to perhaps reconsider...

581
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,680
够了
We're done!

582
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:18,620

我要匹马
I need a horse!

586
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,530
我们不卖马  只有狗猫鸟...
We don't have horses. Just dogs, cats, birds...

587
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,670
那随便给我头能骑的就好
Then give me one of those large enough to ride.

588
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,490
你还需要搭便车吗
Hey, you still need a lift?

589
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,530
我从未做过这样的事
I've never done anything like this before.

590
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:02,070
你做过这样的事吗
Have you ever done anything like this before?

591
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,740
经常
Many times.

592
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:06,510
不过你有这个胆量
But you're brave to do it.

593
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:08,980
他们偷走了我的毕生心血
Well, they just stole my entire life's work.

594
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,820
我已经别无可失了
I don't really have much left to lose.

595
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,900
但你很聪明
Yeah, but you're clever.

596
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,510
比这个王国的其他人聪明多了
Far more clever than anyone else in this realm.

597
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:20,220
"王国"  "王国"
"Realm"? "Realm"?

598
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,800
-你觉得我很奇怪  -是的
- You think me strange. - Yeah, I do.

599
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,280
怎么个奇怪法  是好还是坏
Good strange or bad strange?

600
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:27,970
目前我还不确定
I'm not quite sure yet.

601
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:34,590
对不起
I'm sorry.

602
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,320
但是  你是谁啊
But who are you?

603
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,590
说真的
Really?

604
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:49,100
你很快就会知道了
You'll see soon enough.

605
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,760
你答应告诉我答案的
You promised me answers.

606
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,150
你要找的是座桥
What you seek, it's a bridge.

607
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,970
爱因斯坦-罗森桥吗
Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

608
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,700
该说是彩虹桥
More like a Rainbow Bridge.

609
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,230
老天  但愿你没疯
God, I hope you're not crazy.

610
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:18,230
我真不习惯看到他这样
I never get used to seeing him like this.

611
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:22,860
他已推迟了太久  我担心...
He's put it off for so long now, that I fear...

612
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,920
这会持续多久
How long will it last?

613
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:30,480
不知道  这次不一样
I don't know. This time it's different.

614
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:32,140
我们毫无准备
We were unprepared.

615
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,450
他为什么要骗我
So why did he lie?

616
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:37,800
他对你保守秘密
He kept the truth from

617
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:40,440
是不希望你觉得自己是个异类
you so that you would never feel different.

618
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,150
你是我们的儿子  洛基
You are our son, Loki,

619
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,530
我们是你的家人
and we, your family.

620
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:49,140
我们不能放弃希望
We mustn't lose hope

621
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,630
要相信你父王一定会回到我们身边
that your father will return to us.

622
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:54,420
还有你哥哥
And your brother.

623
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,850
托尔还有什么希望
What hope is there for Thor?

624
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:01,710
你父王做任何事都有他的用意
There's always a purpose to everything your father does.

625
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,050
这根本不是卫星坠毁
That's no satellite crash!

626
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,040
否则  他们会拖走残骸
They would have hauled the wreckage away,

627
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,060
而不是在周围搭建设施
they wouldn't have built a city around it.

628
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,250
-你会需要这个的  -什么
- You're going to need this. - What?

629
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:43,930
等等  为什么
Wait, why?

630
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,300
待在原地
Now stay here.

631
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:50,040
等我拿回雷神之锤
Once I have Mjolnir,

632
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,220
就把那些被他们抢走的东西还给你
I will return the items they've stolen from you.

633
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:53,730
好吗
Deal?

634
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,390
不  看看下面的状况
No. Look what's down there.

635
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:58,050
你觉得你能闯进去把东西夺回来
You think you're just gonna walk in,

636
00:53:58,050 --> 00:53:59,410
再大摇大摆地走出来吗
grab our stuff and walk out?

637
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,260
不  我会飞回来
No. I'm going to fly out.

638
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,530
长官  侦察卫星的信号几乎无法穿透云层
Sir, feed from the keyhole can barely penetrate the cloud cover.

639
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:13,370
受这东西的干扰
Tech's barely working as it is,

640
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:15,790
设备本就很难正常运行
with all the interference that thing's giving off.

641
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,060
还有架商业飞机即将飞过上空
And we've got a commercial aircraft coming right over us.

642
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,980
西南航空5434航班
Southwest Airlines, flight 5434.

643
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,650
跟其他航班一样  更改航线
Reroute it like all the others.

644
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:25,710
稍等
Hold a sec.

645
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:28,200
西侧围栏外有东西
We've got something outside the fence, west side.

646
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:29,760
德兰西  我是杰克逊
Delancey, Jackson.

647
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,000
西侧围栏  去检查一下
West side perimeter. Go check it out.

648
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,550
到了
There it is.

649
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:46,200
德兰西  杰克逊  请回话
Delancey, Jackson. Report.

650
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,790
有人员受伤  围栏遭到破坏
Agent down. We've got a perimeter breach.

651
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,940
我是艾瑞克·塞尔维格博士  有事请留言
You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig. Please leave me a message.

652
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:17,420
艾瑞克  是我  别担心  我很好
Hi, Erik, it's me. Don't worry, I'm fine, but

653
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,310
但如果一小时内我没联系你
just in case you don't hear from me in the next hour,

654
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:23,400
就到陨石坑来找我  好吗
just come by the crater site and try and find me, okay?

655
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,250
我正在做你不让我做的事情  对不起
I did exactly what you told me not to. I'm sorry.

656
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:27,850
非常抱歉  再见
So sorry. Bye.

657
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:33,770
B区  行动
Bravo quadrant, move!

658
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,460
已进入南侧通道
Entering south tunnel!

659
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,870
不行  通讯中断
Negative, negative. I have no comms.

660
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,740
发现目标  东侧通道
Target sighted, east tunnel!

661
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,530
派一个人到高处  带上枪
I need eyes up high, with a gun.

662
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:36,240
朝北去了
Moving north!

663
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,270
怎么了
What have we got?

664
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:46,900
那玩意发出了
There's a massive electromagnetic surge

665
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,930
强电磁涌
coming off that thing.

666
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:49,520
系统几乎无法承受
Systems are barely coping.

667
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,190
巴顿  请回话
Barton? Talk to me.

668
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:54,960
要我击倒他吗  长官
You want me to slow him down, sir?

669
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,560
还是要派更多人去被他打趴
Or are you sending in more guys for him to beat up?

670
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,900
稍后给你指令
I'll let you know.

671
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:16,050
你块头还真大
You're big.

672
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:18,450
但我打过更大的
Fought bigger.

673
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:04,540
快下令  科尔森
Better call it, Coulson,

674
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,750
我开始喜欢这家伙了
'cause I'm starting to root for this guy.

675
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:28,700
最后的机会  长官
Last chance, sir.

676
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,950
等等  我想看看
Wait. I want to see this.

677
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:42,590
好了  表演结束  地面部队出动
All right, show's over. Ground units, move in.

678
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:37,490
他犯了罪  他进了监狱
He committed a crime. He's in jail!

679
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:40,000
-我不能把他丢在那儿  -为什么
- I can't just leave him there! - Why?

680
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,320
你没看到我看到的一切
You didn't see what I saw!

681
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,150
快看  快看  雷神之锤
Look! Look, it's Mjolnir.

682
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:50,240
你在哪找到的
Where'd you find this?

683
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:51,350
童书区
The children's section.

684
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:53,870
我想让你明白他的故事有多蠢
I just wanted to show you how silly his story was.

685
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:55,640
可你一直谆谆教导我
But you're the one who's always pushing me

686
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,410
要探索每一个可能  每一种解释
to chase down every possibility, every alternative!

687
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:00,600
我是让你探索科学  不是魔法
I'm talking about science, not magic!

688
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,060
魔法是我们还无法解释的科学
Well, magic's just science that we don't understand yet.

689
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:03,990
亚瑟·C·克拉克的名言
Arthur C. Clarke.

690
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,500
他是科幻小说作家
Who wrote science fiction.

691
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,450
-是科学真理的先驱  -个别时候而已
- A precursor to science fact! - In some cases, yeah.

692
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:10,070
如果确实存在爱因斯坦-罗森桥
Well, if there is an Einstein-Rosen Bridge,

693
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:11,510
那另一端一定有别的世界
then there's something on the other side.

694
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,660
更先进的生物可以穿过它
And advanced beings could have crossed it!

695
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:14,570
简
Jane.

696
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:16,080
原始的维京人
A primitive culture like the Vikings

697
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,610
可能将他们敬为了神灵
might have worshipped them as deities.

698
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:19,960
对  对  没错  谢谢你
Yes! Yes, exactly. Thank you.

699
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,380
你把我的人
You made my men,

700
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,850
一些全世界最训练有素的职业人员
some of the most highly trained professionals in the world,

701
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:34,180
比得像拿最低工资的超市保安
look like a bunch of minimum-wage mall cops.

702
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:36,770
这很伤人
That's hurtful.

703
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:39,150
根据我的经验
In my experience,

704
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:41,920
得是受过类似训练的人
it takes someone who's received similar training

705
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,390
才能像你那样打倒他们
to do what you did to them.

706
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:47,040
告诉我你是在哪里受的训练
Why don't you tell me where you received your training?

707
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,980
巴基斯坦  车臣  还是阿富汗
Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?

708
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,140
你看上去更像是雇佣兵
No, you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type.

709
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,800
哪里的  南非吗
Where was it? South Africa?

710
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:02,420
有些组织会花大价钱
Certain groups pay very well

711
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,210
雇佣你这么优秀的佣兵
for a good mercenary like you.

712
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:08,030
你到底是谁
Who are you?

713
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,070
无论如何
One way or another,

714
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:16,040
我们都会得到我们想要的信息
we find out what we need to know.

715
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,340
这我们很在行
We're good at that.

716
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:24,340
别乱跑
Don't go anywhere.

717
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:33,500
洛基  你怎么会来这里
Loki! What are you doing here?

718
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,070
我得来见见你
I had to see you.

719
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:37,970
发生了什么事
What's happened?

720
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,610
告诉我  是约顿海姆的事吗
Tell me. Is it Jotunheim?

721
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:42,420
让我去和父王解释
Let me explain to Father.

722
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,600
父王已经死了
Father is dead.

723
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:51,110
什么
What?

724
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,630
对你的驱逐
Your banishment,

725
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:57,610
战争再起的威胁
the threat of a new war,

726
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:01,400
让他难以承受
it was too much for him to bear.

727
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:05,100
你不要自责
You mustn't blame yourself.

728
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,470
我知道你爱他
I know that you loved him.

729
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:11,560
我也劝过他  但他听不进去
I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen.

730
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:16,270
明知你已无法拿起雷神之锤
It was so cruel to put the hammer within your reach,

731
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:18,360
还放在你眼前  实在残忍
knowing that you could never lift it.

732
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:24,380
现在王位的重担落在了我肩上
The burden of the throne has fallen to me now.

733
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,810
我能回家吗
Can I come home?

734
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:36,420
和约顿海姆的休战条件就是永远放逐你
The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.

735
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,180
好吧  但难道没有别的办法...
Yes, but couldn't we find a way...

736
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:42,410
母后也不允许你回家
And Mother has forbidden your return.

737
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,120
我是来告别的  哥哥
This is goodbye, Brother.

738
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,330
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

739
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:58,450
不
No.

740
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:01,490
该道歉的是我
I am sorry.

741
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:09,020
谢谢你来见我
Thank you for coming here.

742
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:15,000
永别了
Farewell.

743
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,370
再见
Goodbye.

744
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,390
再见
Goodbye?

745
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:33,440
我才刚回来
I just got back.

746
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:10,580
长官
Sir?

747
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:12,750
有人要见他
He's got a visitor.

748
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:20,080
他的名字是唐纳德·布莱克吗
His name is Donald Blake?

749
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,870
唐纳德·布莱克博士
Dr. Donald Blake.

750
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:24,170
你的同事还真危险  塞尔维格博士
You have dangerous coworkers, Dr. Selvig.

751
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,550
他得知你们拿走了
He was distraught when he found out

752
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,950
我们所有的研究资料后心急如焚
that you've taken all our research.

753
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:31,850
那是他一生的心血  就这样没了
That was years of his life, gone!

754
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,780
你该明白  人遇到那种事都会爆发
You can understand how a man could go off like that.

755
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:37,570
像你们这种庞大的秘密组织
A big, faceless organization like yours

756
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:40,440
带着一群穿长靴的暴徒闯进来...
coming in with their jackbooted thugs and...

757
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,450
他是这么说的
That's how he put it.

758
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,470
这也不足以解释
That still doesn't explain

759
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:46,660
他是如何突破我们的安保系统的
how he managed to tear through our security.

760
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:50,470
兴奋剂呗  他特别喜欢健身
Steroids! He's a bit of a fitness nut.

761
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:52,580
长官
Sir?

762
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:56,300
{\an8}伪造信息

763
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,070
系统显示他是个医学博士
It says here that he's an M.D.

764
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,340
他是  他以前是
Well, he is! Or he was.

765
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:04,330
他后来转行当了一名物理学家
He switched careers and became a physicist.

766
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:05,850
杰出的物理学家
A brilliant physicist.

767
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:08,660
他是个很棒的人  经历了很多磨难
He's a wonderful man. He's a man in pain.

768
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:13,360
唐尼  唐尼  唐尼
Donny, Donny, Donny!

769
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,500
你在这儿啊  你会没事的
There you are. You're gonna be all right.

770
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,130
我这就带你回家
I'm taking you home now.

771
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,850
塞尔维格博士
Dr. Selvig!

772
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:37,270
让他别再靠近围栏了
Just keep him away from the bars.

773
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:39,150
我会的
I will!

774
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,900
-我们去哪  -去喝一杯
- Where are we going? - To get a drink.

775
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,540
跟着他们
Follow them.

776
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,920
我全搞错了
You know, I had it all backwards.

777
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:57,780
全错了
I had it all wrong.

778
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:02,540
发现自己不知道
It's not a bad thing finding

779
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,580
所有的答案  并不是件坏事
out that you don't have all the answers.

780
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,630
你会开始问正确的问题
You start asking the right questions.

781
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:15,370
这是我人生中第一次
For the first time in my life,

782
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:20,040
不知道接下来该干什么
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

783
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:24,040
任何人想在这世上找到属于自己的道路
Anyone who's ever going to find his way in this world

784
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:27,110
都得先承认他不知自己究竟身在何处
has to start by admitting he doesn't know where the hell he is.

785
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,950
谢谢你的帮助
Thank you for what you've done.

786
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:33,900
不  不用谢我  我这么做是为了简
No, don't thank me. I only did it for Jane.

787
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:37,520
她爸爸和我曾在一所大学教书
Her father and I taught at university together.

788
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,210
他是个好男人
He was a good man.

789
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:42,000
听不进别人的话
He never listened.

790
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:44,110
我也是
Neither did I.

791
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:47,950
我父亲本想教育我
My father was trying to teach me something,

792
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:49,750
但我太迟钝了
but I was too stupid to see it.

793
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:52,430
我不知道你是有妄想症
I don't know if you're delusional

794
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:54,940
还是在耍什么花招
or if you're pulling some kind of con,

795
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:56,030
我不在乎
I don't care.

796
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:58,190
我只在乎她
I just care about her.

797
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,690
我看到她看你的眼神了
I've seen the way she looks at you.

798
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,800
我对你发誓  我无意伤害她
I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

799
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:08,710
很好
Good.

800
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,440
这样的话  我再请你喝一杯
In that case, I'll buy you another round,

801
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:13,630
然后你今晚就离开小镇
and you leave town tonight.

802
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:20,270
两杯酒鬼炸弹
Two boilermakers.

803
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:13,340
杀了他
Kill him.

804
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,360
都不顾我为你做了那么多吗
After all I've done for you?

805
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:24,400
原来是你指引我们进入阿斯加德的
So you're the one who showed us the way into Asgard.

806
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:26,470
说实话  那只是找点乐子
That was just a bit of fun, really.

807
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,110
为了毁掉我哥哥的大日子
To ruin my brother's big day.

808
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:32,920
保护我们的王国
And to protect the realm

809
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,940
能再晚些承受他愚蠢的统治
from his idiotic rule for a while longer.

810
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,030
我洗耳恭听
I will hear you.

811
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:47,810
我会掩护你和你几个手下
I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers,

812
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:49,920
带你们进入奥丁的房间
lead you into Odin's chambers,

813
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,870
你就可以杀了卧床的他
and you can slay him where he lies.

814
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,250
你为什么不自己杀了他
Why not kill him yourself?

815
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:59,690
我想阿斯加德人不会愿意接受
I suspect that the Asgardians would not take kindly

816
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:02,620
一个谋害先王的国王吧
to a king who had murdered his predecessor.

817
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,480
等奥丁死了
Once Odin is dead,

818
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,610
我就把远古冬棺还给你
I will return the Casket to you

819
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:10,920
你就可以让约顿海姆恢复...
and you can return Jotunheim to all its...

820
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,240
昔日光辉
glory.

821
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:18,300
我
I...

822
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,610
接受
accept.

823
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,160
你怎么了  门卫
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

824
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:31,690
你在约顿海姆时  我试图看你
I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim,

825
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:33,840
但却看不见也听不见
but could neither see you nor hear you.

826
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:36,160
你被遮蔽了
You were shrouded from me,

827
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:38,730
就像侵入这里的冰霜巨人那样
like the Frost Giants that entered this realm.

828
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,060
也许你是任职太久
Perhaps your senses have weakened

829
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:42,170
感官退化了吧
after your many years of service.

830
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:43,710
也可能是有人找到了办法
Or perhaps someone has found a way

831
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:46,880
隐藏不想被我看到的东西
to hide that which he does not wish me to see.

832
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:50,880
你有强大的力量  海姆达尔
You have great power, Heimdall.

833
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:54,770
奥丁曾畏惧过你吗
Did Odin ever fear you?

834
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:58,340
-没有  -为什么
- No. - And why is that?

835
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:01,980
因为他是我的国王  我誓死服从他
Because he is my king and I am sworn to obey him.

836
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:05,790
他曾经是你的国王  现在你要服从我了
He was your king and you're sworn to obey me now.

837
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:08,040
对吗
Yes?

838
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:14,340
是的
Yes.

839
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,750
那就不准为任何人开启彩虹桥
Then you will open the Bifrost to no one

840
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:21,400
直到我收拾好我哥留下的烂摊子
until I have repaired the damage that my brother has done.

841
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,070
天哪  他还好吗
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

842
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:40,170
他很好  毫发无伤
He's fine. Not injured at all.

843
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:42,730
真抱歉  我的朋友
I'm sorry, my friend.

844
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:44,640
-怎么回事  -我们喝酒了  打了一架
- What happened? - We drank, we fought,

845
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,460
他给家族争光了
he made his ancestors proud.

846
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:47,970
把他放到床上去
Put him on the bed.

847
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:03,150
我还是不相信你是雷神
I still don't think you're the God of Thunder.

848
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,060
但你应该是
But you ought to be.

849
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:19,070
这是你的住所吗
Are these your chambers?

850
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:22,630
说是临时住所更合适
It's more of a temporary living situation.

851
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:27,720
抱歉  一般没客人会来
I'm sorry. I don't usually have guests.

852
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:31,180
事实上  从没来过客人
Actually, I never have guests.

853
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,110
放错地方了
That's not the right place for it.

854
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:37,880
抱歉
I'm sorry.

855
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,380
我们出去吧
Can we go outside?

856
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,720
好啊  当然
Yes, of course.

857
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:52,090
我睡不着时就会来这里
I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep

858
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:54,350
或是整理粒子数据的时候
or I'm trying to reconcile particle data,

859
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:56,680
又或是达西快把我逼疯的时候
or when Darcy's driving me crazy.

860
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:00,890
仔细想想  我其实经常来这里
I come up here a lot, actually, now that I think about it.

861
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,710
真高兴你没事
I'm really glad you're safe.

862
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:10,320
你对我很好
You've been very kind to me,

863
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:13,610
而相比之下  我的表现太不知感恩了
and I've been far less grateful than you deserve.

864
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:15,180
我开车撞了你几次
Well, I hit you with my car a couple times,

865
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:17,260
我们算是扯平了
so I think that kind of evens things out.

866
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,590
也许是我活该被撞
Perhaps I had it coming.

867
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:28,630
天哪
Oh, my God!

868
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,530
难以置信
I don't believe it!

869
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:33,400
我只能拿回这些
It was all I could get back.

870
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:35,160
很抱歉没能兑现我的承诺
I'm sorry it's not as much as I promised.

871
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,630
不  这很棒了  这...
No, no, this is great! This is...

872
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:39,800
我不用再从头开始了
I don't have to start from scratch now.

873
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:41,260
谢谢你
Thank you.

874
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,550
怎么了
What's wrong?

875
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,070
神盾局  不管他们是什么组织
S.H.I.E.L.D. Whatever they are,

876
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,460
都会尽一切办法
they're gonna do everything in their power

877
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:57,190
使我们的研究无法得见天日
to make sure this research never sees the light of day.

878
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:58,580
不  简
No, Jane.

879
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:01,820
听我说  你不能放弃
Listen to me. You must not give up.

880
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,930
-要有始有终  -为什么
- You must finish what you've started. - Why?

881
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:05,160
因为你是正确的
Because you're right.

882
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:07,150
来  你看
Here, look.

883
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:12,250
你们的祖先称之为魔法
Your ancestors called it magic,

884
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,720
你称之为科学
and you call it science.

885
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:14,990
在我的家乡
Well, I come from a place

886
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:16,770
它们两者是同样的东西
where they're one and the same thing.

887
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:32,570
这是什么
What is that?

888
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:37,050
我父王是这样对我解释的
My father explained it to me like this,

889
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,790
你们的世界
that your world

890
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:41,810
是宇宙九大王国之一
is one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos,

891
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:45,210
连接各王国的是世界树的枝干
linked to each other by the branches of Yggdrasil,

892
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:46,750
也就是世界之树
the Worlds Tree.

893
01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:50,350
你们每天都看到它  但不自知
Now you see it every day without realizing.

894
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:52,070
这些拍到图像  用...
The images glimpsed through...

895
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,250
你们叫它什么来着
What did you call it?

896

再说点吧
Tell me more.

899
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,680
九大王国
So, the Nine Realms.

900
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,810
这里是米德加德  也就是地球
Now, there is Midgard, which is Earth.

901
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:10,500
这里是艾尔夫海姆
This is Alfheim.

902
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:12,280
这是华纳海姆

这是约顿海姆
Jotunheim.

904
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:15,850
这是阿斯加德
And Asgard.

905
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,110
这就是我的家
And that's where I come from.

906
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,920
谢谢你  简

907
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:43,330
我们的挚友被驱逐了  洛基登上了王位
Our dearest friend banished, Loki on the throne,

908
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:46,870
阿斯加德面临战祸  而你却在这儿大吃大喝
Asgard on the brink of war, yet you've managed to consume

909
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:50,180
四只野猪  六只雉鸡  半只牛
four wild boar, six pheasant, a side of beef,

910
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:52,740
还有两大桶麦酒  我都替你脸红
and two casks of ale. Shame on you.

911
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:54,020
你就什么都不在乎吗
Don't you care?

912
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:56,780
别把我的胃口理解成冷漠
Do not mistake my appetite for apathy!

913
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:58,370
你们两个  够了
Stop it, both of you!

914
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:00,160
别闹了
Stop.

915
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,990
-我们都清楚该做什么  -我们得行动
- We all know what we have to do. - We must go.

916
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,360
我们得找到托尔
We must find Thor.

917
01:16:09,950 --> 01:16:11,190
那是叛国罪
It's treason.

918
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:13,030
去他的叛国  那是自杀
To hell with treason, it's suicide.

919
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:15,300
托尔也会为我们铤而走险的
Thor would do the same for us.

920
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:17,490
别说了
Now shush.

921
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:21,180
海姆达尔可能在监视我们呢
Heimdall might be watching.

922

海姆达尔要见你们
Heimdall demands your presence.

923
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,660
我们死定了
We're doomed.

924

你们想违抗我们的国王洛基的命令
You would defy the commands of Loki, our king,

925
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,720
打破作为战士曾许下的誓言
break every oath you have taken as warriors,

926
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,480
犯下叛国罪把托尔带回来吗

927

我不能为你们开启彩虹桥
I cannot open the bridge to you.

931
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:55,110
这家伙真难懂  是吧
Complicated fellow, isn't he?

932
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:56,430
现在我们怎么办
Now what do we do?

933
01:16:58,050 --> 01:16:59,040
你们看
Look!

934
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:19,980
-刚刚那是什么鬼  -我不知道  长官

935
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:21,600
刚才突然探测到了超强的能量
We got massive energy readings out of nowhere

936
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,810
然后又突然消失

943
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:16,800

这是很棒的理论  简
It's a beautiful theory, Jane.

951
01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:57,050
但你别想
But you won't be able to

952
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:59,720
说服科学界相信
convince the scientific community of any of it.

953
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,210
除非你有证据
Not without hard evidence.

954
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:03,700
找到你了
Found you!

955
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:10,910
我的朋友们
My friends!

956
01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:15,240
太好了  太好了
This is good! This is good.

957
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,380
难以置信
I don't believe it.

958
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:19,710
容我介绍一下  希芙女士和三位勇士
Excuse me. Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.

959

01:19:33,130 --> 01:19:35,090
你们知道我不能回去
You know I can't go home.

964
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:38,240
我的父王
My father is

965
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:41,080
因我而死

我必须继续被流放

967
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:44,940
托尔
Thor,

968
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,360
你父王还活着

969
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:03,360
告诉我  洛基
Tell me, Loki,

970
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,880
你怎么把约顿巨人带进阿斯加德的
how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard?

971
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,600
你以为彩虹桥是进出王国的
You think the Bifrost is the only way

972
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,180
唯一途径吗
in and out of this realm?

973
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:10,650
各个王国间有很多密道
There are secret paths between the worlds

974
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:13,570
哪怕你天赋异禀也看不到
to which even you, with all your gifts, are blind.

975
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:16,940
但我已经不再需要它们了  我是国王了

我宣布  因为你的叛国行为

免除你门卫的职务
you are relieved of your duties as Gatekeeper,

978
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,720
你不再是阿斯加德的公民了

979
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:26,190
那我就不用听命于你了
Then I need no longer obey you.

980
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:49,120
找语言学部的人来看看
Get somebody from Linguistics down here.

981
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:18,940

01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:24,400
是斯塔克的吗
Is that one of Stark's?

983
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:27,960
不知道  他什么都不跟我说
I don't know. The guy never tells me anything.

984
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:32,820

990
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:57,950
-你呢  -我要留在这儿
- What are you gonna do? - I'm staying here.

991
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,470
托尔要和我们并肩作战
Thor's going to fight with us!

992
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:01,110
我的朋友们
My friends,

993
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,280
我现在肉体凡胎  我只会碍手碍脚
I'm just a man. I'll only be in the way,

994
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,000
甚至连累你们
or worse, get one of you killed.

995
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,120
但我能帮他们转移去安全的地方
But I can help get these people to safety.

996
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:10,350
如果你要留下  我也留下
Well, if you're staying, then so am I.

997
01:22:10,810 --> 01:22:12,920
-我们需要点时间  -我们帮你争取时间
- We'll need some time. - You'll have it!

998
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,070
好吧  大家快走吧
Okay, move it, people!

999
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,020
大家都出去  从后门走
Everybody out! Use the back door.

1000
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:20,150
快走  回头再吃
Go, hurry! You can eat later.

1001
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:33,990
分散他的注意力
Keep it distracted.

1002
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:52,180
为了阿斯加德

1003

撤退
Fall back!

1004

Go. Now. Run!

1005
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:16,800
希芙  希芙  你已经尽力了
Sif. Sif, you've done all you can.

1006
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:19,250
不  死也要死得像个战士
No. I will die a warrior's death.

1007
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:21,070
历史会记住这一刻的
Stories will be told of this day.

1008
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:24,280
活下去  自己讲述这段历史
Live, and tell those stories yourself.

1009
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:27,950
快跑
Now go.

1010
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:39,220
你们得回阿斯加德  去阻止洛基
You must return to Asgard. You have to stop Loki.

1011
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:40,330
那你怎么办
What about you?

1012
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,860
别担心  朋友们  我自有打算

弟弟  不管我怎样委屈了你
Brother, whatever I have done to wrong you,

1019
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,150
不管我做了什么让你这样

1020
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:46,880
我真的很抱歉
I am truly sorry.

1021
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:49,530
但这些人是无辜的
But these people are innocent.

1022
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:54,180
杀了他们对你没有任何好处
Taking their lives will gain you nothing.

1023
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,150
杀了我吧
So take mine

1024
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:05,330
然后到此为止
and end this.

1025

1026
01:26:36,610 --> 01:26:37,840
结束了
It's over.

1027
01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:40,410
不  没结束
No. It's not over.

1028
01:26:41,110 --> 01:26:43,370
我是说  你安全了
I mean, you're safe.

1029
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,380
我们都很安全
We're safe.

1030
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,750
那就行了
It's over.

1031

1032
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:41,910
-出现峰值  -读数上升

只要他配得上
if he be worthy,

1035
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:52,630
就将拥有雷神之力
shall possess the power of Thor.

1036
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:09,200
简

1037
01:28:11,790 --> 01:28:12,620

-快走  -不
- Come! - No.

1040
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:39,070
天啊
Oh. My. God.

1041
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:50,590
这才是你平时的装束吗
So, is this how you normally look?

1042
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:52,190
差不多吧
More or less.

1043
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,510
挺帅的
It's a good look.

1044
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:56,890
我们得去彩虹桥的落点
We must go to the Bifrost site.

1045

我有话和我弟弟说
I would have words with my brother.

1046
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,400
打扰一下
Excuse me!

1047
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:04,220
唐纳德
Donald?

1048
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:07,080
我认为你没对我说实话
I don't think you've been completely honest with me.

1049
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:08,670
听着  科尔之子
Know this, Son of Coul.

1050
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:08,670
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}之前讲的起名习惯
托尔以为科尔森的名字也是这个意思

1051
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:10,330
你和我  我们都是在为
You and I, we fight for the same cause,

1052
01:30:10,330 --> 01:30:11,690
保护这个世界而战
the protection of this world.

1053
01:30:11,690 --> 01:30:13,910
从今天起  我与你结盟
From this day forward, you can count me as your ally

1054
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:16,900
但你得把你拿走的简的东西还回来
if you return the items you have taken from Jane.

1055
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:18,330
-偷走的  -借用而已
- Stolen. - Borrowed.

1056
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:21,450
好吧  你可以拿回你的设备
Of course, you can have your equipment back.

1057
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:23,560
这样你才能继续你的研究
You're gonna need it to continue your research.

1058
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,380
你想看我跟你说过的那座桥吗
Would you like to see the bridge we spoke of?

1059
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:29,030
当然
Sure.

1060
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:32,800
等等  我还有事要问你
Wait, I need to debrief you!

1061
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:41,760
欢迎来到阿斯加德
Welcome to Asgard.

1062
01:31:07,150 --> 01:31:09,110
海姆达尔  开启彩虹桥
Heimdall, open the Bifrost.

1063
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:18,150
海姆达尔
Heimdall?

1064
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,410
海姆达尔
Heimdall!

1065
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:26,950
他不回应
He doesn't answer.

1066
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:29,570
那我们就被困在这了
Then we are stranded.

1067
01:31:29,570 --> 01:31:32,930
海姆达尔  你能听见吗  我们需要你
Heimdall! If you can hear me, we need you now!

1068
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,940
海姆达尔  我们需要你
Heimdall! We need you now!

1069
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:43,980
海姆达尔
Heimdall!

1070
01:31:58,450 --> 01:32:01,390
我必须回阿斯加德去  但我向你保证
I must go back to Asgard, but I give you my word,

1071
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:04,970
我会回来找你的
I will return for you.

1072
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:13,670
好吗
Deal?

1073
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:28,590
好的
Deal.

1074
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:46,880
带他去疗伤
Get him to the healing room!

1075
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:50,230
我去找我弟弟
Leave my brother to me.

1076
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:16,500
据说
It's said

1077
01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:22,150
你依然能看见  听见周遭发生的事情
you can still hear and see what transpires around you.

1078
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:24,990
希望这是真的
I hope it's true,

1079
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:28,890
那样你就会知道
so that you may know

1080
01:33:29,970 --> 01:33:33,900
你是死在
your death came at the hand

1081
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:36,760
劳菲手里
of Laufey.

1082
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:48,080
而你是死在奥丁之子手里
And your death came by the son of Odin.

1083
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:54,880
洛基
Loki!

1084
01:33:55,370 --> 01:33:56,810
你救了你父王
You saved him!

1085
01:34:01,450 --> 01:34:03,070
我向你发誓  母后
I swear to you, Mother,

1086
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:06,180
他们会为今天的所作所为付出代价
that they will pay for what they've done today.

1087
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:07,450
洛基
Loki.

1088
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:09,230
托尔
Thor!

1089
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:11,990
我就知道你会回来的
I knew you'd return to us.

1090
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:19,410
你为什么不告诉她
Why don't you tell her

1091
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:23,260
你是怎么派毁灭者去杀我和我们的朋友
how you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends, to kill me?

1092
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:24,140
什么
What?

1093
01:34:24,270 --> 01:34:26,990
它一定是执行了父王最后的命令
Why, it must have been enforcing Father's last command.

1094
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:30,060
你是个厉害的骗子  一直都是
You're a talented liar, Brother. Always have been.

1095
01:34:30,390 --> 01:34:31,740
你回来了真好
It's good to have you back.

1096
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:35,310
失陪了  我得去摧毁约顿海姆
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to destroy Jotunheim.

1097
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:18,700
你阻止不了的
You can't stop it.

1098
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:22,250
彩虹桥会一直开启到约顿海姆被撕碎
The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart.

1099
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:44,780
简
Jane?

1100
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,650
你为什么这么做
Why have you done this?

1101
01:35:48,730 --> 01:35:51,880
证明给父王看  我才是他的好儿子
To prove to Father that I am the worthy son.

1102
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:55,200
等他醒来时  是我救了他命
When he wakes, I will have saved his life.

1103
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:58,250
还杀死了那一族的怪物
I will have destroyed that race of monsters.

1104
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:00,800
我会成为王位的真正继承人
And I will be true heir to the throne!

1105
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:02,850
你不能消灭一整个种族
You can't kill an entire race!

1106
01:36:02,850 --> 01:36:03,840
为什么不能
Why not?

1107
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:10,440
你怎么对冰霜巨人突然产生好感了
And what is this newfound love for the Frost Giants?

1108
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:14,710
你以前可是会赤手空拳把他们杀光
You could have killed them all with your bare hands.

1109
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:16,770
-我变了  -我也是
- I've changed. - So have I.

1110
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:19,640
来打我啊
Now fight me.

1111
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:24,760
我从来没想要王位
I never wanted the throne!

1112
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:28,580
我只想得到和你一样的对待
I only ever wanted to be your equal.

1113
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,820
我不会和你打的  弟弟
I will not fight you, Brother!

1114
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:32,060
我不是你弟弟
I'm not your brother.

1115
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,460
从来都不是
I never was.

1116
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:36,160
洛基  这简直疯了
Loki, this is madness.

1117
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:37,610
是吗
Is it madness?

1118
01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:40,100
疯狂吗
Is it?

1119
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:42,700
疯狂吗
Is it?

1120
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:45,550
拜托  你在地球上遭遇了什么
Come on. What happened to you on Earth

1121
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,760
把你变得这么懦弱
that turned you so soft?

1122
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:50,160
别跟我说是因为那个女人
Don't tell me it was that woman.

1123
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:54,480
还真是
It was!

1124
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:57,210
也许  等我们结束了这一切
Well, maybe, when we're finished here,

1125
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:59,580
我会亲自去看看她
I'll pay her a visit myself!

1126
01:37:41,210 --> 01:37:42,170
托尔
Thor!

1127
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:51,260
哥哥  救我
Brother, please.

1128
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:03,880
够了
Enough!

1129
01:38:48,050 --> 01:38:49,130
看看你
Look at you,

1130
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:53,070
强大的托尔
the Mighty Thor,

1131
01:38:56,150 --> 01:38:58,020
力大无穷
with all your strength,

1132
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:01,140
现在对你又有何用
and what good does it do you now?

1133
01:39:03,030 --> 01:39:06,570
你听到了吗  哥哥  你什么都做不了
Do you hear me, Brother? There's nothing you can do!

1134
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:26,150
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1135
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,990
如果你毁了彩虹桥  你就再也见不到她了
If you destroy the bridge, you'll never see her again!

1136
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:42,080
原谅我  简
Forgive me, Jane.

1137
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:22,520
我本可以做到的  父王
I could have done it, Father!

1138
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:25,370
我本可以做到的
I could have done it!

1139
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:27,390
为了你
For you!

1140
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:29,610
为了大家
For all of us!

1141
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:32,920
不  洛基
No, Loki.

1142
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:43,250
洛基  不要
Loki, no.

1143
01:40:44,210 --> 01:40:46,220
不
No!

1144
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:51,740
不
No.

1145
01:41:08,150 --> 01:41:09,170
结束了
It's gone.

1146
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:24,950
然后  我一声大吼
And then, with a mighty bellow,

1147
01:42:25,130 --> 01:42:29,880
飞进了铁巨人的体内  把他放倒了
I flew into the giant metal creature and laid him low!

1148
01:42:30,020 --> 01:42:32,930
那是摔了个四脚朝天的意思吗
Is that another way of saying you fell on your huge ass?

1149
01:42:32,930 --> 01:42:34,320
事实上
As a matter of fact,

1150
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:39,310
摔倒只是蒙蔽毁灭者的策略
falling was a tactic lulling the Destroyer...

1151
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:55,780
王后陛下  您儿子的事我很遗憾
My Queen, I'm so sorry for your loss.

1152
01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:02,950
他怎么样了
How is he?

1153
01:43:05,550 --> 01:43:07,220
他在悼念他的弟弟
He mourns for his brother.

1154
01:43:08,970 --> 01:43:09,950
还有...
And...

1155
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:12,510
他思念她
He misses her.

1156
01:43:13,870 --> 01:43:14,850
那个凡人
The mortal.

1157
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:33,160
你将会是个明君
You'll be a wise king.

1158
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:40,100
不会再有比你更贤明的君主
There will never be a wiser king than you.

1159
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:42,820
和更完美的父亲了
Or a better father.

1160
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:57,460
我有很多要学的
I have much to learn.

1161
01:43:59,380 --> 01:44:00,410
我现在知道了
I know that now.

1162
01:44:05,970 --> 01:44:07,480
也许有一天
Someday, perhaps,

1163
01:44:09,270 --> 01:44:10,760
我会让你以我为傲
I shall make you proud.

1164
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:20,230
你已经让我骄傲了
You've already made me proud.

1165
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:37,060
我们再也到不了地球了
So Earth is lost to us.

1166
01:44:38,630 --> 01:44:39,540
不
No.

1167
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,260
希望总是有的
There is always hope.

1168
01:44:46,710 --> 01:44:47,850
你能看到她吗
Can you see her?

1169
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:52,160
能
Yes.

1170
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:58,030
我拿了粒子探测仪
I have the particle detectors!

1171
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:00,390
达西  你拿神盾局的卫星密码了吗
Darcy, do you have the S.H.I.E.L.D. satellite codes?

1172
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,560
嗯  你看见我的电击枪了吗
Yeah. Have you seen my Taser?

1173
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:03,610
她还好吗
How is she?

1174
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:06,300
上车  走吧  简
In the car. Come on, Jane!

1175
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,410
她在找你
She searches for you.

1176
01:46:54,300 --> 01:47:00,100
{\an5}雷    神

1177
01:53:18,050 --> 01:53:19,600
塞尔维格博士
Dr. Selvig.

1178
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:24,710
你就是那个幕后主脑吗
So you're the man behind all this?

1179
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:28,770
这里像个迷宫
It's quite a labyrinth.

1180
01:53:29,990 --> 01:53:33,800
我还以为他们要带我来杀了我
I was thinking they're taking me down here to kill me.

1181
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:43,970
我听说了新墨西哥州的事
I've been hearing about the New Mexico situation.

1182
01:53:44,990 --> 01:53:46,860
你的工作让很多比我聪明的人
Your work has impressed a lot of people

1183
01:53:46,860 --> 01:53:48,650
非常倾佩
who are much smarter than I am.

1184
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:50,460
我手里的资料多
I have a lot to work with.

1185
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:54,740
福斯特的理论  通往另一个世界的通道
The Foster Theory. A gateway to another dimension.

1186
01:53:55,210 --> 01:53:56,460
这是前所未有的
It's unprecedented.

1187
01:53:58,980 --> 01:53:59,900
不是吗
Isn't it?

1188
01:54:03,510 --> 01:54:06,820
传说和历史之间总是有区别
Legend tells us one thing, history, another.

1189
01:54:07,210 --> 01:54:08,180
但也有时候
But every now and then,

1190
01:54:08,190 --> 01:54:11,140
两者会发生重叠
we find something that belongs to both.

1191
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:20,430
这是什么
What is it?

1192
01:54:20,430 --> 01:54:21,700
力量  博士
Power, Doctor.

1193
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:23,920
如果我们能弄清怎么利用它
If we can figure out how to tap it,

1194
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:26,370
也许就能拥有无尽的力量
maybe unlimited power.

1195
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:33,910
我想这值得一试
Well, I guess that's worth a look.

1196
01:54:35,740 --> 01:54:37,760
我想这值得一试
Well, I guess that's worth a look.

42
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,660
我就将恢复全部力量
I shall be restored to my full might.

43
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,980

I will tower over the mountains,

and bury my sword deep in Asgard's...

45
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,010
等等  等一下
Hang on. Give it a second.

46
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,380
我发誓  我根本没动  是它自己在转
I swear, I'm not even moving. It's just doing this on its own.

47
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,170
真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

48
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,630
好了  是这么回事吗
Okay, so let me get this straight.

49
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,980
你要把你的王冠放进永恒烈火里
You're going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame

50
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,410
然后你会突然变得有房子那么大
and then you'll suddenly grow as big as a house?

51
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,470
是山
A mountain!

52
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,930
永恒烈火是奥丁锁在阿斯加德的那个
The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard?

53
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,770
奥丁不在阿斯加德
Odin is not on Asgard.

54
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,420
而你的离开让王权失去了防卫
And your absence has left the throne defenseless.

55
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,780
好吧  那王冠在哪呢
Okay, so where is it? This crown?

56
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,210
这就是我的王冠  我力量的源泉
This is my crown, the source of my power.

57
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,660
那是王冠啊  我以为你是眉毛长得比较夸张
Oh, that's a crown. I thought it was a big eyebrow.

58
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,810
是王冠
It's a crown.

59
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,440
总之  听上去  我想阻止诸神黄昏
Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok

60
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,490
只需要扯下你脑袋上那玩意
is rip that thing off your head.

61
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,290
但诸神黄昏已经开始了
But Ragnarok has already begun.

62
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,790
你无法阻止
You cannot stop it.

63
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,140
我是阿斯加德的末日  你也是
I am Asgard's doom, and so are you.

64
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,180
一切都将遭受煎熬  被烈火吞噬
All will suffer, all will burn.

65
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,430
好紧张
That's intense.

66
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,940
老实说  看着你变得老大
To be honest, seeing you grow really big

67
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,710
然后烧掉一颗星球  肯定很壮观
and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle.

68
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,500
但看来我只能选择第二条路
But it looks like I'm gonna have to choose option B,

69
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,190
那就是我挣脱这铁链
where I bust out of these chains,

70
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,000
把你的头饰从脑袋上砸下来
knock that tiara off your head,

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,270
然后藏在阿斯加德的地堡里
and stash it away in Asgard's vault.

72
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,430
你无法阻止诸神黄昏
You cannot stop Ragnarok.

73
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,800
何必抵抗呢
Why fight it?

74
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,570
因为  英雄都会这么做
Because that's what heroes do.

75
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,590
等等  抱歉  我时机掐得不太好
Wait, I'm sorry. I didn't time that right.

76
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,060
来了
And, now!

77
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,440
{\an9}BGM: Immigrant Song  By  Led Zeppelin

78
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,080
你犯了个大错误  奥丁森
You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.

79
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,690
我经常犯大错误
I make grave mistakes all the time.

80
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,190
看来结果还不错嘛
Everything seems to work out.

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,560
海姆达尔  我知道我们好久没联系了
Heimdall, I know it's been a while,

82
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,320
但我真的很需要赶紧离开这里
but I could really use a fast exit.

83
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,050
海姆达尔
Heimdall?

84
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,460
海姆达尔就是个蠢货
Heimdall was an idiot.

85
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,630
这份工作本该让他发财的
This job should have made him rich.

86
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,030
这份工作并不轻松
Now, the job ain't easy

87
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,300
但还是有些好处的
but it does have its benefits.

88
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,870
彩虹桥让我可以接触到
The Bifrost gives me access

89
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,550
九大王国的一切
to everything the Nine Realms has to offer.

90
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,970
我想拿就拿
I mean, it's all mine for the taking.

91
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,670
看啊
Behold...

92
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,080
我的东西
My stuff.

93
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,900
我特别喜欢这俩玩意
I'm particularly fond of these.

94
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,640
我从米德加德一个叫德克萨斯的地方拿到了它们
I pulled them out of a place on Midgard called Texas.

95
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,230
我还给它们起了名字  毁天和灭地
I even named them. Des and Troy.

96
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,130
因为  当它们合在一起
You see, when you put them together,

97
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,460
就能毁天灭地
they destroy.

98
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,300
海姆达尔  拜托了
Heimdall, come on.

99
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,190
别动
Stay!

100
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,260
海姆达尔  我要没招了
Heimdall? I'm running short on options.

101
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,770
海姆达尔
Heimdall?

102
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,730
斯科尔奇
Skurge?

103
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,270
那个要紧吗
Is that important?

104
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,290
你们俩姑娘今天有好戏看了
You girls are in for a treat.

105
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:38,660
{\an8}雷神3：诸神黄昏

106
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:57,940
姑娘们
Girls!

107
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,910
哎呦呦
Well, well, well.

108
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,490
看看是谁决定回来了
Look who decided to pop in.

109
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,910
感谢你吓跑了我的女伴
Thanks for scaring away my company

110
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,930
还弄得我的办公场所全是脑浆
and drenching my workplace in brains.

111
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,720
你是谁
Who are you?

112
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,040
你不记得了吗  斯科尔奇
Don't you remember? I'm Skurge.

113
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,490
我们曾在华纳海姆并肩作战
We fought together on Vanaheim.

114
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,360
想起来了
Right.

115
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,120
海姆达尔呢
Where is Heimdall?

116
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,210
那个叛徒  没人知道  他是王室逃犯
That traitor. Well, no one knows. He's a fugitive of the throne.

117
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,260
叛徒
Traitor?

118
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,580
对  奥丁指控海姆达尔玩忽职守
Yeah. You see, Odin charged Heimdall with negligence of duty

119
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,660
但他在审判前就消失不见了
but he disappeared before the trial.

120
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,100
想抓住一个能洞察宇宙中一切的人可不容易
Hard to catch a guy who can see everything in the universe.

121
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,230
-是啊  -等等
- Sure. - Hold on. Hold on.

122
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,230
我要宣告你的到来的
I'm supposed to announce your arrival.

123
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,310
这是什么玩意
What the hell is that?

124
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,900
哥哥  时候到了
Oh, brother. This is it.

125
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,070
我要离世了
I take my leave.

126
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,680
你真傻  怎么不听我的
You fool, you didn't listen!

127
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,710
对不起
I'm sorry.

128
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,960
希芙女士  去找人帮忙
Lady Sif, get help!

129
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,540
谁来帮帮忙啊
Somebody, help!

130
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,190
我为我做的一切道歉
I'm sorry for all I've done.

131
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,470
没事的  撑住
It's all right. Hold on.

132
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,920
抱歉我企图统治地球
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.

133
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,500
有你只会是他们的幸运
They'd be lucky to have you.

134
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,590
宇宙魔方的事我也很抱歉
I'm sorry about that thing with the Tesseract.

135
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,450
-我就是忍不住  -我知道

136
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,610
-我喜欢耍诡计  -是啊
- I'm a trickster. - Yes.

137
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,100
总爱搞恶作剧
So mischievous.

138
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,670
抱歉我那次把你变成了只青蛙
Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog.

139
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,190
那是很有趣的笑话
It was a wonderful joke.

140
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,350
的确是非常好笑
'Twas indeed hilarious.

141
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,010
你是阿斯加德的拯救者
You are the savior of Asgard.

142
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,720
-讲述我的故事  -我会的
- Tell my story. - I will.

143
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,520
为我建一座雕像
Build a statue for me.

144
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,140
我们会为你建一座大雕像的
We will build a big statue for you.

145
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,980
还要戴着我的头盔  有大弯角的那个
With my helmet on, with the big bendy horns.

146
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,370
你的英勇我会禀告父王
I will tell Father what you did here today.

147
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,010
我不是为了他
I didn't do it for him.

148
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,770
我不是为了他
I didn't do it for him.

149
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,320
不
No!

150
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,310
洛基因伤不治而死
And so, Loki died of his wounds,

151
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,610
他为我们献出了生命
giving his life for ours.

152
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,090
他击退了那些可憎的精灵
He fought back those disgusting elves,

153
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,120
为王国带来了和平
he brought peace to the realm.

154
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,730
洛基  我的儿子
Loki, my boy...

155
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,640
多年前  我在那覆满冰霜的战场上发现了你
'Twas many moons ago I found you on that frostbitten battlefield.

156
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,640
那天  我尚未看出你是
On that day, I did not yet see in you

157
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,700
阿斯加德的拯救者  是啊
Asgard's savior. No.

158
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,740
你只是个小蓝冰棍
You were merely a little blue baby icicle

159
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,480
却融化了我这老傻瓜的心
that melted this old fool's heart.

160
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,540
精彩  精彩  演得好
Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.

161
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,970
父亲
Father.

162
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,240
该死
Shit.

163
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,260
我的儿子  托尔回来了
My son, Thor, has returned!

164
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,860
你好  我的孩子
Greetings, my boy.

165
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,170
这出戏真有趣  叫什么
It's an interesting play. What's it called?

166
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,210
《阿斯加德的洛基之惨剧》
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.

167
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,480
人民想纪念他
The people wanted to commemorate him.

168
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,690
他们是该如此
Indeed they should.

169
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,020
我喜欢那座雕像
I like the statue.

170
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,250
比他在世时要好看多了
A lot better looking than he was when he was alive, though.

171
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,080
不那么猥琐  油腻了
A little less weaselly, less greasy, maybe.

172
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,050
你知道这是什么吗
Do you know what this is?

173
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,610
苏尔特尔的头骨  厉害的武器啊
The skull of Surtur. That's a formidable weapon!

174
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,320
帮个忙  把这个锁进地堡
Do me a favor. Lock this away in a vault

175
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,970
免得它变成巨大的怪物
so it doesn't turn into a giant monster

176
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,550
毁了整个星球
and destroy the whole planet.

177
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,030
谢谢  亲爱的
Thank you, dear.

178
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,820
那么你要回米德加德了吗
So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?

179
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,500
不
Nope.

180
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,000
我最近老做同一个梦
I've been having this reoccurring dream lately.

181
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,780
每晚上  我都看到阿斯加德化为灰烬
Every night, I see Asgard fall into ruins.

182
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,710
不过是个没意义的梦
That's just a silly dream,

183
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,890
说明你的想象力太丰富了
signs of an overactive imagination.

184
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,860
或许吧
Possibly.

185
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,960
但我决定出去勘察一番
But then I decide to go out there and investigate.

186
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,140
结果发现  九大王国一片混乱
And what do I find, but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.

187
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,360
阿斯加德的敌人集结起来  阴谋致我们于死地
Enemies of Asgard assembling, plotting our demise,

188
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,380
而你  奥丁  九大王国的保护者
all while you, Odin, the protector of those Nine Realms,

189
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,320
却穿着浴袍坐在这里  吃着葡萄
are sitting here in your bathrobe, eating grapes.

190
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,640
是啊  我们最好尊重邻居的自由
Yes, it is best to respect our neighbors' freedom.

191
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,830
是啊  被屠杀的自由
Yes, of course, the freedom to be massacred.

192
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,680
是啊  而且  我一直忙着呢
Yes, besides I've been rather busy myself.

193
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,570
看剧
Watching theater.

194
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,060
委员会会议  安全理事会会议
Well, board meetings, and security council meetings...

195
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,200
-你真要逼我这么做吗  -做什么
- You're really gonna make me do it? - Do what?

196
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,140
你很清楚什么都无法阻止雷神之锤回到我手上
You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir as it returns to my hand.

197
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,540
哪怕是你的脸
Not even your face.

198
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,380
你发疯了吧  你会被因此处死的
You've gone quite mad. You'll be executed for this.

199
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,930
那我们就可以在另一边相见了  弟弟
Then I'll see you on the other side, brother.

200
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,410
好吧  我投降
All right, I yield.

201
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,430
看啊
Behold!

202
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,480
托尔
Thor...

203
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,040
-奥丁森  -不
- Odinson. - No.

204
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,120
你就一份工作  就这一份
You had one job. Just the one.

205
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,830
奥丁在哪
Where's Odin?

206
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,540
你就不能别回来吗
You just couldn't stay away, could you?

207
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,080
没有你一切都好好的
Everything was fine without you.

208
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,890
阿斯加德繁荣昌盛  都叫你毁了
Asgard was prospering. You've ruined everything.

209
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,120
-问问他们  -父亲在哪  你杀了他吗
- Ask them. - Where's Father? Did you kill him?

210
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,600
你得到你想要的了  你得到你要的独立了
You had what you wanted. You had the independence you asked for.

211
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,760
好吧  我很清楚他在哪
Okay. I know exactly where he is.

212
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,290
{\an8}荫萌疗养院

213
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,350
我发誓我就是把他留在这儿的
I swear I left him right here.

214
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,780
是在人行道上
Right here on the sidewalk,

215
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,800
还是在那栋正被拆除的建筑里
or right there where the building is being demolished?

216
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,620
计划得真好
Great planning.

217
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,730
我怎么会知道
How was I supposed to know?

218
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,390
我又不能看到未来  我不是巫师
Can't see into the future. I'm not a witch.

219
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,540
是吗  那你为什么穿得像个巫师
No? Then why do you dress like one?

220
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,800
真不敢相信你还活着
I can't believe you're alive.

221
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,230
我看到你死了  我为你哀悼  为你哭泣
I saw you die. I mourned you, I cried for you.

222
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,350
我好荣幸
I'm honored.

223
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,560
去问他
Ask him.

快想想他在哪
Start figuring out where he is.

天呐
Oh, my God.

228

很遗憾简甩了你
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.

229
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,460
她才没甩我
She didn't dump me, you know.

230
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,280
是我甩了她  我们彼此互甩的
I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.

231
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,260
怎么回事  你在做什么
What's this? What are you doing?

232
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,300
这不是我做的
This isn't me.

地球上现在还有男巫了
So, Earth has wizards now?

240
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,500
我们更喜欢被称为"魔法师"
The preferred term is "Master of the Mystic Arts."

241
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,740
别管了
You can leave that now.

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,670
好吧  男巫  你是谁  我为什么要在乎
All right, wizard. Who are you? Why should I care?

我不喝茶
I don't drink tea.

不喝茶
Not tea.

250
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,500
我有一份关注名单

都是来自其他世界
of individuals and beings from

252
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,500
可能对这个世界构成威胁的人

你的领养弟弟  洛基  就是其中之一
Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings.

254
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,900
的确该加上他
He's a worthy inclusion.

255
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,620
为什么带他来这儿
Then why bring him here?

256
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,040
我们在找我父亲
We're looking for my father.

257
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,720
那么  如果我告诉你奥丁在哪
So, if I were to tell you where Odin was,

258
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,380
所有相关人士都会马上回阿斯加德吗
all parties concerned would promptly return to Asgard?

259
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,390
是的  马上
Promptly.

260
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,290
太好了  我来帮你吧
Great! Then I'll help you.

261
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,810
如果你知道他在哪  为什么不联系我
If you knew where he was, why didn't you call me?

262
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,490
我得告诉你  他坚持不许人打搅他
I have to tell you, he was adamant that he not be disturbed.

263

你父亲说他选择继续被流放
Your father said he had chosen to remain in exile.

264
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,790
而且你没有电话
And you don't have a phone.

265
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,910
是啊  我没有电话
No, I don't have a phone,

266
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,940
但你可以发个
but you could have sent

267
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,800
电子信件  叫电邮
an electronic letter. It's called an email.

268
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,180
-嗯  你有电脑吗  -没有  干吗用
- Yeah, do you have a computer? - No. What for?

269
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,800
总之  我父亲不再被流放了
Anyway, my father is no longer in exile.

270
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,720
麻烦你告诉我他在哪  我就能带他回家了
So if you could tell me where he is, I can take him home.

271
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,860
没问题  他在挪威
Gladly. He's in Norway.

272
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,860
我就是查看一下
I'm just seeing

273
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:46,290
这则咒语是否要为阿斯加德人做些调整
whether this incantation requires any Asgardian modifications.

274
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,590
不用
Nope.

275
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,910
我们不需要那个
We don't need that.

276
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,760
你能不能别那么做了
Will you stop doing that?

277
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,110
我可以...我需要你一根头发
Can I... I need just one strand of your hair.

278
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,140
我告诉你  我的头发是碰不得的
Let me explain something. My hair is not to be meddled with.

279
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,900
我们完全可以用走的
We could have just walked.

280
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,980
他在等你了
He's waiting for you.

281
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,480
好
All right.

抱歉

285
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,390
来了
There we go.

286
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,650
我还得要回我弟弟
I suppose I'll need my brother back.

287
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,490
对了  好的
Yeah. Right.

288
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,830
我都下落30分钟了
I have been falling for 30 minutes!

289
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,970
他就交给你了
You can handle him from here.

290
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,070

292
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,840
"交给你"  你是谁

00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,740
洛基
Loki.

294
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,330
你是什么术士吗
You think you're some kind of sorcerer?

295
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,850
你个二流货  别以为你...
Don't think for one minute, you second-rate...

296
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,100
好吧  再见
All right. Bye-bye.

297
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,370

父亲  是我们
Father, it's us.

300
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,330
我的儿子们
My sons.

301
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,220
我一直在等你们
I've been waiting for you.

302
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,140
我知道  我们来接你回家了
I know. We've come to take you home.

303
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,930
回家  是啊
Home, yes.

304
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,170
你们母亲  她在召唤我
Your mother, she calls me.

00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,550
你们听到了吗
Do you hear it?

306
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,850
洛基  解除你的魔法
Loki, lift your magic.

307
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,940
我花了好久才摆脱你的咒语
Took me quite a while to break free from your spell.

308
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,940
弗丽嘉会为你自豪的
Frigga would have been proud.

309
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,260
过来陪我坐下  我没多少时间了
Come and sit with me. I don't have much time.

310
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,840
我知道我们辜负了你
I know we failed you.

311
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,410
但我们可以弥补的
But we can make this right.

312
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,200
是我辜负了你们
I failed you.

313
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,210
诸神黄昏已经到来
It is upon us. Ragnarok.

314
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,130
不  我阻止了诸神黄昏  我了结了苏尔特尔
No, I've stopped Ragnarok. I put an end to Surtur.

315
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,430
不
No.

316
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,060
已经开始了  她要来了
It has already begun. She's coming.

317
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,320
我的生命是唯一遏制着她的东西
My life was all that held her back.

318
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,240
但我大限将至
But my time has come.

319
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,620
我无法再抵住她了
I cannot keep her away any longer.

320
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,470
父亲  你在说谁
Father, who are you talking about?

321
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,900
死亡女神  海拉
Goddess of Death. Hela.

322
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,160
我的长女
My firstborn.

323
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,760
你姐姐
Your sister.

324
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,930
什么
Your what?

325
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,050
她的暴力欲望膨胀到我无法控制
Her violent appetites grew beyond my control.

326
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,500
我无法阻止她  就囚禁了她  把她关了起来
I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her. Locked her away.

327
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,960
她从阿斯加德汲取力量
She draws her strength from Asgard,

328
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,870
等她到了那里  她的力量就将无可限量
and once she gets there, her powers will be limitless.

329
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,310
不管她是什么  我们可以一同阻止她
Whatever she is, we can stop her together.

330
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,860
我们可以一同对抗她
We can face her together.

331
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,870
不行的
No, we won't.

332
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,330
我已走上了另一条路
I'm on a different path now.

333
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,580
这件事你们得独自面对了
This you must face alone.

334
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,660
我爱你们  我的儿子
I love you, my sons.

335
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,060
看啊
Look at that.

336
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,210
记住这地方
Remember this place.

337
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,700
家园
Home.

338
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:27,960
哥哥
Brother.

339
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,550
这都怪你
This was your doing.

340
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,350
他死了啊
So he's gone.

341
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,330
真可惜  我还挺想看到那一幕的
That's a shame. I would've liked to have seen that.

342
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,440
你就是海拉吧
You must be Hela.

343
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,930
我是托尔  奥丁之子
I'm Thor, son of Odin.

344
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,190
是吗  你长得不像他
Really? You don't look like him.

345
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,330
或许我们可以商量一下
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.

346
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,190
你口气像他
You sound like him.

347
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,400
跪下
Kneel.

348
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,880
你说什么
Beg your pardon?

349
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,520
跪下
Kneel.

350
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,660
拜见你的女王
Before your queen.

351
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,290
别指望了
I don't think so.

352
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,020
不可能
It's not possible.

353
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:17,170
亲爱的  你根本想象不到我都能做什么
Darling, you have no idea what's possible.

354
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,500
带我们回去
Bring us back!

355
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,320
不
No!

356
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,680
洛基
Loki!

357
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,740
你是谁  你把托尔怎么了
Who are you? What have you done with Thor?

358
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,770
我是海拉
I'm Hela.

359
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,290
我就是个扫地的
I'm just a janitor.

360
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,900
你看上去像个求生本能强烈的机灵鬼
You look like a smart boy with good survival instincts.

361
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,910
想要份工作吗
How would you like a job?

362
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,620
你是个战士吗
Are you a fighter?

363
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,860
还是食物
Or are you food?

364
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,150
我就是路过
I'm just passing through.

365
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,270
是食物
It is food.

366
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,570
跪下
On your knees.

367
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,360
他是我的
He's mine.

368
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,910
等等
Wait!

369
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:22,860
等等
Wait!

370
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,470
他是我的
He's mine.

371
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,930
如果你们想要他  得过我这关
So if you want him, you go through me.

372
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,760
但我们已经得到他了
But we've already got him.

373
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,120
那好吧  我就先过你们这关
All right, then. I guess I go through you.

374
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,700
又来食物了
More food.

375
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,700
谢谢
Thank you.

376
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:53,280
拾荒者142号  我需要进门并觐见老大
Scrapper 142. I need clearance and an audience with the boss.

377
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,610
我带来了特别的东西
I've got something special.

378
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,130
你要带我去哪
Where are you taking me?

379
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,170
回答我
Answer me!

380
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,990
我是托尔  奥丁之子  我得回阿斯加德
I am Thor, son of Odin. I need to get back to Asgard.

381
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,200
非常抱歉  王子殿下
Many apologies, your majesty.

382
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,280
我发现  你们并不认识我
It's come to my attention that you don't know who I am.

383
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,380
我是海拉  奥丁的长女
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn,

384
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:54,110
阿斯加德大军的统帅
the commander of the Legions of Asgard,

385
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,710
王位的合法继承人  死亡女神
the rightful heir to the throne, and the Goddess of Death.

386
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,030
我父亲已死
My father is dead.

387
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,530
两位王子也是  不客气
As are the princes. You're welcome.

388
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,840
我们曾在宇宙中坐拥无上力量
We were once the seat of absolute power in the cosmos.

389
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,020
我们的地位无可匹及
Our supremacy was unchallenged.

390
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,410
但奥丁却止步于九大王国
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.

391
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,300
我们的命运是统治所有其他王国
Our destiny is to rule over all others.

392
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,240
我是来恢复那份权势的
And I am here to restore that power.

393
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,960
给我跪下
Kneel before me

394
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,970
加入我  与我一起踏上伟大的征途
and rise into the ranks of my great conquest.

395
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,150
不管你是谁
Whoever you are,

396
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,700
不管你做了什么  马上投降
whatever you've done, surrender now!

397
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,860
否则我们绝不留情
Or we will show you no mercy.

398
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,140
不管我是谁  我刚刚说话你听没听啊
Whoever I am? Did you listen to a word I said?

399
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,400
这是你最后的警告
This is your last warning!

400
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,830
我以为你们会乐意见到我呢
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

401
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,360
好吧
Fine.

402
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,380
进攻
Charge!

403
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,740
我真怀念这个
I've missed this.

404
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,760
不过  真是可惜
Still, it's a shame.

405
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,480
好战士白白枉死
Good soldiers dying for nothing,

406
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,740
就因为他们看不到未来
all because they couldn't see the future.

407
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,370
悲哀
Sad.

408
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,560
看  他还活着
Look, still alive.

409
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,580
改主意了吗
Change of heart?

410
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,270
滚回你爬出来的山洞去吧
Go back to whatever cave you crept out of.

411
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,650
你个女魔头
You evil demoness!

412
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,410
去看看我的王宫吧
Let's go see my palace.

413
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,220
别担心  你已被找到
Fear not, for you are found.

414
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,050
你到家了  再也回不去了
You are home, and there is no going back.

415
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,100
没人能离开此地
No one leaves this place.

416
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,050
但这里是什么地方
But what is this place?

417
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,270
这里是  萨卡
The answer is Sakaar.

418
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,330
被宇宙传送门环绕
Surrounded by cosmic gateways,

419
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,420
萨卡位于已知和未知世界的边缘
Sakaar lives on the edge of the known and unknown.

420
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,260
这里收集了所有迷失  不被爱的东西

421
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,580
比如你
Like you.

422
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,900
但在萨卡  你是重要的

423
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,230
你是有价值的
You are valuable.

424
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,270
你是被爱的

425

怎么回事
What the hell?

426
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,130
没人比宗师更爱你了
And no one loves you more than the Grandmaster.

427
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,870
他是最初的  第一个迷失  第一个被找到的人
He is the original, the first lost and the first found.

428
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,520

429
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,960
冠军格斗之父

430
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,380
虽然你曾经一文不名  但现在你有了身份
Where once you were nothing, now you are something.

431
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,630
你是宗师的财产
You are the property of the Grandmaster.

是的

00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,960

你总给我带最好的东西来

442
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,860
托佩兹  每次我们聊起拾荒者142号
Whenever we get to talking, Topaz, about Scrapper 142,

443
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,620
我都怎么说  "她是..."  B开头的词
what do I always say? "She is the..." And it starts with a "B."

444
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,650
垃圾
Trash.

445
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,590
不  不是垃圾
No, not trash.

446
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,710
你是就等着那么说她吗
Were you waiting just to call her that?

447
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,150
都不是B开头的词
It doesn't start with a "B."

448
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,510
酒鬼婆娘
Booze hag.

449
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,450
抱歉  不是  "最好的"
I'm so sorry. No, "Best."

450
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,870
我是想说"最好的"

451
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,200
因为我总说你是最好的

她为我带来了我的格斗冠军呢

每次她来你都这么说

不  是别人付我钱
No, I got paid for this.

00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,710
我想知道的是
Here's what I wanna know.

00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,260
你是谁
Who are you?

470

我没听到雷声
I didn't hear any thunder,

滑稽表演  叫做冠军格斗

来自各处的人  都会不情愿地参与其中

502
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,330
而你  我的朋友  可以加入新卡司
And you, my friend, might just be part of the new cast.

503
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,270

我们不是朋友  我也不在乎你的游戏

508
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,920
我下方有个时间空间的虫洞
There was a wormhole in space and time beneath me.

509
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,930
于是  我放手了
At that moment, I let go.

510
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,050
洛基
Loki?

511
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:49,360

517
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,840
我被困在这张破椅子上了
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.

00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,370
-你怎么没坐椅子  -没人让我坐椅子

521
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,510
什么
What?

522
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,100
我跟那个宗师交了朋友
I've made friends with this man. He's called the Grandmaster.

你们在小声说什么呢
What are you whispering about?

528
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,240
这里的时间规律很不一样
Time works real different around these parts.

529
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,360
在别的世界上  我都该几百万岁了
On any other world, I'd be, like, millions of years old.

530
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,510
但在萨卡上
But here on Sakaar...

531
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:31,410
不管怎样  你认识这个...
In any case, you know this...

532
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,720
你称自己为雷王是吧
You call yourself Lord of Thunder?

533
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,190
雷神  告诉他
God of Thunder. Tell him.

534
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:37,180
我这辈子从未见过这个人
I've never met this man in my life.

535
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,860
-他是我弟弟  -领养的
- He's my brother. - Adopted.

536
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,230
他能不能打
Is he any kind of a fighter?

537
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,180
你把我脖子上的东西拿走  我就打给你看看
You take this thing out of my neck and I'll show you.

538
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,260
瞧瞧  他在威胁我呢
Now, listen to that. He's threatening me.

539
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,130
小火花  事情是这样的
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.

540
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:48,710
如果你想回到那个二死堡还是什么的地方
If you wanna get back to Ass-place, Assberg...

541
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,730
阿斯加德
Asgard.

542
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:52,930
任何参赛者  只要能打败我的冠军
Any contender who defeats my champion,

543
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,140
就能赢得自由
their freedom they shall win.

544
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,590
好啊  那就给我指个路
Fine. Then point me in the direction

545
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,330
要我去揍的人在哪里
of whoever's ass I have to kick!

546
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,050
这才是我的参赛者
That's what I call, contender.

547
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:03,650
这边走  大王
Direction would be this way, Lord.

548
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,330
洛基
Loki!

549
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,420
放松点  哥们
Take it easy, man.

550
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:15,570
这边呢
Over here.

551
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,700
向你招手的一堆石头
The pile of rocks waving at you. Here.

552
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,020
是的  我其实是有生命的
Yeah, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being.

553
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,330
请允许我做个自我介绍
Allow me to introduce myself.

554
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:23,790
我叫寇格  我算是这里的领导吧
My name is Korg. I'm kind of like the leader in here.

555
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,490
你也能看出来  我是石头做的
I'm made of rocks, as you can see.

556
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,360
但不要被我的外表吓到
But don't let that intimidate you.

557
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,940
你不用害怕  除非你是剪刀做的
You don't need to be afraid unless you're made of scissors.

558
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:32,630
就是跟你开个石头剪刀布的小玩笑
Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke for you.

559
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,810
这是我的好朋友  米克
This is my very good friend over here, Miek.

560
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,320
他是只有剪刀手的昆虫
He's an insect and has knives for hands.

561
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,710
你是克努南人  对吗
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

562
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,080
-没错  -你怎么会落到这里
- That I am. - How'd you end up in here?

563
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,410
我试图发动革命来着
Well, I tried to start a revolution,

564
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,950
但没做好宣传工作
but didn't print enough pamphlets.

565
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,580
所以几乎没人参加
So hardly anyone turned up,

566
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,910
除了我妈妈和她那讨厌的男朋友
except for my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate.

567
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,530
作为惩罚  我被迫来到这里做个角斗士
As punishment, I was forced to be in here and become a gladiator.

568
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,540
简直是个宣传灾难
Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.

569
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:59,520
但我其实在策划另一场革命
But I'm actually organizing another revolution.

570
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,580
我不知道你是不是感兴趣
I don't know if you'd be interested in something like that.

571
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,070
你觉得怎么样
Do you reckon you'd be interested?

572
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,930
你怎么会...
How did you...

573
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,610
是啊  这个地方其实是个圈
Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle.

574
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,880
但不是真正的圈  更像是个恐怖怪圈
But not a real circle, more like a freaky circle.

575
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,320
这没道理
This doesn't make any sense.

576
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,910
是啊  这里就是不讲道理的
No, nothing makes sense here, man.

577
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:19,130
没道理就是这里的道理
The only thing that does make sense is that nothing makes sense.

578
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,650
这里有人跟宗师的冠军打过吗
Has anyone here fought the Grandmaster's champion?

579
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:22,710
道格打过
Doug has.

580
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,600
道格
Doug!

581
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,390
这就是命  道格已经死了
Our luck, Doug's dead.

582
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:28,900
对了  跟宗师的冠军打过的人都死掉了
That's right. Everyone who fights the Grandmaster's champion perishes.

583
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,650
你呢  你是石头做的
What about you? You're made of rocks.

584
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,680
会死掉的石头  看啊  又掉一块
Perishable rock. There you go. Another one gone.

585
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,450
我只是小打小闹
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights,

586
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,180
暖暖场之类的
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

587
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,510
等等  你不是要去跟他打吧
Wait. You're not gonna face him, are you?

588
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,550
没错
Yes, I am.

589
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,630
我要跟他打  打赢他  然后离开这鬼地方
Gonna fight him, win, and get the hell out of this place.

590
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,010
道格以前就这么说
That's exactly what Doug used to say.

591
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,890
回见  新道格
See you later, new Doug.

592
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,650
没人记得我吗
Does no one remember me?

593
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:03,470
没人学过我们的历史吗
Has no one been taught our history?

594
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,860
看看这些谎言
Look at these lies.

595
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:13,600
高脚杯  花园聚会
Goblets and garden parties?

596
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,580
和平协议
Peace treaties?

597
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:18,450
奥丁...
Odin...

598
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,330
为成果骄傲
Proud to have it,

599
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:22,520
却觉得手段可耻
ashamed of how he got it.

600
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,200
我们曾势不可挡
We were unstoppable.

601
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,930
在扩张阿斯加德帝国时  我曾是他的武器
I was his weapon in the conquest that built Asgard's empire.

602
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:54,410
我们征服了一个又一个王国
One by one, the realms became ours.

603
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:59,010
然后  就因为我的野心比他更大
But then, simply because my ambition outgrew his,

604
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,480
他就将我放逐  囚禁
he banished me, caged me,

605
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,640
像只野兽一样把我锁了起来
locked me away like an animal.

606
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:06,960
在那之前  阿斯加德的战士是受尊敬的
Before that, Asgard's warriors were honored,

607
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,460
他们的遗体像英雄那样葬在这宫殿下面
their bodies buried as heroes beneath this very palace.

608
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,220
-奥丁的宝藏  -赝品
- Odin's treasures. - Fake.

609
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:27,940
这里大部分的东西都是赝品
Most of the stuff in here is fake.

610
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:29,840
或者没用
Or weak.

611
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,760
比我以为的要小
Smaller than I thought it would be.

612
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,540
这个还可以
That's not bad.

613
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,400
但是这个...
But this...

614
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,290
永恒烈火
The Eternal Flame.

615
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,010
想看看真正的力量是什么样子吗
Want to see what true power really looks like?

616
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:43,280
亲爱的芬里斯  他们对你做了什么
Fenris, my darling, what have they done to you?

617
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,240
永恒烈火将让你们重生
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

618
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,940
我好想你
I've missed you.

619
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:09,490
我想念你们大家
I've missed you all.

620
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,420
奥丁
Odin,

621
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:17,200
我愿你升入英灵殿
I bid you take your place in the halls of Valhalla,

622
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,480
勇者将在那里永生
where the brave shall live forever.

623
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,580
我们应该高兴而不是哀伤
Nor shall we mourn but rejoice,

624
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,900
因为他们死得光荣
for those that have died the glorious death.

625
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,860
扎心  对吗
Hurts, doesn't it?

626
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:37,430
被欺骗的感觉
Being lied to.

627
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,970
告诉你是一回事  然后你发现那都是假的
Being told you're one thing and then learning it's all a fiction.

628
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:48,400
你不会以为我真的会来这里见你吧
You didn't think I'd really come and see you, did you?

629
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,990
这地方太恶心了
This place is disgusting.

630
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,150
你是不想要我帮忙吗
Does this mean you don't want my help?

631
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:57,450
我不能失去我在宗师身边的地位
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position with the Grandmaster.

632
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:58,940
我为赢得他的信任很费心力
It took me time to win his trust.

633
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,540
他是个疯子  但也是有办法应付的
He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable.

634
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,870
我是想告诉你
What I'm telling you is,

635
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:03,930
你可以跟我一起服侍宗师
you could join me at the Grandmaster's side.

636
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:08,700
也许将来  宗师会出事  然后...
Perhaps, in time, an accident befalls the Grandmaster, and then...

637
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,270
你不是真在考虑回去吧
You're not seriously thinking of going back, are you?

638
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:23,810
我们姐姐像砸玻璃一样轻松毁了你的锤子
Our sister destroyed your hammer like a piece of glass.

639
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,470
她比我们都强  她比你强
She's stronger than both of us. She's stronger than you.

640
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:27,880
你一丝机会都没有
You don't stand a chance.

641
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,850
你明白我什么意思吗
Do you understand what I'm saying here?

642
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,540
好吧
Fine.

643
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,530
那我得单干了
I guess I'll just have to go it alone.

644
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,370
一如既往
Like I've always done.

645
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,020
你能不能说点什么
Would you say something?

646
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,960
说话啊
Say something!

647
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,030
你要我说什么
What would you like me to say?

648
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:57,020
你装死
You faked your own death,

649
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,010
偷了王位  剥夺了奥丁的法力
you stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power,

650
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,580
把他留在地球上等死  放出了死亡女神
stranded him on Earth to die, releasing the Goddess of Death.

651
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,430
这些够不够
Have I said enough

652
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:07,380
还是你要我继续翻两天之前的旧账
or would you like me to go back further than the past two days?

653
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:12,660
我还没见过他口中这个宠儿冠军
You know, I haven't seen this beloved champion he talks of,

654
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,040
但听说他野蛮得吓人
but I've heard he is astonishingly savage.

655
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,880
明天的格斗  我下了很大的注压你输
I've placed a large wager against you tomorrow.

656
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,480
别让我失望
Don't let me down.

657
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,660
滚开  鬼
Piss off, ghost!

658
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,470
他消失了
He's freaking gone.

659
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,490
恶心
Yuck!

660
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:41,720
这上面还留着不知谁的毛发和血
There's still someone's hair and blood all over this.

661
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,710
伙计们  格斗完能不能清理下武器啊
Guys, can you clean up the weapons once you finish your fight?

662
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:46,290
恶心的懒蛋
Disgusting slobs.

663
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:50,300
托尔  用大木叉子吗
Thor, wanna use a big wooden fork?

664
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:51,890
不了
No.

665
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:53,300
是啊  不太实用
Yeah, not really useful.

666
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,340
除非你要打挤成一团的
Unless you're fighting off three vampires

667
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,810
三个吸血鬼
that were huddled together.

668
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,380
真希望我的锤子还在
I really wish I had my hammer.

669
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:00,570
锤子
Hammer?

670
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:01,350
很特别
Quite unique.

671
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:05,100
是用濒死星球内核的特别金属制成
It was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star.

672
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,520
我快速抡它
And when I spun it really, really fast,

673
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,020
就能飞起来
it gave me the ability to fly.

674
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,170
你骑在锤子上
You rode a hammer?

675
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,970
不  不是骑在上面
No, I didn't ride the hammer.

676
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:12,180
它骑在你背上
The hammer rode you on your back?

677
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,450
不  我快速抡它
No. I used to spin it really fast,

678
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:16,030
它就会把我带起来...
and it would pull me off the...

679
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:18,260
天啊  锤子给你撸吗
Oh, my God. A hammer pulled you off?

680
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,900
把我带离地面  它会带我离开地面
The ground. It would pull me off the ground,

681
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,920
带我升入空中  我就能飞了
up into the air, and I would fly.

682
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,260
我把它扔出去  它总能回到我手中
Every time I threw it, it would always come back to me.

683
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:27,610
你和这把锤子的关系好像很特殊
Sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship

684
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:28,260
很亲密
with this hammer

685
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,600
失去它堪比失去爱人
and that losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one.

686
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:33,530
这么说挺温馨的
That's a nice way of putting it.

687
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:37,420
我说了这些是我的
I said they're mine.

688
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:41,210
看  就是她把我抓来的
See her, that's the one that put me in here.

689
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,240
是啊  拾荒者142号
Yeah. Scrapper 142.

690
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,380
要小心这些阿斯加德人
Gotta watch out for those Asgardians, man.

691
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,970
命硬得很
They are hard to perish.

692
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:48,470
阿斯加德人
Asgardian?

693
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:57,630
别用那玩意电我  我有话要说
Do not zap me with that thing. I just wanna talk.

694
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:00,300
阿斯加德有危险了
Asgard is in danger.

695
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:06,250
天啊  你是女武神
My God, you're a Valkyrie.

696
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,410
我小时候还想当女武神
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was younger,

697
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:11,890
但之后我发现你们都是女的
until I found out that you were all women.

698
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:14,410
是女的没什么不好  我爱女人
There's nothing wrong with women, of course. I love women.

699
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,940
有时太爱了
Sometimes a little too much.

700
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:19,330
不是猥琐的那种  是尊重的欣赏
Not in a creepy way, just more of a respectful appreciation.

701
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:23,640
能有一支女武士组成的精英部队真的很不错
I think it's great that there is an elite force of women warriors.

702
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,980
是时候了
It's about time.

703
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,000
-你说完没  -雷王  该你了
- Are you done? - Lord of Thunder, you're up.

704
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,600
求你  帮帮我  我需要你的帮助
Please, help me. I need your help.

705
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,290
再见
Bye.

706
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,570
好吧  那你不是叛徒就是懦夫
Fine, then you must be a traitor or a coward.

707
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:35,810
因为女武神都发过誓要保卫王权
Because the Valkyrie is sworn to protect the throne.

708
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,420
听仔细了  殿下  这是萨卡  不是阿斯加德
Listen closely, your majesty. This is Sakaar, not Asgard.

709
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,230
我是拾荒者  不是女武神
And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.

710
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:47,350
带他过来收拾一下
Bring him in for processing.

711
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:51,750
没人能逃出这里  所以你反正也是个死
And no one escapes this place. So you're gonna die anyway.

712
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,690
你别动
Now, don't you move.

713
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,790
我的手不如以前稳了
My hands ain't as steady as they used to be.

714
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:11,110
以奥丁的胡子起誓  你不准剪我的头发
By Odin's beard, you shall not cut my hair,

715
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:14,110
不然就会尝到托尔之怒的滋味
lest you feel the wrath of the mighty Thor.

716
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:20,480
求你了  求你了  好心人  别剪我头发
Please. Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair.

717
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:23,090
求你  不要
Please! No!

718
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,910
不
No!

719
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,130
看看你们  今晚比赛多么精彩
Look at all of you. What a show! What a night!

720
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,160
谁觉得开心
Who's having fun?

721
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,180
我是你们的主持人
Please, I'm your host.

722
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,550
请掌声感谢所有赛前战的格斗者
Big round of applause for all of our undercard competitors,

723
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:51,780
他们今天死得真可怕
who today died so gruesomely.

724
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,950
比赛真棒
Good sports.

725
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:54,950
今晚比赛多么精彩
What a show! What a night!

726
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,050
我们都是为格斗而来的
This is what you've come for, and so have I.

727
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,100
现在  不再耽搁
And now, without further ado,

728
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,060
压轴比赛开始了
it's main event time.

729
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:15,640
虽是首次登场  但却很有潜力
Making his first appearance, though he looks quite promising,

730
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:17,760
有点绝招
got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.

731
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,470
我不再多说了  你们来自己判断
I'll say no more, see what you think.

732
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:22,600
女士们先生们  有请
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...

733
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,000
雷王
Lord of Thunder.

734
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:51,060
小心他的手指  会放火花
Watch out for his fingers. They make sparks.

735
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,790
好了  来吧
Okay, this is it.

736
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:56,320
我们准备欢迎这家伙吧  他来咯
Let's get ready to welcome this guy. Here he comes.

737
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:06,150
他这个家伙
He is a creature.

738
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,920
我们要怎么说呢
What can we say about him?

739
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,560
他很特别  独一无二
Well, he's unique. There's none like him.

740
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,920
我觉得跟他有特别的感情
I feel a special connection with him.

741
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,330
他从未有败绩
He's undefeated.

742
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,740

He's the reigning.

743

744

女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen...

745
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:26,450
有请

绿巨人

748
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:42,830
太好了
Yes!

749
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:48,140
我得离开这个星球
I have to get off this planet.

750
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,090
你想去哪啊
Where you going?

751
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:02,510
我俩认识
We know each other.

752
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:04,290
他是我战友
He's a friend from work.

753
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,200
你去哪了
Where have you been?

754
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:17,350
大家都以为你死了
Everybody thought you were dead.

755
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,760
我们上次一别后发生了好多事
But so much has happened since I last saw you.

756
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,790
我失去了锤子
I lost my hammer.

757
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:25,150
就昨天  还记忆犹新的
Like, yesterday, so that's still pretty fresh.

758
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,520
洛基还活着  相信吗
Loki. Loki's alive. Can you believe it?

759
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,820
他就在上面
He's up there.

760
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,030
洛基  看这是谁
Loki! Look who it is!

761
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,690
班纳  真没想到我会这么说
Banner, I never thought I would say this,

762
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,620
但我见到你可真高兴
but I'm happy to see you.

763
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:40,000
绿巨人  绿巨人
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

764
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:47,580
班纳
Banner.

765
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:49,580
班纳
Banner!

766
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,570
不是班纳  只有绿巨人
No Banner. Only Hulk.

767
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,590
你在干什么
What are you doing?

768
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:56,040
是我啊  托尔
It's me. It's Thor!

这真是疯了  我不想伤你

771
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,620
这就对了  这才像话
Here we go. Here we go.

772
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,200
什么
What?

773
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,120
大块头
Hey, big guy.

774
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:03,990
太阳快下山了
The sun's getting real low.

775
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,210
没错  太阳要下山了
That's it. The sun's going down.

776
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,070
我不会再伤害你了
I won't hurt you anymore.

777
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:23,830
没人会伤害你了
No one will.

778
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,290
没错
Yes!

779
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,070
就是这感觉
That's how it feels!

780
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,580
我就是太喜欢这项运动了
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.

781
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,390
好吧  不管了
All right. Screw it.

782
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,700
我知道你还在的  班纳
I know you're in there, Banner.

783
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,900
我会把你逼出来的
I'll get you out!

784
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,950
你是怎么了  真让我下不来台
What's the matter with you? You're embarrassing me!

785
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:18,840
我还跟他们说我们是朋友
I told them we were friends!

786
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:54,340
雷哥  雷哥
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

787
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:59,460
雷哥  雷哥
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

788
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,990
又一天  又一个道格
Another day, another Doug.

789
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,510
那是什么声音
What is that noise?

790
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,860
民众并没有乖乖听话
The common folk aren't exactly falling in line.

791
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:51,330
有抵抗者想撞倒大门
There's a resistance trying to knock down the front gates.

792
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,880
说说你自己吧  斯科尔奇
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.

793
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,770
我爸是个石匠  我妈是...
Well, me dad was a stonemason. Me mum was...

794
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:05,710
嗯  打住吧  我的意思是
Right, yeah, I'll just stop you there. What I meant was,

795
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:07,150
你的野心是什么
what's your ambition?

796
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,940
我只想要个机会证明自己
I just want a chance to prove myself.

797
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,660
承认
Recognition.

798
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:15,620
我年轻时
When I was young,

799
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,920
每位伟大国王都有个处刑人
every great king had an executioner.

800
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:21,520
不仅仅是进行处刑
Not just to execute people,

801
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,800
也执行国王的愿景
but also to execute their vision.

802
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:28,120
但主要还是做处刑的
But mainly to execute people.

803
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,110
但  这仍是无上光荣
Still, it was a great honor.

804
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,440
我曾是奥丁的处刑人
I was Odin's executioner.

805
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:40,310
你就做我的处刑人
And you shall be my executioner.

806
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,500
我们开始征程吧
Let's begin our conquest.

807
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,770
斯科尔奇  剑呢
Skurge, where's the sword?

808
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,620
那把剑是打开彩虹桥的钥匙
That sword is the key to opening the Bifrost.

809
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,610
你提到的那些人
Those people you mentioned,

810
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:13,590
那些不肯乖乖就范的
the ones who aren't falling into line...

811
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:15,440
把他们都抓起来
Round them up.

812
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:40,400
借过
Excuse me.

813
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:56,030
抱歉了  那些玩意到处都是
Sorry about that. These bloody things are everywhere.

814
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:57,650
走吧
Come on.

815
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:34,200
你们在这里是安全的
You'll be safe here.

816
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:45,330
我们没事了吧
Are we cool?

817
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:50,530
绿巨人洗热浴盆
It's Hulk in a hot tub.

818
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,520
你这样多久了
So how long have you been like that?

819
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,230
什么样
Like what?

820
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,050
这样  大块头  绿色的  呆头呆脑
Like this. Big, and green, and stupid.

821
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:02,140
绿巨人一直是绿巨人
Hulk always Hulk.

822
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:08,120
你怎么到这儿的
How'd you get here?

823
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:10,190
靠赢
Winning.

824
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:11,610
你是说作弊吧
You mean cheating?

825
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:14,110
你赢的时候  对手也都有这玩意吗
Were they wearing one of these when you won?

826
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,800
你怎么来到这儿的
How'd you arrive here?

827
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:19,760
昆式战斗机
Quinjet.

828
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,020
很好  那架昆式战斗机现在在哪
Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?

829
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,570
你没穿衣服
That's naked.

830
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:30,980
他没穿衣服
He's very naked.

831
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:37,100
这下忘不掉了
It's in my brain now.

832

昆式战斗机

01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:52,200
我要带咱们离开
I'm getting us out of here.

835
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:55,090
这个糟糕的地方

839
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:04,270
不不  我的人民需要我回阿斯加德

840
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:06,920
我们得阻止诸神黄昏

841
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,220
诸神黄昏
Ragnarok?

842
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:10,130
我家园的毁灭预言
The prophesied death of my home world.

843
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:12,220
世界末日  一切终结
The end of days, it's the end of...

844
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:15,960
如果你帮我回阿斯加德
If you help me get back to Asgard,

845
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:17,950
我可以帮你回地球

846
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:19,430
地球恨绿巨人
Earth hate Hulk.

847
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:21,400
地球爱绿巨人  他们爱死你了
Earth loves Hulk. They love you.

848
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,610
你是复仇者联盟成员  我们的队友  朋友
You're one of the Avengers. One of the team, one of our friends.

849
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:26,470
朋友就该如此  彼此支持
This is what friends do. They support each other.

850
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:27,970
你是班纳的朋友
You're Banner's friend.

851
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:30,200
我才不是班纳的朋友  我更喜欢你
I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.

852
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,240
班纳的朋友
Banner's friend.

853
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,600
我都不喜欢班纳
I don't even like Banner.

854
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:35,060
"我喜欢数字  科学什么的"
"I'm into numbers and science and stuff."

855
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:37,660
托尔走  绿巨人留下
Thor go. Hulk stay.

856
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:38,340
好吧
Fine.

857

留下吧
Stay here.

858
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:43,500
破地方  难看死了
Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way.

859
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:47,460
又是红  又是白  选个颜色吧  真荒唐
The red, the white. Just pick a color. Ridiculous.

860
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,300
砸扁你
Smash you.

861
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:51,710
你才没砸扁什么  那场角斗我赢了
You didn't smash anything. I won that fight.

862
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:54,130
-我砸扁了你  -好吧
- I smashed you. - Yeah, sure, sure.

863
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:55,990
-小手臂  -什么
- Baby arms. - What?

864
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:56,920
小个子
Baby.

865
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:58,800
白痴  你个幼稚鬼
Moron! You big child.

866
01:05:58,800 --> 01:05:59,780
托尔走

托尔再走

托尔在家了

870
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:25,150

873
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:30,390
你都干什么呢
What have you been up to?

874
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:31,460
获胜
Winning.

875
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:45,020
海姆达尔  我知道你看得到我
Heimdall, I know you can see me.

876
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:49,170
我需要你帮我
I need you to help me.

877
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:52,050
帮我看到
Help me see.

878
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,440
我看得到你  但你在很远的地方
I see you, but you're far away.

879
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:06,800
这里怎么回事
What's going on here?

880
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:08,210
自己来看吧
Come see for yourself.

881
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:14,340
我在祖先建造的要塞里庇护大家
I'm providing refuge in a stronghold built by our ancestors.

882
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:17,730
但如果抵挡不住  我们只能靠彩虹桥逃跑
But if the garrison falls, our only escape is Bifrost.

883
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:19,690
你想要疏散整个阿斯加德
You're talking about evacuating Asgard?

884
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:24,600
如果留下我们都活不久
We won't last long if we stay.

885
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:28,120
她汲取阿斯加德的力量  每天都更强大
She draws her power from Asgard and grows stronger every day.

886
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:28,830
走吧
Come on.

887
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,770
海拉很贪婪
Hela is ravenous.

888
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:35,970
如果我放走了她
If I let her leave,

889
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:38,290
她会吞噬整个九大王国甚至宇宙
she'll consume Nine Realms and all the cosmos.

890
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,120
我们需要你
We need you.

891
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,490
我在想办法了  但我都不知道自己在哪
I'm working on it. But I don't even know where the hell I am.

892
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:44,220
你所在的星球周围都是传送门  穿过其中一个
You're on a planet surrounded by doorways. Go through one.

893
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:45,980
-哪个  -大的那个
- Which one? - The big one.

894
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:16,780
托尔难过
Thor sad.

895
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:17,830
闭嘴
Shut up.

896
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,820
托尔难过
Thor sad.

897
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:25,020
我不难过  你个白痴
I'm not sad, you idiot.

898
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:26,370
我在生气
I'm pissed off!

899
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,880
愤怒  我失去了父亲
Angry. I lost my father.

900
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,290
我失去了锤子
I lost my hammer.

901
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:37,380
-唧唧歪歪  像个孩子  -你都没认真听
- Whining and crying. Cry like baby. - You're not even listening.

902
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,370
别踢东西
Don't kick stuff.

903
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,870
你真不够朋友
You're being a really bad friend.

904
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:44,230
你才不够朋友
You bad friend!

905
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:45,200
-你知道我们怎么喊你吗  -不知道
- You know what we call you? - No.

906
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,490
我们喊你蠢复仇者
We call you the stupid Avenger.

907
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,500
你是小复仇者
You're tiny Avenger!

908
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:53,440
你疯了吗
What, are you crazy?

909
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,310
是啊
Yes.

910
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:57,460
知道吗  地球是恨你
You know what? Earth does hate you.

911
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,720
不要
No.

912
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,060
很抱歉我说了那些话
I'm sorry I said those things.

913
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,740
你不是蠢复仇者
You're not the stupid Avenger.

914
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:29,100
没人喊你蠢复仇者
Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.

915
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:30,760
没事
It's okay.

916
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:33,290
你不能随便冲人仍盾牌
You just can't go around throwing shields at people.

917
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:33,960
差点杀了我
Could have killed me.

918
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,930
我知道  对不起  我总是好生气
I know. I'm sorry. I just get so angry all the time.

919
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:39,170
绿巨人总是很生气
Hulk always, always angry.

920
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:41,200
我知道  我们是一样的
I know. We're the same, you and I.

921
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,830
我们就是俩鲁莽的傻瓜
We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.

922
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:47,920
是啊  一样  绿巨人是火  托尔是水
Yeah, same. Hulk like fire, Thor like water.

923
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,600
我们都是火
We're kind of both like fire.

924
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,590
但绿巨人是真火
But Hulk like real fire.

925
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:56,130
绿巨人是烈火

926
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:58,790
托尔是阴燃火
Thor like smoldering fire.

927
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:02,670
绿巨人  我需要你帮我个忙
Hulk, I need you to do something for me.

928
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:10,650
生气姑娘
Angry girl.

929
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:20,160
怎么了  你...
What's going on? What are you...

930
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:31,270
你就蠢到看不出
You're so thick-headed that you can't tell

931
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:33,190
人家远远躲到了宇宙尽头
when someone's hiding all the way across the universe

932
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:34,450
就是不想被打扰吗
and wants to be left alone?

933
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:37,320
-我们得谈谈  -不  你想跟我谈
- We need to talk. - No, you wanna talk to me.

934
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:38,930
我需要她留下
I need her to stay.

935
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:39,720
留下
Stay?

936
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:41,660
挡住

留下

938

-拜托  -拜托
- Please. - Please.

939
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:50,810
好吧
All right.

940
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:53,940
这样吧
Here's the deal.

941
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:56,410
我听你说
I'll listen to you

942
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,180
喝光这个我就走
till this is empty.

943
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:02,850
阿斯加德有危险  人民在牺牲
Asgard is in danger and people are dying.

944
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:04,900
我们得回去  我需要你帮忙
We need to get back there. I need your help.

945
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:08,620
喝完了  再见
Finished. Bye.

946
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:11,500
奥丁死了
Odin is dead.

947
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:17,340
死亡女神海拉  入侵了阿斯加德
Hela, the Goddess of Death, has invaded Asgard.

948
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,430
如果海拉回来了  那阿斯加德无望了
If Hela's back, then Asgard's already lost.

949
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:21,990
我要阻止她
I'm going to stop her.

950
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:23,990
-一个人吗  -不
- Alone? - Nope.

951
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:25,630
我在组建一支队伍
I'm putting together a team.

952
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:28,500
我  你还有大块头
It's me, you, and the big guy.

953
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:31,240
不  不组队  绿巨人单干
No. No team. Only Hulk.

954
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,100
我和你
It's me and you.

955
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:34,310
我看是只有你
I think it's only you.

956
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:36,740
求你  听我说  女武神都是传奇
Please, listen. The Valkyrie are legend.

957
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:39,590
阿斯加德的精英武士  发誓保护王权
Elite warriors of Asgard sworn to defend the throne.

958
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:40,660
我不要再次
I'm not getting dragged

959
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:42,780
被卷入奥丁的家庭纠纷当中
into another one of Odin's family squabbles.

960
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,580
-这话什么意思  -你姐姐
- What's that supposed to mean? - Your sister.

961
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:46,670
她的力量来自阿斯加德  你也是
Her power comes from Asgard, same as yours.

962
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:48,110
当奥丁无法控制她的力量
When it grew beyond Odin's control

963
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:49,630
她就屠杀了王宫里的每个人
she massacred everyone in the palace

964
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:51,130
企图夺取王位
and tried to seize the throne.

965
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:52,980
她企图逃离驱逐时
When she tried to escape her banishment

966
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,130
他派女武神去抵抗她
he sent the Valkyrie in to fight her back.

967
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,380
我能生还只是因为
I only survived because...

968
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,910
我已经迎战过她一次了
Look, I already faced her once

969
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:03,650
那是我还相信王权的时候
back when I believed in the throne,

970
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,450
而我失去了一切
and it cost me everything.

971
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:07,180
这就是阿斯加德的问题
That's what's wrong with Asgard.

972
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:09,890
王权  秘密  金色的骗局
The throne, the secrets, the whole golden sham.

973
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:10,960
我同意
I agree.

974
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,620
别太亲近了
Don't get familiar.

975
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:15,180
我同意
I agree.

976
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,330
所以我拒绝了王位
That's why I turned down the throne.

977
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:20,360
但关键不在于王位  而是人民
But this isn't about the crown. This is about the people.

978
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,730
他们要死了  他们也是你的人民
They're dying and they're your people, too.

979
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:23,660
忘了他们吧
Forget it.

980
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:25,950
我就做到了
I have.

981
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:27,620
-好吧  -好
- Okay. - Okay.

982
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:29,210
-好  很好  -很好
- Good. Great. - Great.

983
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:30,410
谢谢
Thank you.

984
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:31,750
-谢什么  -这个
- For what? - For this.

985

1078
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:28,230

1079
01:17:28,230 --> 01:17:30,880
太阳要下山了  太阳快下山了
The sun's getting really low. Sun's going down.

你干吗把融化棍递给我
Why are you handing me the melt stick?

1089
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,090
他打断了我
He was interrupting.

1090
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:01,140
那又不是死罪
That's not a capital violation.

1091
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:02,620
我说到哪了
Where was I?

1092
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:05,280
我的宝贝冠军不见了
My precious champion has come up missing,

1093
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,430
这都是因为那个雷王
and it's all because of that Lord of Thunder.

1094
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:08,870
都怪他
It's all because of him.

1095
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:09,900
你哥哥
Your brother.

1096
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:13,340
不管你们怎么回事  是领养还是另有隐情
Whatever the story is. Adopted, or complicated, or you know.

1097
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:14,410
我相信有很多渊源
I'm sure there's a big history.

1098
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:15,740
他是你带来的参赛者
And your contender...

1099
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:17,160
亲爱的朋友
My dear friend,

1100
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,150
如果你能给我12小时
if you were to give me 12 hours,

1101
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:20,900
我可以把他俩都活着带回来
I could bring them both back to you. Alive.

1102
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,170
我两小时就能做到
I could do it in two.

1103
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:24,510
我一小时就能做到
I could do it in one.

1104
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:25,690
打住吧
Let's stop there.

1105
01:18:25,810 --> 01:18:27,350
知道吗  我今早醒来时
You know what? I woke up this morning

1106
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:29,180
想的是公开处决
thinking about a public execution.

1107
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:32,650
但现在  我可以安于
But for now, I'll settle for this sweet little

1108
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:34,410
"谁能先抓到他"
"Who's gonna get him first?"

1109
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:37,850
所以  你们得抓紧了
So, you're on the clock.

1110
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:40,900
你做了什么
What have you done?

1111
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,410
我不听命于你  狗腿子
I don't answer to you, lackey.

1112
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:43,500
是洛基
It's Loki.

1113
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:45,820
你要听命于宗师
And you will answer to the Grandmaster.

1114
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:51,320
你为什么要帮我哥哥和那个绿傻瓜逃跑
Why would you help my brother escape with that green fool?

1115
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:53,060
我不帮任何人
I don't help anyone.

1116
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:00,880
你是个女武神
You're a Valkyrie.

1117
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,150
我以为女武神都惨死了
I thought the Valkyrie had all died gruesome deaths.

1118
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:10,690
接下来要说什么想好了
Choose your next words wisely.

1119
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:14,030
非常抱歉  那记忆一定很痛苦
I'm terribly sorry. Must be a very painful memory.

1120
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:08,720
太阳快下山了  要下山了
The sun's going down. It's getting really low.

1121
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,290
太阳快下山了  要下山了
The sun's going down. It's getting real low.

1122
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:12,660
该死
Oh, shoot.

1123
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:15,900
-太阳快下山了  -你能不能别念叨了
- Sun's getting low. - Would you stop saying that?

1124
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:17,110
我就是需要你保持冷静
I just need you to stay calm.

1125
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:19,220
冷静  我在外星球上
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1126
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:21,070
反正就是个星球  星球你也是去过的
This is just a planet. You've been on a planet before.

1127
01:20:21,070 --> 01:20:21,990
是啊  就一个
Yeah. One.

1128
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:24,010
现在你去过俩了  这是好事
Now you've been on two. That's a good thing.

1129
01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:25,510
-这是新体验  -天呐
- It's a new experience. - Oh, my God.

1130
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:26,470
我的神经元
My neurons,

1131
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:29,570
已经在超过我大脑信息处理速度地运作了
they're firing faster than my brain can handle the information.

1132
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,110
这次的感觉完全不一样
The whole thing is totally different this time.

1133
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,210
以前  我一直觉得
In the past, I always felt

1134
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:35,730
我和绿巨人各有一只手把着方向盘
like Hulk and I each had a hand on the wheel.

1135
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,830
但这次  就好像他拿了车钥匙
But this time, it's like he had the keys to the car

1136
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:39,430
而我被锁在后备箱里
and I was locked in the trunk.

1137
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:41,250
你现在回来了  这才最重要
All right, well, you're back now. That's all that matters.

1138
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:42,270
不  不是的
No, it's not what matters.

1139
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:43,110
我就是想告诉你
What I'm trying to tell you,

1140
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:45,320
如果我再变成绿巨人
is that if I turn into the Hulk again,

1141
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:46,850
班纳可能就再也回不来了
Banner may never come back.

1142
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:50,490
而且我们还困在一颗一切都让我紧张的星球上
And we're stranded on a planet that is designed to stress me out.

1143
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:53,280
我们没被困  我会想到办法回家的
We're not stranded. I'm gonna figure out a way to get us home.

1144
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:54,630
谢谢
Thank you.

1145
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:57,080
不是你家  我的家  阿斯加德
Not your home, though. Asgard. My home.

1146
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:57,810
什么
What?

1147
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,480
听着  我的人民身陷危险
Listen, my people are in great danger.

1148
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:02,900
你和我  我们得去击退一个非常厉害的人
You and I, we have to fight this really powerful being,

1149
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,280
碰巧她还是我姐姐
who also happens to be my sister.

1150
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:06,420
好吧  这太离谱了
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...

1151
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:09,130
我不想打你姐姐  这是家庭问题
I don't wanna fight your sister. That's a family issue.

1152
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:10,470
不  她是邪恶化身
No, she's an evil being.

1153
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,390
我不管她怎么样
I don't care what she is.

1154
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,980
我不要再打谁了  我受够了
I'm not fighting any more beings. I'm sick of it.

1155
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:16,280
-什么  -我刚跟你说了
- What? - I just told you.

1156
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:19,490
如果我再变成绿巨人  我会变不回来的
If I turn into the Hulk, I am never gonna come back again.

1157
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:20,410
你都不在乎
And you don't care.

1158
01:21:20,410 --> 01:21:22,450
不不  我要组建一支队伍
No, no. I'm putting together the team.

1159
01:21:22,450 --> 01:21:23,730
绿巨人是火
The Hulk is the fire.

1160
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:25,840
等等  你是在利用我得到绿巨人
Wait, you're just using me to get to the Hulk.

1161
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:26,570
-什么  -真过分
- What? - It's gross.

1162
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:27,340
什么  不是的
What? No!

1163
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:29,520
你才不在乎我呢  你不是我的朋友
You don't care about me. You're not my friend.

1164
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,750
才不是  我都不喜欢绿巨人  他就...
No! I don't even like the Hulk. He's all like...

1165
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,210
"砸扁  砸扁  砸扁"
"Smash, smash, smash."

1166
01:21:34,210 --> 01:21:35,790
我更喜欢你
I prefer you.

1167
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:37,530
谢谢
Thanks.

1168
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:41,470
但老实说  在对抗邪恶化身这件事上
But if I'm being honest, when it comes to fighting evil beings,

1169
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:42,960
他是很强大很有帮助
he is very powerful and useful.

1170
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,100
班纳也很强大很有帮助
Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.

1171
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:45,750
是吗
Is he though?

1172
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:48,310
好吧  绿巨人有几个博士学位  零
Okay. How many PhDs does Hulk have? Zero.

1173
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,460
班纳有多少个博士学位  七个
How many PhDs does Banner have? Seven.

1174
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,390
好吧  你不用打任何人
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone.

1175
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:55,320
但我们在这里有危险  我们得走了
But we're in danger here, so we have to move.

1176
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:00,150
你拿那个做什么
What are you doing with that?

1177
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:01,710
我需要伪装  我是逃犯
I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.

1178
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:03,970
-我也需要伪装  -你就是伪装
- I need a disguise. - You are the disguise.

1179
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:05,780
-我装成托尼·斯塔克  -什么
- I'll be Tony Stark. - What?

1180
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:08,020
嗯  托尼和吉普赛人
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1181
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:10,540
不  你不是托尼  你是布鲁斯·班纳
No, no, you're not Tony. You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1182
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:11,970
那你为什么把我打扮成托尼
Then why did you dress me up like Tony?

1183
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:13,220
因为你光着呢
Because you were naked.

1184
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,640
好吧  这是个好理由
Okay, I'll give you that.

1185
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:16,390
你干什么呢  别乱抓了
What are you doing? Stop doing that!

1186
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:17,890
托尼的裤子好紧
Tony wears his pants super tight.

1187
01:22:17,890 --> 01:22:19,130
-别抓了  -抱歉
- Stop it! - I'm sorry.

1188
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:21,430
-你为什么怪怪的  -我不知道
- Why are you being so weird? - I don't know.

1189
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:24,050
或许我在一个怪物体内
Maybe the fact that I was trapped for two years

1190
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:27,190
困了两年所以才怪怪的
inside of a monster made me a little weird.

1191
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:28,590
没事的
It's okay.

1192
01:22:28,730 --> 01:22:31,110
你没事的  冷静下来  走吧
You're good. Calm down. Calm down. Come on.

1193
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:32,780
我们去阿斯加德
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard

1194
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:35,020
你再也不用去想绿巨人了
and you're not gonna have to think about the Hulk ever again.

1195
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:36,190
-好吗  -好
- All right? - All right.

1196
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:43,420
绿巨人  绿巨人
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

1197
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:45,370
这可太糟了
This is bad.

1198
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:51,450
班纳  班纳
Banner! Banner!

1199
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:55,860
班纳
Banner!

1200
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:10,830
班纳
Banner!

1201
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:12,580
托尔
Thor!

1202
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:27,470
我正打算那么做呢
I was gonna do that.

1203
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:28,970
我先做了
Yeah, well, I did it first.

1204
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:31,600
很好  你在这儿干什么
That's good. What are you doing here?

1205
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,470
你在这儿干什么  你不是要走吗
What are you doing here? I thought you were leaving.

1206
01:23:33,470 --> 01:23:35,100
出了点小岔子
I got sidetracked.

1207
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:36,620
这是怎么...
What's with the...

1208
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:37,920
是我的伪装
It's my disguise.

1209
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,330
但我能看到你的脸
But I can see your face.

1210
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,210
我这样你不就看不到了
Not when I do this, you can't.

1211
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:42,870
你发型不错
Your hair looks nice.

1212
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:45,770
我喜欢你的处理  换过吗  还是洗了
I like what you did with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?

1213
01:23:51,210 --> 01:23:52,650
她眼睛上那个是什么
What are those things on her eyes?

1214
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:54,030
是她杀过的人吗
Are those people that she's killed?

1215
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:55,840
她好美  强壮又勇敢
She's so beautiful and strong and courageous.

1216
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:56,930
这家伙是谁
Who is this guy?

1217
01:23:56,930 --> 01:23:57,930
-我吗  -我朋友
- Who? Me? - He's a friend.

1218
01:23:57,930 --> 01:23:59,380
-我是布鲁斯  -我觉得我认识你
- I'm Bruce. - I feel like I know you.

1219
01:24:00,030 --> 01:24:01,440
我也这么觉得
I feel like I know you, too.

1220
01:24:06,490 --> 01:24:10,200
听着  我多年来浑浑噩噩  想忘记过去
Look, I've spent years in a haze, trying to forget my past.

1221
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:12,550
萨卡似乎是借酒消愁  忘记过去
Sakaar seemed like the best place to drink and forget,

1222
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:13,950
混吃等死的绝佳之处
and to die one day.

1223
01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:16,110
我是觉得你喝得太多了
I was thinking that you drink too much,

1224
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:17,430
可能会因此没命
and that probably was gonna kill you.

1225
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:19,090
我没打算停止喝酒
I don't plan to stop drinking.

1226
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:21,130
但我不想忘记
But I don't wanna forget.

1227
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:22,260
我不能再扭头不管了
I can't turn away anymore,

1228
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:25,170
所以  如果我要死
so if I'm gonna die, well,

1229
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,120
那不如是为了把我的剑
it may as well be driving my sword

1230
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,940
插进那个屠夫婆娘的心脏
through the heart of that murderous hag.

1231
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:30,320
-很好  -嗯
- Good. - Yeah.

1232
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:33,490
所以  我是说  我想加入你的团队
So, I'm saying that I wanna be on the team.

1233
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:35,090
有名字了吗
Has it got a name?

1234
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,560
嗯  叫报仇者联盟
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.

1235
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:39,460
报仇者
Revengers?

1236
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:42,790
因为我要报仇  你也要报仇
Because I'm getting revenge. You're getting revenge.

1237
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:45,600
还有你  你想报仇吗
You, too. What do you... Do you want revenge?

1238
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:48,410
-我还没决定  -好
- I'm undecided. - Okay.

1239
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:51,210
另外  我还带了示和礼物
Also, I've got a peace offering.

1240
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,500
惊不惊喜
Surprise.

1241
01:25:03,290 --> 01:25:04,300
得确认一下
Just had to be sure.

1242
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:09,530
你好  布鲁斯
Hello, Bruce.

1243
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:14,640
上次我见你时  你想杀了所有人
So, last time I saw you, you were trying to kill everybody.

1244
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:15,890
你现在都在忙什么
Where are you at these days?

1245
01:25:15,890 --> 01:25:17,980
每时每刻都不一样
It varies from moment to moment.

1246
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,420
那是龙牙剑吗
Is that a Dragonfang?

1247
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,430
是的
It is.

1248
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:23,300
天啊
My God.

1249
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:25,960
这就是著名的女武神之剑
This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.

1250
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,690
萨卡和阿斯加德
So, Sakaar and Asgard are about

1251
01:25:27,690 --> 01:25:29,600
之间离得不能更远了
as far apart as any two known systems.

1252
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,240
最好的办法  是走城外的一个虫洞
Our best bet is a wormhole just outside of city limits.

1253
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:36,180
在山达尔补充燃料  18个月后就能回到阿斯加德了
Refuel on Xandar, and we can be back in Asgard in 18 months.

1254
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:39,250
不行  我们要走大的那个
Nope. We are going through the big one.

1255
01:25:39,570 --> 01:25:41,020
魔鬼屁眼
The Devil's Anus?

1256
01:25:41,090 --> 01:25:42,000
屁眼
Anus?

1257
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:43,300
等等  谁的屁眼
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?

1258
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:45,570
声明一下  我选的时候不知道它叫这么个名字
For the record, I didn't know it was called that when I picked it.

1259
01:25:45,570 --> 01:25:47,880
看起来像是在爱因斯坦罗森桥[虫洞]内
That looks like a collapsing neutron star inside of

1260
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:49,820
坍缩的中子星
an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

1261
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:52,690
我们需要另找艘船  它会把我的船撕成碎片
We need another ship. That will tear mine to pieces.

1262
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:54,080
她说得对  我们需要一艘能禁得住
She's right. We need one that can withstand

1263
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,050
奇点短程线拉力的船
the geodetic strain from the singularity.

1264
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:57,980
还得有脱机动力转向系统
And has an offline power steering system

1265
01:25:57,980 --> 01:26:00,420
没有机载电脑也能运行
that could also function without the on board computer.

1266
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:01,920
还得有杯托
And we need one with cup holders,

1267
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,140
因为我们要死了  喝酒吧
because we're gonna die. So, drinks!

1268
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:06,180
我认识你吗  我好像认识你
Do I know you? I feel like I know you.

1269
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:08,060
我也觉得我认识你  好奇怪
I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.

1270
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:08,970
你觉得怎么样
What do you say?

1271
01:26:08,970 --> 01:26:12,020
穿过不稳定的宇宙传送门进行未知总星系旅行
Uncharted metagalactic travel through a volatile cosmic gateway.

1272
01:26:12,030 --> 01:26:13,390
这才叫冒险
Talk about an adventure.

1273
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:15,440
-我们需要一艘飞船  -没错
- We need a ship. - Need a ship.

1274
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:18,050
有那么一两艘飞船  绝对是最顶尖的
There are one or two ships. Absolute top of the line models...

1275
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:19,550
你们不非得听我的
I don't mean to impose...

1276
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,890
但宗师有很多飞船
But the Grandmaster has a great many ships.

1277
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:28,530
我可能还偷到了他安全系统的密码
I may even have stolen the access codes to his security system.

1278
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:31,040
还突然难以抑制地想行正义之举吗
And suddenly you're overcome with an urge to do the right thing.

1279
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,110
天啊  不是
Heavens, no.

1280
01:26:32,110 --> 01:26:33,740
宗师对我的好感已消磨殆尽
I've run out of favor with the Grandmaster,

1281
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:35,830
我用飞船和密码
and in exchange for codes and access to a ship,

1282
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:39,250
换安全穿过屁眼
I'm asking for safe passage through the Anus.

1283
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:42,590
你是说  你能让我们进入机库
You're telling us that you can get us access into the garage

1284
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:44,400
而不触发警报
without setting off any alarms?

1285
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,750
对  哥哥  我可以
Yes, brother. I can.

1286
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:48,970
好  我先...提醒你们一下
Okay, can I just... A quick FYI.

1287
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:51,050
我几分钟前跟他说话的时候
I was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago

1288
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:53,380
他很想杀了我们
and he was totally ready to kill any of us.

1289
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:54,320
他确实想杀我来着
He did try to kill me.

1290
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:56,450
是啊  我也是  好多次呢
Yes, me too. On many, many occasions.

1291
01:26:56,450 --> 01:26:58,130
我们小时候  有一次
There was one time when we were children,

1292
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:00,030
他变成了一条蛇
he transformed himself into a snake,

1293
01:27:00,030 --> 01:27:01,380
他知道我喜欢蛇
and he knows that I love snakes.

1294
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:03,270
我捡起蛇  好好欣赏
So, I went to pick up the snake to admire it,

1295
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:04,880
结果他变了回去
and he transformed back into himself

1296
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:06,080
大喊  "嘿  是我"
and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"

1297
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:09,260
然后捅了我  我们当时才八岁
And he stabbed me. We were eight at the time.

1298
01:27:09,690 --> 01:27:10,810
我们要偷飞船的话
If we're boosting a ship

1299
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:12,810
得把王宫的守卫引开
we're gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace.

1300
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:14,770
放出野兽吧
Why not set the beast loose?

1301
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:15,510
闭嘴
Shut up.

1302
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:16,740
你们有野兽
You guys have a beast?

1303
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:19,210
没有  没什么野兽  他在胡说
No, there's no beast. He's just being stupid.

1304
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,930
我们要挑起革命
We're going to start a revolution.

1305
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:22,820
-革命  -我过会儿再解释
- Revolution? - I'll explain later.

1306
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:25,220
-他是谁来着 -过会儿再解释
- Who's this guy again? - I'll explain later.

1307
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:28,780
你拉出来的
Is that some sort of protoplasm,

1308
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:31,390
是原生质吗  还是卵
all the stuff that's coming out of you, or are they eggs?

1309
01:27:32,490 --> 01:27:33,620
看起来像卵
Looks like eggs.

1310
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,640
我找寇格
I'm looking for Korg.

1311
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,620
谁找我
Who's asking?

1312
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:47,110
我知道是你
I know you're asking.

1313
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,840
还有别人吗  还是只有你
Is there anyone else asking, or is it just you?

1314
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:52,060
雷王向你问好
The Lord of Thunder sends his best.

1315
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:57,270
革命开始了
The revolution has begun.

1316
01:27:57,730 --> 01:27:59,790
革命  怎么会这样
Revolution? How did this happen?

1317
01:27:59,890 --> 01:28:00,650
不知道
Don't know.

1318
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:03,980
但角斗场的服从圆盘主机
But the arena's mainframe for the Obedience Disks

1319
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:05,220
被关掉了
have been deactivated

1320
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:07,340
奴隶都武装起来了
and the slaves have armed themselves.

1321
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:08,850
我不喜欢那个词
I don't like that word.

1322
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:10,330
哪个  主机吗
Which? Mainframe?

1323
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:12,840
不是  我怎么会不喜欢"主机"
No. Why would I not like "mainframe"?

1324
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,120
S开头的那个
No, the "S" word.

1325
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:18,260
抱歉  在职囚犯们都武装起来了
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs have armed themselves.

1326
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:20,920
这样好多了
Okay, that's better. That's better.

1327
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:28,770
听着  我们应该谈谈
So, listen. We should talk.

1328
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:31,180
我不同意
I disagree.

1329
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:34,380
我们家从来就不擅长开诚布公
Open communication was never our family's forte.

1330
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:35,870
可不是呢
You have no idea.

1331
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:38,580
我们上次谈过后发现的真相很是了不得
Been quite the revelation since we last spoke.

1332
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:39,850
你们好
Hello.

1333
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:50,320
奥丁让我们聚在一起
Odin brought us together.

1334
01:28:51,190 --> 01:28:53,840
他的死让我们分裂  还挺诗意
It's almost poetic that his death should split us apart.

1335
01:29:00,290 --> 01:29:01,800
我们现在与陌生人无异
We might as well be strangers now.

1336
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:05,520
两位王子  各自漂泊
Two sons of the crown, set adrift.

1337
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:10,160
你不是不想谈吗
Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.

1338
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:12,860
问题是...
Here's the thing.

1339
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:14,740
我可能留在萨卡更好
I'm probably better off staying here on Sakaar.

1340
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:16,380
我也这么想
That's exactly what I was thinking.

1341
01:29:18,590 --> 01:29:19,880
你刚刚是在同意我说的话吗
Did you just agree with me?

1342
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:21,650
这地方太适合你了
Come on, this place is perfect for you.

1343
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:23,550
野蛮  混乱  无法无天
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...

1344
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:24,910
弟弟  你会在这儿如鱼得水的
Brother, you're gonna do great here.

1345
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:27,490
你就真这么瞧不起我
Do you truly think so little of me?

1346
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:31,210
洛基  我曾非常看重你
Loki, I thought the world of you.

1347
01:29:32,230 --> 01:29:34,210
我以为我们能永远并肩战斗
I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever.

1348
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:37,770
但最终  你是你  我是我
But at the end of the day, you're you and I'm me.

1349
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:40,680
我也说不好  或许你还有一丝良心  但
I don't know, maybe there's still good in you, but...

1350
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:44,310
说实话  我们早已分道扬镳
let's be honest, our paths diverged a long time ago.

1351
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:49,940
是啊
Yeah.

1352
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:53,800
或许我们还是再也不要见面了比较好
It's probably for the best that we never see each other again.

1353
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:55,260
这不是你一直想要的吗
It's what you always wanted.

1354
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:00,720
我们来演"喊救命"吧
Hey, let's do "Get Help."

1355
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,820
-什么  -"喊救命"
- What? - "Get Help."

1356
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:03,500
不
No.

1357
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:04,570
-来嘛  你最喜欢了  -我非常讨厌
- Come on, you love it. - I hate it.

1358
01:30:04,570 --> 01:30:06,440
-这招多棒啊  每次都好使  -太丢人了
- It's great. It works every time. - It's humiliating.

1359
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:07,680
-你有更好的计划吗  -没有
- Do you have a better plan? - No.

1360
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:08,560
那就这么办
We're doing it.

1361
01:30:09,010 --> 01:30:11,040
我才不要演"喊救命"
We are not doing "Get Help."

1362
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:13,580
救命  求你们了
Get help! Please!

1363
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:14,770
我弟弟快死了
My brother, he's dying.

1364
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:16,640
救命  帮帮他吧
Get help! Help him!

1365
01:30:18,860 --> 01:30:19,760
经典
Classic.

1366
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:21,200
我还是讨厌
Still hate it.

1367
01:30:21,410 --> 01:30:23,380
-太丢人了  -我又不丢人
- It's humiliating. - Not for me, it's not.

1368
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:25,990
好了  她让我们上哪艘船来着
Now, which one's the ship she told us to get?

1369
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:27,420
司令号
The Commodore.

1370
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:28,760
好的
Right.

1371
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:33,850
不过我觉得应该也没什么用
Though I feel it won't make much of a difference.

1372
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:38,270
洛基
Loki.

1373
01:30:39,430 --> 01:30:41,040
我知道我背叛过你很多次
I know I've betrayed you many times before,

1374
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,890
但这次真不是针对你
but this time it's truly nothing personal.

1375
01:30:42,890 --> 01:30:46,040
抓到你的赏金会让我过得很阔绰
The reward for your capture will set me up nicely.

1376
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,630
你果然从不是个重感情的人
Never one for sentiment, were you?

1377
01:30:47,630 --> 01:30:49,260
无情会过得更轻松些
Easier to let it burn.

1378
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:50,690
我同意
I agree.

1379
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:00,550
看起来好痛
That looks painful.

1380
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:04,450
亲爱的弟弟  你越来越好猜了
Dear brother, you're becoming predictable.

1381
01:31:04,450 --> 01:31:06,370
我信任你  你背叛我
I trust you, you betray me.

1382
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:08,650
一遍又一遍
Round and round in circles we go.

1383
01:31:08,770 --> 01:31:11,130
洛基  人生  是要成长的
See, Loki, life is about... It's about growth.

1384
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:12,080
是要改变的
It's about change.

1385
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:15,540
但你好像只想保持原样
But you seem to just wanna stay the same.

1386
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:17,500
我想说的是
I guess what I'm trying to say

1387
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:20,600
你永远都只是恶作剧之神
is that you'll always be the God of Mischief,

1388
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:22,610
但你本可不止如此
but you could be more.

1389
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,820
我就把这个留给你了
I'll just put this over here for you.

1390
01:31:27,150 --> 01:31:30,820
好了  我们都还有地方要去  所以祝你好运了
Anyway, all got places to be, so good luck, I guess.

1391
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,300
好了  你能搞定的
All right, you can figure this out.

1392
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:39,880
不过是又一艘宇宙飞船罢了
It's just another spaceship.

1393
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:54,730
忠诚的萨卡人
Loyal Sakaarians,

1394
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:58,560
雷王偷了我的飞船和我最爱的冠军
Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship and my favorite champion.

1395
01:31:59,730 --> 01:32:03,100
萨卡人  升空  把他打下来
Sakaarians, take to the skies. Bring him down.

1396
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:04,980
不要让他离开这个星球
Do not let him leave this planet.

1397
01:32:17,820 --> 01:32:19,630
-打得不错  -谢谢
- Good shot! - Thanks.

1398
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:23,120
开门
Open the doors.

1399
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,060
好
Okay.

1400
01:32:29,530 --> 01:32:31,830
我希望你比看起来要坚强一些
I hope that you're tougher than you look.

1401
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:32,800
为什么
Why?

1402
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,430
我们不该反击什么的吗
Shouldn't we be shooting back or something?

1403
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:48,420
是应该
Yes, we should.

1404
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:50,540
这船上的武器在哪里
Where are the guns on this ship?

1405
01:32:50,590 --> 01:32:52,020
没有武器
There aren't any.

1406
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,890
-这是艘消遣船  -什么
- It's a leisure vessel. - What?

1407
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:57,170
宗师用它来享乐的  群交派对之类的
Grandmaster uses it for his good times, orgies and stuff.

1408
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,780
她刚刚是说宗师用这船办群交派对吗
Did she just say the Grandmaster uses it for orgies?

1409
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:00,590
是的
Yeah.

1410
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:02,240
什么都别碰
Don't touch anything.

1411
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:23,760
不  不
No! No!

1412
01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:28,530
-不  -不
- No! - No!

1413
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:36,430
进来
Get inside!

1414
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:37,880
马上
In a minute.

1415
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:51,040
我该去帮帮她  你过来开
I should probably go and help. Here, take the wheel.

1416
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,840
不行  我不会开这个
No. I don't know how to fly one of these.

1417
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:54,660
你是个科学家  用你的博士学位去搞明白
You're a scientist. Use one of your PhDs.

1418
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:58,490
那些学位都不是外星飞船驾驶啊
None of them are for flying alien spaceships!

1419
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:33,750
好吧  拜托
Okay, come on.

1420
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,440
这上面肯定有枪的
There's gotta be a gun on this thing.

1421
01:34:35,850 --> 01:34:37,080
那看起来好像是枪
That looks like a gun.

1422
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:41,480
今天我生日  今天我生日
It's my birthday. It's my birthday.

1423
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:43,950
今天我生日
It's my birthday.

1424
01:34:50,850 --> 01:34:52,010
好啊
Yeah!

1425
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:11,770
伙计们  我们马上就要进入恶魔屁眼了
Guys, we're coming up on the Devil's Anus!

1426
01:35:18,410 --> 01:35:19,680
在那儿
There she is.

1427
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:21,160
我们逃离的途径
Our ticket out of here.

1428
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:23,420
这是什么
Hey, what's this?

1429
01:35:28,510 --> 01:35:29,230
谢谢
Thank you.

1430
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:32,230
老兄  我们要跳上那艘超大飞船离开这里
Hey, man. We're about to jump on that ginormous spaceship.

1431
01:35:32,230 --> 01:35:33,050
要一起来吗
You wanna come?

1432
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:37,930
你们看起来确实急需一位领袖
You do seem like you're in desperate need of leadership.

1433
01:35:37,930 --> 01:35:39,040
谢谢
Why, thank you.

1434
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,500
来了
Here we go.

1435
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:52,110
该死
Shit.

1436
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,200
阿斯加德人民
Asgardians...

1437
01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:14,020
有不知好歹的人
Some misguided soul

1438
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,780
偷走了彩虹桥之剑
has stolen the Bifrost sword.

1439
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:18,940
告诉我们它在哪里
Tell us where it is

1440
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:22,000
否则后果自负
or there will be consequences.

1441
01:36:25,890 --> 01:36:27,460
严重的后果
Bad ones.

1442
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:31,130
有人说吗
Well?

1443
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:39,470
你
You.

1444
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:44,280
不  住手
No! Stop!

1445
01:36:46,850 --> 01:36:47,580
求你们
Please.

1446
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:19,550
动手啊  处刑人
Well? Executioner?

1447
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:25,670
等等
Wait!

1448
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:27,050
等等
Wait!

1449
01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:30,870
我知道剑在哪
I know where the sword is.

1450
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,350
没想到我还能再回来
I never thought I'd be back here.

1451
01:38:19,450 --> 01:38:21,010
我以为会更美一些呢
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.

1452
01:38:21,330 --> 01:38:24,720
倒不是说它不美  只是着火了
I mean, not that it's not nice. It's just, it's on fire.

1453
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,170
看  山上
Here, up here in the mountains.

1454
01:38:26,170 --> 01:38:28,500
有热信号  那里聚集了很多人
Heat signatures. People clustered together.

1455
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:29,600
她要去找他们了
She's coming for them.

1456
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,950
好  把我丢在王宫  我去引开她
Okay, drop me off at the palace and I'll draw her away.

1457
01:38:31,950 --> 01:38:33,140
你想害死自己吗
And get yourself killed?

1458
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:34,780
困在那里的人才是最重要的
The people trapped down there are all that matters.

1459
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:36,010
我去应付海拉时
While I'm dealing with Hela,

1460
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:37,990
你们得疏散阿斯加德的人民
I need you two to help get everyone off Asgard.

1461
01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:39,740
我们要怎么做啊
How the hell are we supposed to do that?

1462
01:38:40,270 --> 01:38:41,760
我在地面上有人接应
I have a man on the ground.

1463
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:48,980
阿斯加德人民
Asgard.

1464
01:38:52,150 --> 01:38:53,040
她来了
She's here.

1465
01:39:05,150 --> 01:39:06,740
这下飞船有火力了
Now the ship has a gun.

1466
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:08,140
交给我吧
I'll take it from here.

1467
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:11,830
我在武器库发现了这个
I found this in the armory.

1468
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,130
祝你好运
Good luck.

1469
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:18,970
陛下
Your Majesty...

1470
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:22,250
别死了
Don't die.

1471
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:26,290
你懂我意思的
You know what I mean.

1472
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:27,330
别停步
We must keep moving!

1473
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:30,030
去彩虹桥
Go to the Bifrost!

1474
01:41:12,870 --> 01:41:13,750
姐姐
Sister.

1475
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:17,830
你还活着
You're still alive.

1476
01:41:18,230 --> 01:41:21,720
我喜欢你对这里的改造  重装修了啊
I love what you've done with the place. Redecorating, I see.

1477
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:24,000
看来我们父亲解决
It seems our father's solution

1478
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,120
所有问题的思路都是掩盖
to every problem was to cover it up.

1479
01:41:28,150 --> 01:41:29,550
或驱逐
Or to cast it out.

1480
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:35,420
他对你说你有资格  他也对我说过这话
He told you you were worthy. He said the same thing to me.

1481
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:37,330
你瞧
You see?

1482
01:41:38,180 --> 01:41:39,780
你根本不了解他
You never knew him.

1483
01:41:40,550 --> 01:41:42,060
没见过他最辉煌的时刻
Not at his best.

1484
01:41:42,890 --> 01:41:47,380
奥丁和我曾让整个文明淹死在血泪之中
Odin and I drowned entire civilizations in blood and tears.

1485
01:41:47,490 --> 01:41:49,790
你以为这些金子是哪来的
Where do you think all this gold came from?

1486
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:52,430
然后  有一天
And then, one day,

1487
01:41:52,430 --> 01:41:55,050
他突然决定做个仁慈的君王
he decided to become a benevolent king.

1488
01:41:55,490 --> 01:41:57,900
制造和平  保护生命
To foster peace, to protect life.

1489
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:00,720
生下你
To have you.

1490
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:03,360
我能理解你的愤怒
I understand why you're angry.

1491
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:04,510
你毕竟是我姐姐
And you are my sister,

1492
01:42:04,510 --> 01:42:07,250
严格讲  有权继承王位
and technically have a claim to the throne.

1493
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:09,900
相信我  我也愿意别人来统治
And believe me, I would love for someone else to rule.

1494
01:42:09,910 --> 01:42:11,060
但那不能是你
But it can't be you.

1495
01:42:11,070 --> 01:42:14,770
你真是坏透了
You're just the worst.

1496
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:17,770
好吧  起来
Okay, get up.

1497
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:20,020
你坐在我的位置上了
You're in my seat.

1498
01:42:21,410 --> 01:42:23,060
父亲曾对我说
You know, Father once told me

1499
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:26,190
一位明君从不挑起战争
that a wise king never seeks out war.

1500
01:42:26,190 --> 01:42:29,100
但必须时刻做好准备
But must always be ready for it.

1501
01:43:00,890 --> 01:43:01,800
回去
Go back!

1502
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:08,290
回去
Go!

1503
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,080
老实说  我以为你有更大本事呢
To be honest, I expected more.

1504
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:51,340
海姆达尔
Heimdall!

1505
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:54,610
剑
The sword!

1506
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:00,980
我们的不同之处在于
Here's the difference between us.

1507
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:02,520
我是奥丁的长女
I'm Odin's firstborn,

1508
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:05,470
合法继承人  阿斯加德的拯救者
the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard.

1509
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:07,030
你什么都不是
And you're nothing.

1510
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:20,480
如此简单  瞎子都看得清
So simple, even a blind man could see it.

1511
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:26,010
这下你让我想起了爸爸
Now you remind me of Dad.

1512
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,620
那只臭狗打不死
The stupid dog won't die!

1513
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:02,870
没事了  交给我吧
Everything's gonna be all right now. I got this.

1514
01:45:02,870 --> 01:45:04,700
你想知道我是谁
You wanted to know who I am?

1515
01:45:06,210 --> 01:45:07,900
你说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

1516
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:09,410
你会看到的
You'll see!

1517
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:00,620
瞧  谁都别想跑
You see? No one's going anywhere.

1518
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:01,780
我会拿到那把剑
I'll get that sword,

1519
01:46:01,780 --> 01:46:04,150
哪怕我为此要杀光他们每个人
even if I have to kill every single one of them to do it.

1520
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:32,430
伙计
Hey, man.

1521
01:46:34,010 --> 01:46:35,460
我是寇格  这是米克
I'm Korg. This is Miek.

1522
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:37,480
我们要跳上那艘飞船离开这里
We're gonna jump on that spaceship and get out of here.

1523
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:38,390
要一起来吗
Wanna come?

1524
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:51,560
你们的拯救者到了
Your savior is here.

1525
01:46:58,970 --> 01:46:59,890
想我了吗
Did you miss me?

1526
01:47:00,610 --> 01:47:02,570
大家快上船吧
Everyone, on that ship now.

1527
01:47:06,850 --> 01:47:09,150
欢迎回家  我看到你来了
Welcome home. I saw you coming.

1528
01:47:09,150 --> 01:47:09,930
当然了
Of course you did.

1529
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:29,570
虽然是英勇之举  但你们毫无胜算
It's a valiant effort, but you never stood a chance.

1530
01:47:30,030 --> 01:47:30,980
瞧
You see...

1531
01:47:31,730 --> 01:47:34,930
我不是女王  或怪物
I'm not a queen or a monster.

1532
01:47:36,730 --> 01:47:38,460
我是死亡女神
I'm the Goddess of Death.

1533
01:47:39,410 --> 01:47:41,810
你是什么的神来着
What were you the god of, again?

1534
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:55,290
就算是你有两只眼睛时
Even when you had two eyes,

1535
01:47:55,950 --> 01:47:57,630
也只能看清一半
you'd see only half the picture.

1536
01:47:59,270 --> 01:48:02,360
她太强大了  没有锤子  我做不到
She's too strong. Without my hammer, I can't.

1537
01:48:03,330 --> 01:48:05,720
你是托尔  锤子之神吗
Are you Thor, the God of Hammers?

1538
01:48:10,010 --> 01:48:13,610
锤子是用来帮你控制力量  集中力量的
That hammer was to help you control your power, to focus it.

1539
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:16,190
不是你力量的源泉
It was never your source of strength.

1540
01:48:16,940 --> 01:48:19,480
太迟了  她已经夺下了阿斯加德
It's too late. She's already taken Asgard.

1541
01:48:20,330 --> 01:48:22,740
阿斯加德不是一个地方  从来不是
Asgard is not a place. Never was.

1542
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:25,610
这里就可以是阿斯加德
This could be Asgard.

1543
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:28,910
阿斯加德是我们人民的所在
Asgard is where our people stand.

1544
01:48:29,770 --> 01:48:34,620
而现在  那些人民需要你的帮助
Even now, right now, those people need your help.

1545
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:43,710
我不像你那么强大
I'm not as strong as you.

1546
01:48:47,110 --> 01:48:47,800
是啊
No...

1547
01:48:49,610 --> 01:48:50,450
你比我更强大
You're stronger.

1548
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:01,250
告诉我  弟弟
Tell me, brother.

1549
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:03,770
你是什么的神来着
What were you the god of, again?

1550
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:21,440
-你来迟了  -你缺了只眼睛
- You're late. - You're missing an eye.

1551
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:22,640
还没打完呢
This isn't over.

1552
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:32,350
我觉得我们该解散报仇者
I think we should disband the Revengers.

1553
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:34,810
用闪电打她
Hit her with a lightning blast.

1554
01:51:34,810 --> 01:51:35,700
我刚用史上
I just hit her with the

1555
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:37,580
最大的闪电打她了
biggest lightning blast in the history of lightning.

1556
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:38,660
毫无作用
It did nothing.

1557
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:44,930
我们得抵住她  直到大家都上了船
We just need to hold her off until everyone's on board.

1558
01:51:45,410 --> 01:51:46,640
那也不是个完
It won't end there.

1559
01:51:47,230 --> 01:51:50,580
海拉在阿斯加德待得越久  她就越强大
The longer Hela's on Asgard, the more powerful she grows.

1560
01:51:50,710 --> 01:51:51,850
她会找到我们的
She'll hunt us down.

1561
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:54,360
我们得在此时此地阻止她
We need to stop her here and now.

1562
01:51:54,430 --> 01:51:55,580
我们怎么办
So what do we do?

1563
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:57,820
我不要再演"喊救命"了
I'm not doing "Get Help."

1564
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:12,420
阿斯加德不是一个地方  是人民所在
Asgard's not a place, it's a people.

1565
01:52:15,590 --> 01:52:16,370
洛基
Loki,

1566
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:18,560
我们根本不是要阻止诸神黄昏
this was never about stopping Ragnarok.

1567
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:20,900
我们要引发诸神黄昏
This was about causing Ragnarok.

1568
01:52:20,970 --> 01:52:22,740
苏尔特尔的王冠  在地堡里
Surtur's crown, the vault.

1569
01:52:24,010 --> 01:52:24,990
只能如此
It's the only way.

1570
01:52:26,210 --> 01:52:27,310
真大胆  哥哥
Bold move, brother.

1571
01:52:28,890 --> 01:52:29,890
我都不敢想
Even for me.

1572
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:34,520
我们来吧
Shall we?

1573
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:36,910
你先请
After you.

1574
01:53:02,210 --> 01:53:03,400
这真是疯了
This is madness.

1575
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:19,050
走  快走
Go! Go, now!

1576
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:21,470
为了阿斯加德
For Asgard.

1577
01:54:35,770 --> 01:54:37,110
海拉
Hela!

1578
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:05,510
永恒烈火将让你重生
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

1579
01:55:17,190 --> 01:55:18,770
海拉  够了
Hela, enough!

1580
01:55:22,370 --> 01:55:25,020
你想要阿斯加德  它是你的了
You want Asgard, it's yours.

1581
01:55:25,310 --> 01:55:28,650
不管你在玩什么把戏  不会成功的

267
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,000
因为让犯罪现场分散开一点会更好

00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,880
但我不能留下
But I can't stay.

411
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,760
我在外面世界里找到了自己的使命
It's just, I found my calling out there.

412
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,570
我见到了太多贫困的人  不能再视而不见
I've seen too many in need just to turn a blind eye.

413
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,570
我在这里开心不起来
I can't be happy here

414
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,440
因为我知道外面世界里还有一无所有的人
knowing that there's people out there who have nothing.

415
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,820
那你希望瓦坎达做点什么
What would you have Wakanda do about it?

416
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,560
分享我们的资源
Share what we have.

417
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,720
我们可以提供援助

分享技术
and access to technology

419
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,670
庇护难民
and refuge to those who need it.

420
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,730
其他国家也这么做  我们能做得更好
Other countries do it, we could do it better.

421
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,470
我们跟其他国家不一样  娜吉雅
We are not like these other countries, Nakia .

422
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,560
如果世界得知了我们真正的样子
If the world found out what we truly are,

423
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,680
我们拥有什么
what we possess,

424
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,850
我们可能会失去现在的生活
we could lose our way of life.

425
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,090
瓦坎达有足够的力量帮助他人
Wakanda is strong enough to help others

426
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,040
并保护自己
and protect ourselves at the same time.

427
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,050
如果你不是这么固执  本可以当个好王后
If you were not so stubborn, you would make a great queen.

428
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,780
正因为我固执  我才能当个好王后
I would make a great queen because I am so stubborn.

429
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,570
-承认了吧  -如果我想当王后的话
- See, you admit it! - If that's what I wanted.

430
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,540
那是它吗
Is that him?

431
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,470
芭丝特保佑  它还在长吗
Glory to Bast, man. Is he still growing?

432
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,260
当然

I see Nakia is back.

434

你们要再续前缘吗
You guys going to work it out?

435
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:06,670
特查拉
T'Challa...

436
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,400
怎么了
What's wrong?

437
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,920
娜吉雅觉得我们该多做一点
Nakia thinks we should be doing more.

438
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:11,940
怎么多做
More, like what?

439
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,390
援助他国  难民计划
Foreign aid, refugee programs.

440
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,120
你放难民进来
You let the refugees in...

441
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,660
他们只会带来他们的麻烦
They bring their problems with them.

442
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,220
到时瓦坎达就会像其他地方一样了
And then Wakanda is like everywhere else.

443
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,990
如果你要我和我的人
Now if you said you wanted me and my men,

444
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,890
去清扫外面的世界
to go out there and clean up the world,

445
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,210
那我愿意
then I'll be all for it.

446
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,740
但我们从不会
But waging war on other countries

447
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,490
向他国宣战
has never been our way.

448
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,280
你也收到了
You, too, huh?

449
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,120
芭丝特保佑  我们有麻烦了
Bast! We're in trouble.

450
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,230
国王陛下
My king.

451
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,510
亲爱的
My love.

452
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,960
你们绝对猜不到我们刚发现了谁

458
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,340
克劳已经潜逃近30年了
Klaue has escaped our pursuits for almost 30 years.

459
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:20,900
未能逮捕他  或许是我父亲最大的遗憾

460
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,020
我想把克劳抓回来接受审判

461

瓦坎达现在需要的不是一名战士

六个

不管我做什么
What I'm doing or not doing,

没让人知道一位第三世界国家的国王

穿着一身防弹猫咪战服满街跑吗

我觉得我们扯平了
I'd say we were even.

589
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:17,160

注意  瓦坎达国王来了

599
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,550
不能让他带走克劳
He cannot leave with Klaue.

600
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:47,990

我不是来交易的
I'm not here to make a deal.

这里不是不许带武器吗
I thought there were no weapons allowed in here.

615
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,600
按理说是的
There's not supposed to be.

616
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,720
有人可不知道呢
Somebody did not get the memo.

617

好有架势的随从
Well, that is quite the entourage.

619
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:49,670
你是要发新专了吗
You got a mix-tape coming out?

620
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:52,500
是啊  还真有

拜托  别逼我听你的曲子

我就是说  你带了好多人来

好了  别捏了

00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:27,280
-我们得去拿下克劳  -别妄动

我本想买个高档的公文箱

638
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,430
再不动手就没机会了
It's now or never.

639
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,520
别妄动
Stand down!

640
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:52,520
我被发现了
I've been made.

641

我撒钱雨了
I made it rain!

648
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,450
我们走吧  老大
Let's get out of here, boss!

放点音乐  你当这是送葬啊

661
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,980

We're not going to make it!

00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:56,390
继续开
Keep going!

666
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,930
老哥
Brother!

667
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:15,430
那是什么
Hey, what was that?

668
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,570
别想了  你棒棒哒
Don't worry about it. You're doing great.

669
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,270
枪
Guns.

670
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:32,880
真原始
So primitive!

671

那是振金车  白痴

看你的战服
Look at your suit.

677
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,210
你挨了好多子弹
You've been taking bullets,

678
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,270
战服积蓄了不少动能
charging it up with kinetic energy.

679
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,400
绕到卡车另一边
Pull around the truck.

680
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,250
他哪去了
Where'd he go?

681
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:37,040
臭显摆
You show-off.

682
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:39,460
他在那里
There he is!

683
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:42,650

00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,760
跳上来
Hop in.

686
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:19,510
把矛放后备箱里吧
Put that spear in the trunk.

687
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:26,300

我已经开到最快了
I'm going as fast as I can!

689
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,010
右转  右转
Take a right! Take a right!

690
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:37,070
不不
No, no, no!

691
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,270
老哥
Brother!

692
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:04,850
克劳
Klaue!

693
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:08,390
你以为我们会忘记吗
Did you think we would forget?

694
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:19,290
看着我  杀人犯
Look at me, murderer!

695
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,180
这武器你从哪弄来的
Where did you get this weapon?

696
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,280
你们这些蛮子不配拥有它
You savages didn't deserve it.

697
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:30,890
饶命啊  陛下  饶命
Oh, mercy, king. Mercy.

698
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:33,290
你喘的每一口气都是我仁慈的体现
Every breath you take is mercy from me.

699
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:34,420
陛下
King!

700
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,670
世界在看着呢
The world watches.

701
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,150
几位  我们快走吧
Come on. Guys. Let's go, huh?

702
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:46,300
嗯
Yeah.

703
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,520
有人吗
Hello.

704
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,520
我看得到你们  真的
I can see you! I can. I can see you.

705
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:17,580
真是闹得好大
So this is a big mess, huh?

706
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,160
我们不如唱红脸白脸
I figured we could go good cop, bad cop.

707
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:21,340
我先进去跟他谈  然后你们去
I'll talk to him first, then you guys go in.

708
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:24,800
我们不能让他单独跟克劳谈
We can't let him talk to Klaue alone.

709
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:31,170
最好让他单独跟克劳谈5分钟
Better to let him talk to Klaue alone for 5 minutes

710
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,870
别在这里闹不愉快
than to make a scene here.

711
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:36,630
等你审问过他
After your questioning,

712
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:38,640
我们要带他回瓦坎达
we will take him back to Wakanda with us.

713
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,440
什么  不行
What? No.

714
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,390
我很喜欢你
Look, I like you, a lot.

715
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:44,360
但他已经被我缉拿  他哪里都不去
But he's in my custody now. He's not going anywhere.

716
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,150
听着  我光是允许你们来
Listen, I'm doing you guys a favor

717
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,780
就是给你们面子了
by letting you even be in here.

718
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,840
他再敢碰你一次
If he touches you again,

719
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:56,030
我就把他插在那个桌子上
I'm going to impale him to this desk.

720
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,040
她会说英语吗
Does she speak english?

721
00:54:58,530 --> 00:54:59,920
她想说就说
When she wants to.

722
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:02,860
我进去了
I'm going in.

723
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:05,380
等我问完了  你们再上
When I'm done, you guys are up.

724
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:07,170
-罗斯特工  -怎么
- Agent Ross. - Yeah?

725
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,740
我很感谢你在釜山的帮助
I do appreciate your help in Busan.

726
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,210
瞧见没
You see that?

727
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,310
这叫外交
It's called diplomacy.

728
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,500
不客气
You're welcome.

729
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:19,930
奥克耶
Okoye.

730
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:21,940
客气点
Play nice.

731
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,310
美国人啊
Americans.

732
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:26,780
不要再伤害我
Don't hurt me no more

733
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,570
爱是什么
What is love?

734
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:30,870
宝贝  别再伤害我
Baby, don't hurt me

735
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:34,090
不要再伤害我
Don't hurt me no more

736
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,260
你不该相信那些瓦坎达人
You know, you really shouldn't trust the Wakandans.

737
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,760
我跟你才是一类人
I'm much more your speed.

738
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,800
我干这行  谁都不信任
I don't trust anybody, not in this job.

739
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,680
但我对外面那门手臂炮感兴趣
But what I am interested in is that arm cannon out there.

740
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:44,460
那是哪来的
Where'd you get that?

741
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,620
就是被我调试过的旧采矿工具
It's an old mining tool that I made some adjustments to.

742
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,990
但如果你要  我可以给你弄一个
But I can get you one, if you like.

743
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:50,790
你何不说出你供货商的名字
Why don't you give me the name of your supplier,

744
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:52,240
我直接去找他们要
and I'll ask them.

745
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,610
他就在外面
He's right outside.

746
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,740
你自己去问他好了
Why don't you ask him yourself?

747
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:56,900
什么  特查拉吗
What? T'Challa?

748
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,770
你是说你手臂上的武器是瓦坎达来的
You're telling me that weapon on your arm is from Wakanda?

749
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,030
对了
Bingo.

750
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:06,300
你对瓦坎达究竟有什么了解
What do you actually know about Wakanda?

751
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,020
牧羊  纺织  衣服很酷
Shepherds, textiles, cool outfits.

752
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,590
那都是幌子
It's all a front.

753
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,210
探索者找了那里几个世纪
Explorers searched for it for centuries.

754
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:18,280
传说中的黄金城
El dorado, the golden city.

755
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:20,510
他们以为是在南美洲
They thought they could find it in South America,

756
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:23,670
但其实本就是在非洲
but it was in Africa the whole time.

757
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,890
一个科技奇迹
A technological marvel.

758
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:27,520
就因为这个国家脚下
All because it was built

759
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,590
就是世上最珍惜的金属
on a mound of the most valuable metal known to man.

760
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,810
他们称之为"天赐"
Isipho, they call it. The gift.

761
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:35,340
就是振金
Vibranium.

762
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:37,730
振金  嗯  地球上最坚硬的金属
Vibranium, yeah, strongest metal on earth.

763
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,100
不仅仅是金属
It's not just a metal.

764
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,280
他们把它缝进衣服里
They sew it into their clothes.

765
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:44,200
用它为城市供能  开发科技
It powers their city, their tech,

766
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,270
制造武器
their weapons.

767
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:47,830
武器
Weapons?

768
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:48,850
是的
Yeah.

769
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:51,760
我的手臂炮相比之下就像吹叶机
Makes my arm cannon look like a leaf blower.

770
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,960
这真是个美丽的童话
That's a nice fairy tale,

771
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,020
但瓦坎达是个第三世界国家
but Wakanda is a third world country,

772
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,420
而且你把他们的振金都偷走了
and you stole all their vibranium.

773
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:59,140
我偷...
I stole...

774
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:03,520
我都偷走了
All of it?

775
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:07,930
我拿的不过九牛一毛
I took a tiny piece of it.

776
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,580
他们还有整整一山的
They have a mountain full of it.

777
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,900
他们已经开采了数千年
They've been mining it for thousands of years...

778
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,180
却还只是触及了矿藏的表层
And they still haven't scratched the surface.

779
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,500
我是唯一见到了真相
I'm the only outsider who's seen it

780
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,110
还活着出来的外人
and got out of there alive.

781
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:19,560
如果你不信
If you don't believe me,

782
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:23,390
你去问问你的朋友  他的战服是什么做的
you ask your friend what his suit is made of.

783
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:25,820
他的爪子是什么做的
What his claws are made of.

784
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:50,580
你父亲对联合国说
Your father told the UN

785
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:53,680
克劳盗走了你们全部的振金
that Klaue stole all the vibranium you had.

786
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,560
但现在他却说你们还有
But now he's telling me you have more.

787
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,190
你相信一个
And you believe the word

788
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:59,910
捆在椅子上的军火贩的话吗
of an arms dealer strapped to a chair?

789
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,590
这是哪里
Where is that?

790
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,000
后面
Back there.

791
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,680
你们还藏了多少
How much more are you hiding?

792
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,480
外面有情况
Something is happening out back.

793
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:45,870
趴下
Get down!

794
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:52,390
别动
Stand down!

795
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:56,380
找掩护
Cover!

796
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,900
手雷
Grenade!

797
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,250
你们还真是不紧不慢啊
I see you took your time, didn't you?

798
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,560
陛下
My king!

799
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:28,790
陛下
My king.

800
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:30,280
娜吉雅
Nakia.

801
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,200
他替我挡了子弹
He just jumped in front of me.

802
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,470
他在这里是治不好的
I don't think he'll make it here.

803
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:40,640
子弹击中了脊椎
It hit his spine.

804
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,200
给我一颗灵珠
Give me a kimoyo bead.

805
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,650
这能暂时稳定他的情况
This will stabilize him for now.

806
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:00,680
把他交给我们
Give him to us.

807
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,170
我们可以救他
We can save him.

808
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:14,740
我们的任务是抓克劳回去
Our mission was to bring back Klaue.

809
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:16,990
我们失败了
We failed.

810
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:20,860
此人还是外国情报人员
This man is a foreign intelligence operative.

811
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:23,190
我们要如何解释带他进入国境内
How do we justify bringing him into our borders?

812
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:24,980
他替我挡了子弹
He took a bullet for me.

813
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,820
那是他的选择
That was his choice.

814
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,150
那我们就要任由他死去吗
So now we are just supposed to let him die?

815
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:31,400
想想看  如果我们治好了他
Let us consider that we heal him.

816
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:35,180
他有责任向他的国家汇报情况
It is his duty to report back to his country.

817
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:37,950
作为国王  你则有责任保护我们国家
And as king, it is your duty to protect ours.

818
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:40,540
我很清楚我的职责  将军
I'm well aware of my duties, general.

819
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:44,290
我不能任他死去
I cannot just let him die,

820
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:46,830
而我们明明能救他
knowing we can save him.

821
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,790
我们究竟要带他去哪
Where exactly are we taking him?

822
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:00,620
好啊  又带来个受伤的白人让我们治
Great! Another broken white boy for us to fix.

823
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:02,240
这会很好玩的
This is going to be fun.

824
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,780
他不会有事的
He will live.

825
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,290
瓦卡比来了
W'Kabi is here.

826
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:27,990
怎么回事  兄弟  克劳呢
What's going on, brother? Where is Klaue?

827
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:29,750
他不在
He's not here.

828
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:36,100
他从我们掌心里溜走了
He slipped through our hands.

829
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,720
"溜走了"
"Slipped"?

830
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:44,450
你父亲掌权30年  什么都没做
For 30 years, your father was in power and did nothing.

831
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,750
我以为你会有所不同
With you, I thought it'd be different.

832
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:49,680
但看来还是那样
But it's more of the same.

833
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:10,930
我们走吧  老大
Let's get going, boss.

834
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:14,830
你总卖给中情局吗
You always sell to the CIA?

835
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,600
我卖给出价最高者
I sell to the highest bidder.

836
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:19,440
别担心  等我回了约翰内斯堡
But don't you worry. When I get back to Joburg,

837
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:20,850
避过了这阵风头
and I lay low for a bit,

838
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:22,670
我会让你俩拿到工钱的
I'll make sure both you guys get paid.

839
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:24,160
我才不担心钱的事呢
I ain't worried about the money, bro.

840
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,290
我知道你拿得出
I know you good for it.

841
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,100
我们回去的路上  把我们丢在瓦坎达就好
On our way back, just drop us off in Wakanda.

842
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:29,350
你可不想去那里  小子
You don't want to go there, boy.

843
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,350
我想去
Yeah, I do.

844
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,250
放下
Drop it!

845
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,660
否则你们雌雄大盗的组合  就今天解散
Or your little Bonnie and Clyde routine ends today.

846
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,780
马上放下枪
Put your gun down now!

847
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:41,120
对不起
I'm sorry.

848
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,350
-对不起  埃里克  -没事的
- Sorry, Erik. - It's gonna be okay.

849
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,430
你真想去瓦坎达
You really want to go to Wakanda?

850
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,050
他们都是蛮子
They're savages.

851
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:21,310
他们就这么对我们这样的人
This is what they do to people like us.

852
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:22,770
我可不怕烙印
I ain't worried about no brand.

853
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:23,810
看这个
Check these out.

854
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:26,990
每个都代表我杀的一个人
Each one is for a kill.

855
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:30,170
你怎么伤害自己无所谓
You can scar yourself as much as you'd like.

856
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:33,100
在他们看来  你始终是个外人
To them, you'll just be an outsider.

857
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:35,850
你要是以为自己能走进去就是疯了
You're crazy to think that you can walk in there.

858
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:46,110
我还当你是个疯子美国人呢
To think I saw you as some crazy American.

859
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,680
下去
Leave us!

860
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:15,440
你的任务未能如愿
So your mission did not go as planned.

861
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:20,160
我叔叔尼乔布究竟发生了什么
What happened to my uncle N'Jobu?

862
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,660
我父亲说他失踪了
My father told me he disappeared.

863
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:26,210
今天有个男人
There was a man today,

864
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:30,810
戴了跟这枚一样的戒指
wearing a ring identical to this one.

865
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:34,790
那不可能
That is not possible.

866
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:38,810
他帮助了克劳逃脱  而且他戴了这枚戒指
He helped Klaue escape from us and he was wearing this ring!

867
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:40,750
我爷爷的戒指
My grandfather's ring!

868
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,790
别告诉我什么可能不可能
Do not tell me what is possible.

869
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:44,020
告诉我真相
Tell me the truth!

870
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:50,020
有些真相
Some truths...

871
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:56,390
太过沉重  特查拉
Are too much to bear, T'Challa.

872
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,010
那不是由你来决定
That is not your choice to make.

873
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,120
他究竟怎么了
What happened to him?

874
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,490
我向国王保证过不会说的
I promised the king to say nothing.

875
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,270
现在我是你的国王了
I'am your king now!

876
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,700
你叔叔接受了
Your uncle took...

877
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,540
去美国做战士的任务
A war dog assignment in America.

878
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:32,580
你父亲
Your father...

879
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:35,780
把我安插在了那里
Placed me there...

880
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:37,490
观察他
To observe...

881
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:40,380
而他并不知情
Unbeknownst to him.

882
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,740
你叔叔爱上了个美国女人
Your uncle fell in love with an American woman.

883
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:45,820
他们生了个孩子
They had a child.

884
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:49,680
他在那里看到的困苦
The hardships he saw there...

885
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:52,950
让他变得激进
Radicalized your uncle.

886
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:55,350
我袖手旁观了很久
I observed for as long as I could.

887
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:58,110
他们的领袖遭人暗杀
Their leaders have been assassinated.

888
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:00,910
他们的社区被毒品和武器淹没
Communities flooded with drugs and weapons.

889
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:03,680
他们遭受警察暴力  执法过度
They are overly policed and incarcerated.

890
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,540
在世界各地
All over the planet

891
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:06,830
我们的同胞饱受苦难
our people suffer because

892
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:09,390
就因为他们没有反抗的能力
they don't have the tools to fight back.

893
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:11,250
如果有了振金武器
With vibranium weapons,

894
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:12,920
他们可以推翻每一个国家
they could overthrow every country,

895
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,760
瓦坎达可以一统天下
and Wakanda could rule them all

896
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,190
好好治理
the right way.

897
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:20,130
他知道你父亲绝不会答应
He knew your father would not support this.

898
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:23,950
所以  你叔叔背叛了我们
So, your uncle betrayed us.

899
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:25,120
不
No!

900
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,620
他帮助克劳盗取了振金
He helped Klaue steal the vibranium.

901
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,170
不不
No, no, no.

902
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:33,680
你要马上回国
You will return home at once...

903
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,390
并面见议会
Where you will face the council...

904
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:38,090
向他们坦白你的罪行
And inform them of your crimes.

905
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:40,650
他举起枪对准了我
He drew his weapon on me.

906
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:41,360
不
No!

907
01:06:57,950 --> 01:07:01,060
你父亲杀了亲弟弟
Your father killed his own brother...

908
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:05,590
好救我
to save my life.

909
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:12,720
决不许说出去
Speak nothing of this.

910
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,340
那孩子呢
And the child?

911
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,630
我们丢下了他
We left him.

912
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,330
我们必须
We had to...

913
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,820
守住
maintain...

914
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,420
那个谎言
the lie.

915
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:05,230
这是什么
What is this?

916
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,320
一份薄礼
Just a little gift.

917
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:31,390
你是谁
Who are you?

918
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:22,990
好吧  我在哪
All right, where am l?

919
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:26,190
别那么吓我  殖民者
Don't scare me like that, colonizer!

920
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:28,390
什么  我叫埃弗雷特
What? My name is Everett.

921
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:31,550
我知道  埃弗雷特·罗斯
Yes, I know. Everett Ross...

922
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:34,450
前空军飞行员  现中情局特工
Former air force pilot and now CIA.

923
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:35,910
没错
Right.

924
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,380
好吧  这是瓦坎达吗
Okay, is this Wakanda?

925
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:44,060
不  是堪萨斯
No, it's Kansas.

926
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:48,970
韩国是多久之前了
How long ago was Korea?

927
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:50,190
昨天
Yesterday.

928
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:51,280
不可能
I don't think so.

929
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:53,940
枪伤不会魔法般地一夜恢复
Bullet wounds don't just magically heal overnight.

930
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:56,170
在这里可以
They do here.

931
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:58,980
但不是靠魔法  是靠科技
But not by magic, by technology.

932
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:07,090
什么都别碰  我哥哥很快就会回来
Don't touch anything. My brother will return soon.

933
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:33,130
这些火车
These train things...

934
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,910
是磁悬浮的吧
That's magnetic levitation, right?

935
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:37,070
当然了
Obviously.

936
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:41,620
当然了  但我从没见过这么高效的
Obviously, but I've never seen it this efficient.

937
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:45,540
那个灯板  是干什么的
The light panels, what are they?

938
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:48,060
-声波稳定器  -什么
- Sonic stabilizers. - Sonic what?

939
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:51,290
未加工的振金太过危险
In its raw form vibranium is too dangerous

940
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:53,000
不能高速运输
to be transported at that speed,

941
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,510
所以我发明了一种办法让它暂时失效
so I developed a way to temporarily deactivate it.

942
01:10:57,630 --> 01:10:59,220
那些火车上是振金
There's vibranium on those trains?

943
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:01,600
我们周围到处是振金
There's vibranium all around us.

944
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:04,570
我就是靠这个治好了你
That's how I healed you.

945
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:14,440
特查拉呢
Where is T'Challa?

946
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,660
他的灵珠被关闭了
His kimoyo beads have been switched off.

947
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:19,080
我们又不是连体婴  奥克耶
Well, we are not joined at the hip, Okoye.

948
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,320
有个男人出现在了边境
A man showed up at the border

949
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,040
自称是杀了克劳
who claims to have killed Klaue.

950
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:22,750
什么
What?

951
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,430
瓦卡比此刻正在送他去王宫
W'Kabi is transporting him, as we speak, to the palace.

952
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,630
我们得找到你哥哥
We need to find your brother!

953
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:28,830
一个外人吗
An outsider?

954
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:30,300
不  是瓦坎达人
No, a Wakandan.

955
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:31,990
他不是瓦坎达人
He's not a Wakandan.

956
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:35,840
他是我们的人
He's one of ours.

957
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:50,730
他杀了亲弟弟
He killed his own brother...

958
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:53,190
还丢下了一个孩子
And left a child behind...

959
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:54,610
让他一无所有
with nothing.

960
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,250
什么样的国王
What kind of king...

961
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,380
什么样的人会做出这种事
What kind of man does that?

962
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:04,690
人无完人
No man is perfect.

963
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:06,940
你父亲也是
Not even your father.

964
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:09,930
他都没好好安葬他
He didn't even give him a proper burial.

965
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:14,790
我叔叔尼乔布背叛了我们  但我父亲
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us, but my father...

966
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:19,020
他可能制造了更可怕的东西
He may have created something even worse.

967
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:22,740
看着我
Look at me.

968
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:29,610
你不能让你父亲的错误决定你的为人
You can't let your father's mistakes define who you are.

969
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:36,260
你才能决定你要做怎样的国王
You get to decide what kind of king you are going to be.

970
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:44,730
哥哥  你得马上回来
Brother, you need to get here now!

971
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:46,390
埃里克·斯蒂文斯

972
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:49,200
19岁从安纳波利斯毕业

之后加入海豹突击队  去了阿富汗
Joined the SEALs and went straight to Afghanistan,

975
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,250
在那里杀人无数
where he wrapped up confirmed kills,

976
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:56,800
好像在打电游
like it was a video game.

977
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:58,670
开始有了杀人魔头的称号
Started calling him killmonger.

978
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:00,170
他加入了一个联合特种作战司令部的秘密部队
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.

979
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:01,720
他们可不是闹着玩的
Now these guys are serious.

980
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,920
他们会隐藏起来
They will drop off the grid,

981
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:04,210
进行刺杀
so they can commit assassinations

982
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:05,850
颠覆政府
and take down governments.

983
01:13:06,410 --> 01:13:09,450
他有透露过他的身份吗
Did he reveal anything about his identity?

984
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:12,100
他有战士文身
He has a war dog tattoo,

985
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:14,430
但我们并无他的记录
but we have no record of him.

986
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:23,570
这人到底是不是瓦坎达人
Is this man Wakandan or not?

987
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:25,540
告诉我们究竟怎么回事
Tell us what is going on.

988
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:46,860
说吧

说吧
Speak.

990
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:51,980
我来到了你的领地
I'm standing in your house,

991
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:53,870
处决了一个
serving justice to a man

992
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:56,410
盗走你们振金  还杀了你们人的罪人
who stole your vibranium and murdered your people.

993
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,100
这是你们国王没能做到的
Justice your king couldn't deliver.

994
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:06,680
我不管你是不是带来了克劳
I don't care that you brought Klaue.

995
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,240
我之所以没有就地杀了你
Only reason I don't kill you where you stand

996
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,370
是因为我知道你的身份
is because I know who you are.

997
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:14,330
你想怎么样
Now, what do you want?

998
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:16,950
我想要王位
I want the throne.

999
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:20,810
天呐
My goodness.

1000
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:24,460
你们都安安稳稳地坐在这里
Y'all sittin' up here comfortable.

1001
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:26,840
感觉很不错吧
Must feel good.

1002
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,120
全世界还有
It's about two billion people

1003
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,270
20亿跟我们一样黑皮肤的人
all over the world that looks like us.

1004
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:33,560
但他们的生活要艰辛得多
But their lives are a lot harder.

1005
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:36,140
瓦坎达有解放他们所有人的工具
Wakanda has the tools to liberate 'em all.

1006
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:38,710
什么工具呢
And what tools are those?

1007
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:41,750
振金  你们的武器
Vibranium. Your weapons.

1008
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:45,490
我们的武器绝不会用来向世界发动战争
Our weapons will not be used to wage war on the world.

1009
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:49,340
我们不会去评判外人的行为
It is not our way to be judge, jury and executioner

1010
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:51,660
并决定赏罚
for people who are not our own.

1011
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,180
外人
Not your own?

1012
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,920
但生命不是在这个大陆上诞生的吗
But didn't life start right here on this continent?

1013
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,560
那么所有人不都该是你的同胞吗
So ain't all people your people?

1014
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:01,530
我不是所有人的国王  我是瓦坎达的国王
Iam not king of all people. I am king of Wakanda.

1015
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:04,280
我的职责就是
And it is my responsibility

1016
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,420
保证人民的安全

1017
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:07,850
并确保振金

1018
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:10,830
不会落入你这种人手中
does not fall into the hands of a person like you.

1019
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:11,770
儿子
Son.

1020
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:14,310
我们已听够了这骗子的话
We have entertained this charlatan for too long.

1021
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,790
拒绝他的要求
Reject his request.

1022
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:18,700
我还没提出要求呢
I ain't requesting nothing.

1023
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:22,010
-问问我是谁  -你是埃里克·斯蒂文斯

1026
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:27,990
那就是你的身份
That's who you are.

1027
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:29,630
那不是我的名字  公主
That's not my name, Princess.

1028
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:31,180
问我吧  国王
Ask me, king.

1029
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,180

1030

问我

带他走
Take him away.

1032
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,950
你是谁
Who are you?

1033
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:45,840
我叫尼贾达卡  尼乔布王子的儿子
I am N'jadaka, son of prince N'Jobu.

1034
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:47,650

1035
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:50,010
我看到我爸爸尸体上有豹爪印
I found my daddy with panther claws in his chest!

1036
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:52,070
你才不是国王的儿子  你是杀人犯的儿子
You ain't the son of a king. You a son of a murderer.

1037
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:53,340
你撒谎
You're lying!

1038
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:55,630
-撒谎  -恐怕不是  太后陛下
- Lies! - I'm afraid not, queen mother.

1039
01:15:58,330 --> 01:15:59,050
什么
What?

1040
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,880
尼乔布的后人
The descendent of N'Jobu.

1041
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:04,070
伯母好啊
Hey, auntie.

01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,710
我要行使我与生俱来的权利
I'm exercising my blood right

挑战国王的王位

1044
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:13,500
和黑豹的身份
and black panther.

1045
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,460
别这么做  特查拉
Do not do this, T'Challa.

1046
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:21,670
作为尼乔布王子的儿子
As the son of prince N'Jobu,

1047
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:23,830
他有权利这么做
he is within his rights.

1048
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:25,100
他在这里没有任何权利
He has no rights here!

1049
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:27,580
挑战要准备数周
The challenge will take weeks to prepare.

1050
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:30,370
数周  没那个必要
Weeks? I don't need weeks.

1051
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,950
我不需要全国都来  只要他来就行
The whole country ain't gotta be there. I just need him.

1052
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:35,440
还要来个人给我解开镣铐
And somebody to get me outta these chains.

1053
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,080
特查拉  你知道此事吗
T'Challa, what do you know of this?

1054
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:45,910
我接受你的挑战
I accept your challenge.

1055
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:05,610
他打不过特查拉的
He'll never beat T'Challa.

1056
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:07,780
他就该第一次挑战时来
He should've just come to the first challenge

1057
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:09,370
早点了事

1060
01:17:52,850 --> 01:17:54,330
罗斯特工呢
Where is Agent Ross?

1061
01:17:54,590 --> 01:17:57,380
我把他关在办公室里了  他哪都去不了
I locked him in the office. He's not going anywhere.

1062
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:03,180
这是你最后的机会
This is your last chance.

1063
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:07,160
放下武器
Throw down your weapons,

1064
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:09,750
我们可以换个方式解决此事
and we can handle this another way.

1065
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:20,890
我这辈子都在为此刻做准备

我在这个大陆上
I took life from my own brothers and sisters

1071
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:39,190
杀过我自己的同胞
right here on this continent.

1072
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:43,080
这么多死亡
And all this death...

1073
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:46,230
就是为了杀你
just so I could kill you.

1074
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:57,710
挑战开始
Let the challenge begin.

1075

1082
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:35,990
-祖厉  -祖厉  别

1083
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:38,190
是我导致了你父亲的死
I am the cause of your father's death.

1084
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,260
不是他
Not him.

1085
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:40,730

1094
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:04,710

这就是你们的国王吗
Is this your king?

1096
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:16,920
黑豹
The black panther,

1097
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,000
他还要带领你们进入未来
who's supposed to lead you into the future?

01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,620
加油啊  哥哥
Come on, brother!

1099
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:22,460
我们不能做点什么吗
Is there nothing that can be done?

1100
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:25,470
就他吗
...him?

1101
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:28,170
他要保护你们吗
He's supposed to protect you?

1102
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,990
-不  -不
- No. - No!

1103
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:51,040
不
No!

1104
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:56,800
不  我才是你们的国王
Nah. I'm your king.

1105
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,820
-不  -我们得走了
- No! No! - We have to go now!

1106
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:00,460
王太后  我们得走了
Queen mother, let's go!

1107
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:38,670
王太后和苏睿  她们安全吗
The queen mother and Shuri, they are safe?

是的

谢谢
Thank you.

1110
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:43,960
我们得立刻去找她们
We should get to them immediately.

1111
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:45,940
我不能去
I cannot.

1112
01:22:46,330 --> 01:22:48,230
-什么  -虽然我的心与你们同在
- What? - Though my heart is with you.

1113
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,170
我们不能把这个国家交给一个
We cannot turn over our nation to a man

1114
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:54,240
几小时前才到来的男人
who showed up here only hours ago.

1115
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,330
他是王室血脉
He is of royal blood.

1116
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:57,700
-他杀了特查拉  -那是仪式格斗
- He killed T'Challa! - In ritual combat.

1117
01:22:57,710 --> 01:22:59,430
那真的要紧吗
Does that really matter?

1118
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:05,060
你是瓦坎达最伟大的战士
You are the greatest warrior Wakanda has.

1119
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:09,770
帮我推翻他  别让他羽翼丰满起来
Help me overthrow him before he becomes too strong.

1120
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:10,770
推翻
Overthrow?

1121
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:12,580
娜吉雅
Nakia!

1122
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,510
我不是个可以自由来去的探子
I'm not a spy who can come and go as they so choose!

1123
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:23,130
我要忠于王位  不管坐在上面的是谁
I am loyal to that throne, no matter who sits upon it.

1124
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,530
你忠于什么
What are you loyal to?

1125
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,180
我爱他
I loved him.

1126
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:33,650
我也爱我的国家
I loved my country, too.

1127
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:36,430
那你就该效忠国家
Then you serve your country.

1128
01:23:36,430 --> 01:23:39,380
不  我要救我的国家
No. I save my country.

1129
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:49,550
怎么了
What's wrong?

1130
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,260
国王死了
The king is dead.

1131
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:54,820
跟我来  除非你也想一起死
Come with me, unless you want to join him.

1132
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:16,070
先是爸爸
First Baba.

1133
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:19,110
现在又是我哥哥
And now my brother.

1134
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:24,930
妈妈  我们都不能安葬他
Mama, we didn't even get to bury him.

1135
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:33,640
-是我  -娜吉雅
- It's me. - Nakia.

1136
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:35,260
这人是谁
Who is this man?

1137
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:37,320
他是特查拉的朋友  他救了我一命
He's a friend of T'Challa's. He saved my life.

1138
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:39,500
奥克耶呢
Where's Okoye?

1139
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:40,720
她不来了
Okoye is not coming.

1140
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:43,190
她和女子皇家护卫队要效忠新王
She and the dora Milaje will serve the new king.

1141
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,050
等在这里
Wait here.

1142
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:56,390
我们的瓦坎达是怎么了
What has happened to our Wakanda?

1143
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:01,730
让心形草
Allow the heart-shaped herb

1144
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:04,530
赋予你黑豹的神力
to give you the powers of the black panther,

1145
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:07,800
并带你进入先祖之域
and take you to the ancestral plane.

1146
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,440
不是叫你别乱翻我的东西吗
What did I tell you about going into my things?

1147
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:55,090
你找到了什么
What did you find?

1148
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,090
你的家乡
Your home.

1149
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,920
我给了你钥匙  就是希望你有一日能见到那里
I gave you a key hoping that you might see it someday.

1150
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:05,360
对
Yes.

1151
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,490
那里有世上最美的日落
The sunsets there are the most beautiful in the world.

1152
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:13,440
但恐怕你还是不会受欢迎
But I fear you still may not be welcome.

1153
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:16,700
为什么
Why?

1154
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:20,840
他们会说你迷失了
They will say you are lost.

1155
01:27:21,450 --> 01:27:22,510
但我就在这里
But I'm right here.

1156
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,350
不为我流泪吗
No tears for me?

1157
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:35,150
人人都会死
Everybody dies.

1158
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:39,000
这里的生活就是如此
It's just life around here.

1159
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,080
看看我做了什么
Well, look at what I have done.

1160
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:49,130
我早该带你回去的
I should've taken you back long ago.

1161
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:54,650
结果  我们都被抛弃在了这里
Instead, we are both abandoned here.

1162
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,300
或许你的家乡才迷失了
Well, maybe your home is the one that's lost.

1163
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:06,200
所以他们才找不到我们
That's why they can't find us.

1164
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:16,420
呼吸  呼吸  国王陛下  呼吸
Breathe! Breathe, my king, breathe.

1165
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:18,410
呼吸  呼吸
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

1166
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:37,480
那是心形草的效力
The heart-shaped herb did that?

1167
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:41,100
这是全部的了吗
This all of it?

1168
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:43,650
对  这样等再有下任国王时
Yes. So when it comes time for another king,

1169
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:44,800
我们会有所准备
we will be ready.

1170
01:28:45,650 --> 01:28:46,760
下任国王
Another king?

1171
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,590
全烧了吧
Yeah, go ahead and burn all that.

1172
01:28:51,010 --> 01:28:52,750
陛下  我们不能那么做
My king, we cannot do that.

1173
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:54,170
这是我们的传统
It is our tradition...

1174
01:28:57,610 --> 01:29:00,930
我叫你做什么的话  我就不是闹着玩的
When I tell you to do something, I mean that shit.

1175
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:05,490
全烧了
Burn it all!

1176
01:29:55,290 --> 01:29:56,470
在我们那里
You know, where I'm from...

1177
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:59,240
黑人掀起革命时
when black folks started revolutions,

1178
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:01,200
从来没有足够火力
they never had the firepower,

1179
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:03,870
和资源去对抗压迫者
or the resources to fight their oppressors.

1180
01:30:04,450 --> 01:30:05,500
那时候瓦坎达在哪
Where was Wakanda?

1181
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:13,640
到此为止了
Yeah, all that ends today.

1182
01:30:14,180 --> 01:30:17,160
我们在全球每个国家都有探子
We got spies embedded in every nation on earth.

1183
01:30:17,230 --> 01:30:18,470
都已就位
Already in place.

1184
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:20,660
我知道殖民者怎么思考
I know how colonizers think.

1185
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:23,010
我们就用他们的策略对付他们
So we're gonna use their own strategy against 'em.

1186
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:26,960
我们要把振金武器送去给我们的战士
We're gonna send vibranium weapons out to our war dogs.

1187
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:29,870
让他们把武器分给全世界的被压迫者
They'll arm oppressed people all over the world...

1188
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,760
让他们能起义  杀死当权者
so they can finally rise up and kill those in power.

1189
01:30:32,810 --> 01:30:33,920
还有他们的孩子
And their children.

1190
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:36,050
和其他与他们同流的人
And anyone else who takes their side.

1191
01:30:36,610 --> 01:30:38,660
该让他们知道我们真实的样子了
It's time they know the truth about us!

1192
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:40,210
我们是战士
We're warriors!

1193
01:30:40,910 --> 01:30:44,040
世界要大翻盘  这次  我们要占据上风
The world's gonna start over, and this time, we're on top.

1194
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:48,600
瓦坎达将成为日不落帝国
The sun will never set on the Wakandan empire.

1195
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:52,310
瓦坎达能延续至今
Wakanda has survived for so long,

1196
01:30:52,370 --> 01:30:56,030
一直是只在绝对必要时动武
by fighting when only absolutely necessary.

1197
01:30:56,030 --> 01:30:58,950
瓦坎达过去的确是如此行事
Wakanda survived in the past this way, yes.

1198
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:02,290
但世界在改变  将军
But the world is changing, general.

1199
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:06,030
长老们  世界越来越小了
Elders, it is getting smaller.

1200
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:08,180
外面的世界在追赶上来
The outside world is catching up.

1201
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:10,740
很快  局面就会成为不去征服
And soon it will be the conquerors

1202
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:12,810
便会被征服
or the conquered.

1203
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:16,300
我宁可做前者
I'd rather be the former.

1204
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:21,150
你们都听到命令了  我们开始吧
You heard your orders. Let's get to it.

1205
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:24,340
我们要去哪
So where are we going again?

1206
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:27,240
我们要带心形草去贾巴里部落
We're taking the heart-shaped herb to Jabaril and.

1207
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:29,100
心形草  那是什么
Heart-shaped herb? What is that?

1208
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:31,640
服用者能获得增强的能力
It gives whoever takes it heightened abilities.

1209
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:34,230
所以特查拉才那么强壮
It's what made T'Challa so strong.

1210
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:35,890
娜吉雅
Nakia.

1211
01:31:40,190 --> 01:31:41,460
这样不好
I don't like this.

1212
01:31:41,870 --> 01:31:43,490
心形草是我们的
The herb belongs to us.

1213
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:47,470
给姆巴库  可能会造就更大的怪物
We may be creating a bigger monster with M'Baku.

1214
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:57,320
娜吉雅  你该自己服下它
Nakia, you should take it yourself.

1215
01:31:57,820 --> 01:32:01,380
我是个探子  还没有军队
I am a spy with no army.

1216
01:32:02,530 --> 01:32:04,220
我绝无机会的
I wouldn't stand a chance.

1217
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:07,030
我们去吧
We'll go.

1218
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:15,200
天呐
Oh, boy.

1219
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,140
该死
Oh, shit.

1220
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:24,890
低头  保持冷静
Look down. Stay calm.

1221
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:26,130
苏睿
Shuri.

1222
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:28,390
低头
Look down.

1223
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:05,570
我儿子
My son...

1224
01:33:07,730 --> 01:33:10,600
在仪式格斗中被杀
was murdered in ritual combat.

1225
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:12,610
-机会公平吗  -是的  但是
- Were the odds fair? - Yes, but...

1226
01:33:12,610 --> 01:33:14,850
那就不是"被杀"  而是"被击败"
So it was less a murder than a defeat.

1227
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:17,140
-别戳我们的痛处  -闭嘴
- Do not rub our noses in it! - Silence!

1228
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:20,420
在这里  我才有权说话  小丫头
I make the pronouncements here, girl.

1229
01:33:20,430 --> 01:33:24,970
殿下  新王是个美国...
Look, uh, your highness, the new king is a U.S...

1230
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:26,400
新王
The new king...

1231
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:37,240
你不能说话
You cannot talk!

1232
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:38,790
再多说一句
One more word,

1233
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:41,220
我就拿你喂我的孩子
and I will feed you to my children.

1234
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:47,810
我开玩笑的  我们吃素的
I'm kidding. We are vegetarians.

1235
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,920
大猩猩姆巴库
Great gorilla M'Baku...

1236
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:04,050
我们是为此而来
This is why we are here.

1237
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:06,840
我们要把它献给你
To offer this to you.

1238
01:34:07,170 --> 01:34:09,850
一个外人坐在了王位上
An outsider sits on our throne.

1239
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:12,210
只有你能帮我们阻止他
Only you can help us stop him.

1240
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:30,910
跟我来
Come with me.

1241
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:49,380
不可能
Impossible!

1242
01:34:55,110 --> 01:34:56,170
他还有气吗
Is he breathing?

1243
01:34:56,170 --> 01:34:59,010
他陷入了昏迷  生命垂危
He's in a coma. Barely clinging to life.

1244
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:01,190
我们的一个渔人发现了他
One of our fishermen found him

1245
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:02,860
漂到了河边
at the edge of the river border.

1246
01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:04,480
他把他带来给了我
He brought him to me.

1247
01:35:04,530 --> 01:35:05,990
你怎么把他放在雪里
Why do you have him in the snow?

1248
01:35:05,990 --> 01:35:07,290
这是唯一让他不会
It is the only thing keeping him

1249
01:35:07,290 --> 01:35:08,970
去见祖先的东西
from joining the ancestors.

1250
01:35:08,970 --> 01:35:11,370
我们得送他去我的实验室  我在那里能治好他
We need to get him to my lab. I can heal him there.

1251
01:35:11,370 --> 01:35:13,520
带他走吧  他不出几秒就会死
Take him. He'll be dead in seconds.

1252
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:16,710
娜吉雅  心形草
Nakia, the herb.

1253
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:35,570
我呼唤祖先
I call upon the ancestors.

1254
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:37,630
我呼唤芭丝特
I call upon bast.

1255
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:41,240
我跟我儿子  特查拉在一起
I am here with my son, T'Challa.

1256
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,510
治好他
Heal him.

1257
01:35:55,740 --> 01:35:58,580
我们得把他埋起来  盖住他
We must bury him. Cover him. Cover him!

1258
01:35:58,580 --> 01:35:59,360
好
Okay.

1259
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:13,530
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

1260
01:36:13,530 --> 01:36:15,020
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

1261
01:36:15,530 --> 01:36:16,580
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

1262
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:17,950
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

1263
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,500
先祖保佑
Praise the ancestors.

1264
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:22,540
醒醒  特查拉
Wake up, T'Challa.

1265
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:24,760
醒来吧
Wake up.

1266
01:36:27,190 --> 01:36:28,210
儿子
My son.

1267
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:37,750
你该回家来
The time has come for you to come home...

1268
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:40,130
跟我团聚了
And be reunited with me.

1269
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:52,530
为什么
Why?

1270
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:57,640
你为什么不带那男孩回家
Why didn't you bring the boy home?

1271
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,230
为什么  爸爸
Why, Baba?

1272
01:37:03,130 --> 01:37:04,000
他
He...

1273
01:37:05,490 --> 01:37:08,310
他是我选择无视的真相
He was the truth I chose to omit.

1274
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,260
你不该抛弃他
You were wrong to abandon him.

1275
01:37:12,550 --> 01:37:14,520
我选择了我的人民
I chose my people.

1276
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:17,220
我选择了瓦坎达
I chose Wakanda.

1277
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:19,950
我们的未来需要...
Our future depended...

1278
01:37:19,950 --> 01:37:21,230
你错了
You were wrong!

1279
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:23,640
你们都错了
All of you were wrong!

1280
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:27,650
对外面的世界袖手旁观
To turn your backs on the rest of the world!

1281
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:32,300
我们因为害怕被发现
We let the fear of our discovery

1282
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:34,620
而没有做正确的事
stop us from doing what is right!

1283
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:36,920
再不能了
No more!

1284
01:37:41,070 --> 01:37:44,920
我不能留下陪你
I cannot stay here with you.

1285
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:50,910
我不能安心地让他坐在王位上
I cannot rest while he sits on the throne.

1286
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:54,650
他是我们制造出来的怪物
He is a monster of our own making.

1287
01:37:56,110 --> 01:37:59,470
我必须夺回王位  必须
I must take the mantle back. I must!

1288
01:38:01,530 --> 01:38:03,880
我必须纠正错误
I must right these wrongs.

1289
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:16,470
你们有毯子吗
Do you have a blanket?

1290
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:22,630
杀人魔头有军队的完全支持
Killmonger has the full support of our military.

1291
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:23,650
而且
And

1292
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:27,350
他还烧掉了心形草园
he burned the garden of the heart-shaped herb.

1293
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:29,070
当然了
Of course he did.

1294
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:30,420
那是他受的训练
That's what he was trained to do.

1295
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:32,620
他的部队以前曾跟中情局合作
His unit used to work with the CIA

1296
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:34,830
颠覆外国政权
to destabilize foreign countries.

1297
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:37,060
他们总在权力交接时出手
They would always strike at transitions of power...

1298
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:39,340
比如大选之年  或是国王死后
Like an election year, or the death of a monarch.

1299
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:41,960
控制政府  军队
You get control of government, the military...

1300
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:43,800
-我们的资源  -没错
- Our resources. - Right.

1301
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:46,190
圣山
The great mound.

1302
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:48,340
我们的振金  我的科技
Our vibranium, all of my designs.

1303
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:50,620
他会把我们的武器送去全世界
He will send our weapons all over the world.

1304
01:38:54,090 --> 01:38:56,410
你必须带她们安全离开瓦坎达
You must get them out of Wakanda safely.

1305
01:38:56,410 --> 01:38:58,000
-什么  -那你呢
- What? - What about you?

1306
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:00,430
挑战还要继续
The challenge will have to continue.

1307
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:04,180
特查拉  我们不会离开瓦坎达
T'Challa, we will not leave Wakanda.

1308
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:06,230
我有责任保护你们
It is my duty to keep you safe.

1309
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:08,920
如果他拿到了我们的科技
If he gets control of our technology,

1310
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,790
哪里都不会安全了
nowhere will be safe.

1311
01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:32,600
黑豹不死
The black panther lives.

1312
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:35,880
等到他为瓦坎达的命运而战时
And when he fights for the fate of Wakanda

1313
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:38,200
我也会伴他左右
I will be right there beside him.

1314
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:40,750
我也是
As will I.

1315
01:39:41,570 --> 01:39:42,430
我也加入
I'm in, too.

1316
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,440
怎么了  你会需要全部的帮助
What? You're gonna need all the help you can get.

1317
01:39:49,780 --> 01:39:50,890
你们煽情够了没
Are you done?

1318
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:54,340
够了没
Are you done?

1319
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:58,860
可以让我和姆巴库大人单独谈谈吗
Could you give me and lord M'Baku a moment?

1320
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:08,580
谢谢
Thank you.

1321
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:11,300
我欠你个大人情
I owed you a great debt.

1322
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,030
一命换一命
A life for a life.

1323
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,860
我们两清了
Consider it paid.

1324
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:18,700
请允许我母亲留下
Please allow my mother to stay here.

1325
01:40:19,530 --> 01:40:21,940
她不会有事的  我保证
No harm will come to her. I give you my word.

1326
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:26,060
我还挺需要支军队的
You know, I could use an army as well.

1327
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:27,670
当然了
I bet you could.

1328
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:30,150
但不行
But no.

1329
01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:34,720
我不能让贾巴里人为你的使命送死
I will give no Jabari lives towards your cause.

1330
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:36,170
这是我们的使命
It is our cause.

1331
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:39,070
-这是为了我们所有人  -我们吗
- It is for all of us. - Oh, us'?

1332
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:41,880
你是几世纪来第一个屈尊到此的国王
Us? You are the first king to come here in centuries,

1333
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:46,070
还说什么"我们"
and now you speak of "Us"?

1334
01:40:47,210 --> 01:40:49,510
我无法代表先王们
I cannot speak for past kings.

1335
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:53,220
但此刻  有敌人坐在王座上
But an enemy sits on the throne right now.

1336
01:40:53,670 --> 01:40:55,910
我们都清楚振金的威力
We both know the power of vibranium.

1337
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:59,110
如果杀人魔头拿到了它
If Killmonger gains control of it,

1338
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:01,180
你觉得他会来找谁
who do you think he will come for next?

1339
01:41:07,950 --> 01:41:09,690
我们不会
We will not

1340
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:12,290
帮你的
